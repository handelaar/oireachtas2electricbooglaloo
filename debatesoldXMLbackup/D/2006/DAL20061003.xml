      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I was going to suggest that there could be an increase in the number of requests for information from the Department of the Taoiseach.  There were 142 requests in 2003, 45 in 2004 and 61 in 2005.  It appears the decline will continue in 2006, probably due to the nature of the charge and the restrictions introduced by the Minister for Finance.  Will the Taoiseach comment on this matter?</P>
        <P>Is it a general principle for new agencies set up by the Government to automatically be covered by the freedom of information legislation, such as a new agency under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The operation of the Act is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  These questions refer to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was the Minister for Finance and is now the Head of Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I suggest that the Deputy submit his question to the current Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>As a matter of policy, will new agencies, even those set up under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own Department, be automatically included under the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first question, the Deputy knows from the charts that the figures go up and down.  While they came down initially after the changes in 2003, they wavered up and down in the period since then.  At the beginning of this year, the figure was high and it was high in April.  Some months the figure is low and some months it is high.  It has levelled out at a trend over the past few years.</P>
        <P>In May of this year, 130 additional public bodies and groups were brought within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act.  Generally, unless there is some particular reason it should not be the case, any new agency would be covered by the Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach have a breakdown by category of the freedom of information requests to his Department?  Is that something his Department does?  Does the Taoiseach have a breakdown of the number of requests from journalists and those from members of the wider public?  If so, will he indicate the numbers approved or refused in each category?  In respect of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department and the wider context, has he taken on board the concerns expressed by the Information Commissioner going back over the past couple of years at least?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have taken them on board.  Changes in direction by the Department of Fin<Col N="1212"/>ance are taken on board.  We follow them and do not alter them.  A significant majority of requests &mdash; 62% &mdash; to my Department are submitted by journalists, others account for 25%, business interests make up 8% of applications and Oireachtas Members have submitted 5% of applications.  That has been the consistent trend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach estimate whether the increasing number of requests is linked to the increase in the number of bodies covered by the FOI Act?  In respect of the Department of the Taoiseach, for example, the Law Reform Commission is not covered.  Is there any good reason for this, given that the commission is his Department&rsquo;s responsibility?  Has the Taoiseach taken the advice of the Information Commissioner, who points to South Africa&rsquo;s wide-ranging and liberal legislation in this regard?  Would the Taoiseach consider any recommendation in respect of the Law Reform Commission, given that many people believe it should be covered by freedom of information provisions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When the last review was done in May and the 130 additional bodies and groups were brought within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act, the bodies under the aegis of my Department, with the exception of the Law Reform Commission, were already within the scope of the Act.  The question of extending the Freedom of Information Act to the Law Reform Commission is under consideration, but no decision has been made yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the Taoiseach&rsquo;s substantial experience in government and recalling the debate that surrounded the introduction of the original freedom of information legislation where those opponents articulated a view that it would hamper decision-making and reduce the quality and clarity of the decision-making process within the confidentiality of the public service, what is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view on whether the Act has reduced the quality of decision-making or made it more tortuous?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question refers specifically to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I mean his Department.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for that helpful clarification.  Has the operation of the legislation in the Department of the Taoiseach had the effect that its opponents prophesied it would?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember the debates and the various arguments.  Following the initial rush when there was an enormous number of queries, particularly from the public, about various issues, the number of freedom of information requests <Col N="1213"/>has settled down to an even keel.  I have been very much in favour of its extension to other bodies.  It has not created any difficulties that are readily apparent.  The system operates well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a rumour to the effect that in some cases civil servants are reluctant to commit to paper opinions or options, and that there has been a vast increase in the purchase of Post-its within the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments.  Is there any substance to that rumour?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not just a matter of FOI.  The change I have seen over the years is one with which Deputy Quinn will be familiar.  In the old days, a long time back, a file was circulated to sections.  As Deputy Quinn will recall, the opinions of EOs, HEOs and assistant principals tended to be written in manuscript on files.  I have not seen a file like that in a long time.  I would put it down not just to FOI but to the committee system, various investigations and other issues.  Under the old system, I enjoyed following the train of an argument through the relevant sections and picking up what middle-ranking people would say as distinct from what others would say.  It was always an interesting read, but I have not seen such a file in a long time.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will report on his Department&rsquo;s expenditure in the first half of 2006; the way in which this compares with the first half of 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[30670/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
        <P>Expenditure by my Department from January 2006 to the end of August 2006 was &euro;19.547 million compared with a total Estimates provision for the year of &euro;37.675 million.  This compares with total expenditure of &euro;18.047 million for the period to end August 2005, an increase of 8.3%.</P>
        <P>While fluctuations in spending occur from month to month and some expenditures do not fall due until the end of the year, I am satisfied that overall spending by my Department for 2006 will remain within the agreed Revised Estimates for the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am strongly of the opinion that we should revive the discussion about the European constitution.  Does the Taoiseach possess a figure for the allocation for the activities of the <Col N="1214"/>National Forum on Europe for 2006 and is there a tentative figure for 2007, in view of the importance of that matter and the fact that the French and the Dutch must make their decisions as well?</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Development office incorporates the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance.  Will the Taoiseach provide a breakdown of the level of funding allocated by his Department to each of these agencies for 2006?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Forum on Europe comes under subhead N in my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  The Estimate provision for the year is &euro;1.491 million.  Up to the end of August, &euro;835,312 had been expended and the balance remaining is &euro;655,688.  That allocation was increased at the beginning of the year.  Most of the allocations should come in on target, depending on various expenditures, but the month on month figures are not reliable.  Sufficient resources are available.  Discussions are ongoing regarding the 2007 Estimates but I am conscious we should keep the forum going at its existing level.  There should not be a difficulty meeting its allocation for 2007.  There is no great issue, as it is seen as doing a good job and its publications are useful.  The forum extended its reach during the summer months to locations where large numbers of the public were in attendance and that worked well.  The staff has been engaged in meeting and addressing the people.</P>
        <P>The NCCP, the NESF and the NESC are covered under separate subheads with the NCCP allocated &euro;1.46 million while the NESF was allocated &euro;704,000.  At the end of August, both organisations were broadly on line to meet their expenditure.  The NESC was allocated &euro;1.923 million and it is also on line to meet this allocation.  The advantage is that all the organisations are working from a central office in Parnell Square and the administrative costs are shared.  While the organisations are still separate, carrying out their individual functions, the value is that the overheads and administration costs are collective.  There has been a good administrative saving as a result but the organisations still have separate remits.  The NESF continues to be a strategic organisation dealing with reports on the economy, social partnership and other issues while the NCCP very much works on social policy and issues identified by Oireachtas Members who are also members of the committee.  Overall, the organisations have no funding problems and operate well within budget with no pressure on their allocations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question about the National Forum on Europe, given that the Department&rsquo;s Estimate increased <Col N="1215"/>by 15% this year, will that additional money be expended?  Does the Taoiseach expect a further increase will be needed in 2007?  If so, will he outline the activity that will take place to warrant that?</P>
        <P>I refer to the allocations for the Moriarty tribunal.  The House debated a six-month extension of the tribunal previously with full rates to be paid to the lawyers involved.  Will this extension be the end of the matter?  Will the Taoiseach shed some light on the difference between the initial Estimate for the tribunal, which was expected to cost 14% less in 2006 than in 2005 and the revised Estimate in January 2006, which provided that the tribunal would cost 134% more in 2006 than in 2005?  Will he explain this huge disparity and indicate how the Estimates could be so different?  Should we believe the Estimates?  Do they have a basis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Forum on Europe received a good increase in this year&rsquo;s Estimate and it is more or less on line to meet its allocation.  We are examining next year&rsquo;s allocation but it has been upped significantly.  The forum does not have expenditure difficulties.  It is in a good position and has a good base from which to fulfil its remit and take as active a role as the forum and its members wish it to take.  I do not see a difficulty for the 2007 Estimate at this stage.</P>
        <P>To date, &euro;3.3 million has been spent by the Moriarty tribunal.  As Deputy Sargent noted, there is a total provision of &euro;8 million in this subhead, a substantial portion of which was provided to meet the payment of legal costs arising from the award of costs to parties appearing before the tribunal, should its work be completed this year.  That estimate was based on the work before the tribunal sought an extension until January.  It was intended that when the work was complete, the decisions would then be made on the legal fees, which would then have to be paid.  Whether that will happen this year, I do not know, but my Department will continue to closely monitor expenditure in the subhead.   Any savings likely to be achieved will be made available to the Department of Finance but, obviously, we will have to include them in the Estimate again next year because they will ultimately have to be paid whenever the final report is published.  There has been no change of dates with regard to the report since I last reported to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>My questions relate to those two topics.  First, there is a kind of holding piece for the McCracken tribunal.  Is it likely the tribunal&rsquo;s work will be completed or finished?  What is outstanding that requires a small reservation in the Estimates?</P><Col N="1216"/>
        <P>The Taoiseach has already answered on the Moriarty tribunal, which is the second issue I wish to raise.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s estimate as to when the bulk of that tribunal&rsquo;s report will be completed, the cost of it paid and the process closed down?</P>

	<P>The allocation for the McCracken tribunal was held over for Estimate purposes.  Very few issues remain in that regard and it is probably a subhead that will be dropped in the next round of Estimates.  The fees element of the Moriarty tribunal could go into next year.  As I understand it, the first of the reports is due sometime in the autumn.  It was originally due in the early summer but was then rescheduled for the autumn.  The second report is due early in the new year.  While I am not certain, I assume the fees elements will be dealt with in the 2007 Estimates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Together with my colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, I met the social partners on Wednesday, 14 June last at the conclusion of the negotiations on a new social partnership agreement.  The negotiations on this occasion were particularly protracted, which was perhaps a reflection of the breadth and complexity of the issues involved, and I would like again to put on record my appreciation of the considerable time and effort given by all the parties to the negotiations, and of their continued commitment, both to the immediate goal of securing a new agreement and to social partnership itself.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge at this stage that some issues remain to be settled in the discussions with the farm organisations, which are continuing.  Over the summer, the other social partner pillars have been engaged in the ratification process on Towards 2016, Ten-Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015, and I am very pleased it has received such overwhelming support in that process.  We are now focusing on the implementation of the agreement.</P>
        <P>The mechanisms for implementation are broadly the same as applied under Sustaining Progress.  The steering group representing Government and each of the social partner pillars <Col N="1218"/>will be reconvened to take overall responsibility for the management of the implementation of the ten-year framework agreement as it applies to the wider non-pay issues.  As heretofore, there will be quarterly meetings of the social partner pillars and an annual meeting of the parties with myself, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance.  It has also been agreed that a formal review will be undertaken during 2008.  My Department will contact the social partners shortly to arrange the initial steering group and plenary meetings.</P>
        <P>Work has already begun in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the comprehensive package of measures contained in the agreement on employment standards.  Initial meetings of the group on labour market trends and employment standards, the pensions review group and the anti-inflation group, all of which will be chaired by my Department, are currently being arranged.  The national implementation body, which has been in existence since 2001, is continuing to meet as required to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions in Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>The Government looks forward to working closely with employer and trade union interests in progressing the wide-ranging reform programme set out in the new agreement regarding pay, the workplace and employment rights and compliance.  I believe it will prove to be of real benefit to employers, employees and the economy more generally in the period ahead.</P>
        <P>A number of studies have been completed recently by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which will help to inform future debate and implementation of policy.  These include Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy, published in December 2004; The Developmental Welfare State, published in May 2005; the NESC Strategy 2006, People, Productivity and Purpose, published in December 2005, which was the key input to the negotiation of the new social partnership programme, Towards 2016; Migration Policy, published on 22 September 2006; and Managing Migration in Ireland: a Social and Economic Analysis, a study prepared for the NESC by the International Organisation for Migration, based in Geneva, which was also published on 22 September 2006.  Further studies nearing completion include a study on child poverty and child income supports which examines the possibility of merging child dependent allowance and family income supplement.  The NESC, along with the other bodies in the NESDO, is now embarking on the learning society exercise outlined in Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>In the coming months, the council will consider its future work programme.  The Government has also requested that the council prepare a periodic social report.  The NESC plans to undertake a study on environmental policy in its next work <Col N="1219"/>programme that will reflect on the appropriate mix of policy approaches for achieving specific environmental goals.</P>
        <P>Since its reconstitution in May 2004, the NESF has published reports on early childhood care and education, care for older people and creating a more inclusive labour market.  In addition, the NESF holds an annual national anti-poverty strategy social inclusion forum.  The third such forum was held on 15 February 2006.  The social inclusion forum gives those who are not directly involved in the social partnership process an opportunity to contribute their views and experiences to the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy.  Work is at an advanced stage on projects in respect of cultural citizenship, delivery of quality public services and mental health.</P>

	<P>In respect of the social partnership discussions, was any analysis of the impact on the economy of the immigrant labour force carried out?  What consideration has been given to a decision the Taoiseach must make in respect of opening Ireland&rsquo;s labour market to people from Romania and Bulgaria when they become members of the EU on 1 January 2007?  Is there any view on this?</P>
        <P>What consideration was given to the establishment of a consumer pillar, which was advocated by this and other parties, and an environmental pillar within the social partnership process, given that the Government has published its own Green Paper on energy, the fact that the issue of the environment has moved to a central position, the importance of this area, the impending increase in gas and electricity prices and the pressure on consumers&rsquo; quality of life?  Does the Taoiseach agree that establishing a consumer pillar in the social partnership is a practical suggestion?</P>
        <P>What analysis has been carried out on the constant and ever-increasing stream of requests and remarks from businesses telling of the pressures they face due to rising costs and inflation and the lowering of competitiveness and exports and the pressures they face in keeping their businesses above water?</P>

	<P>In respect of Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s first question, the NESC has carried out such an analysis and has produced a recent report on migration policy.  This report provides the Government with a comprehensive review of a recent experience of substantial immigration and assesses its impact on the Irish economy and society.  It makes several strategic recommendations about the policies that must be adopted if migration is to be successfully managed.  NESC&rsquo;s analysis found that the effects of migration to date have been largely positive.  While significant challenges <Col N="1220"/>remain to protect migrants from exploitation &mdash; I am sure they enjoy mobility in the Irish labour market &mdash; it concludes that migration, to date, has increased our economic growth rate and standard of living, and has widened the range of services that are available.  The report endorses the Government&rsquo;s policy on sourcing low-skilled workers from within the EU 25, while a limited level of low-skilled migration from outside the EU takes place through high quality programmes.  The analysis, which is based on extensive research, consultation and an analysis of the Council, comes to a number of high level policy recommendations of which I will mention a few.</P>
        <P>The first is the need to clarify our approach to migration, focusing on three broad goals: economic and social development, the rule of law and the integration of migrants into economic, social, cultural and civic life.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Second, the report proposes that the definition of migration policy should be extended beyond the traditional focus on channels of entry and eligibility for social services.  It should encompass a range of equally important issues, including labour market practices, social policies and policies for integration of migrants.</P>
        <P>Third, a whole Government approach to migration policy is required, supported by appropriate institutional arrangements.  This would reflect the reality that, like many other policy issues, migration cuts across a range of Departments and agencies.  The Government is already addressing some of these issues through the Employment Permits Bill and the Immigration (Residence and Protection) Bill, which is being examined.  There are a number of other proposals.  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, this is an in-depth analysis of the whole issue.  It is useful in moving towards implementing anything that is not already there, including issues of education, integration and others.</P>
        <P>A decision will have to be made on Romania and Bulgaria following the Foreign Affairs Council next week or the week after.  It is likely that they will announce the date for Bulgaria and Romania and countries will finally have to make up their minds and state their positions.  We will have to do so too.  On numerous occasions, I have said that this is a decision we will take in conjunction with the social partners and we will check with them.  I am disappointed that, to date, many countries have not opened up to the extent we have and continue to do.  Many Bulgarians and Romanians are already coming into this country as a result of the implementation of our permits legislation.  Whether we open up completely is an issue about which we need to be very careful.  We have been and continue to be good Europeans.  We can examine our approach as per the work permits if we need to open up, but we will have to discuss the matter and come to a final decision.  I am watching what other countries are doing <Col N="1221"/>also, although we have to make our own decisions.</P>
        <P>The debate on consumer issues concerns the social partners who took part in the discussions to a greater extent than others this time.  Some consumer bodies and environmental groups have applied for membership, an issue which is currently up for discussion.  Those issues are being taken into account.  The issue of competitiveness is the work of the Competitiveness Council.  That work is proposed by the employer bodies themselves as well as the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  There is plenty of focus on the issue of competitiveness and maintaining our position but in relative terms the business climate is still enormously positive.  While inflation is up, by and large due to energy issues, our productivity, growth and unit labour costs are still extremely attractive compared with any other country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that Towards 2016 was a poor deal for workers, particularly as the increases they will receive under the agreement will be quickly frittered away by inflation?  Does the Taoiseach not accept that this has already been demonstrated in the inflation figures for August that have increased to 4.5% from 4.2% in July and given that Towards 2016 offered workers 10% over 27 months which was working out at annualised increases of just 4.4%?  Will the Taoiseach accept that already the August figures demonstrate that has been surpassed?  Does he not recognise that Irish workers are already overstretched by excessive mortgages and the ever increasing cost of fuel and energy and that he has failed to do anything over the course of his tenure or to provide in Towards 2016 any measure that will seriously grapple with the ever-spiralling cost of houses, homes, for ordinary people?  Does he not accept that workers will find themselves in ever more straitened circumstances as a result of the increasing cost of housing and of energy costs, to which I have already referred?  Can he confirm that there is no mechanism in Towards 2016 to counter the effect of prolonged and increased inflation?  Why is that the case, given that previous agreements contained such a review clause and, given that if I remember correctly in 2000, the millennium year, that particular clause was invoked in response to unexpected high inflationary figures?  Will the Taoiseach agree there is no provision in Towards 2016 for an ability to pay clause in order to counter the inability to pay clause that is clearly there in the interest and protection of employers?  What is the situation applying to those employees within companies and services that are bounding ahead on the labour of those employed?  What will the Government do to protect workers in this position?  Will this be addressed by the social partners <Col N="1222"/>and will the agreement be reopened to address these very serious issues?</P>
        <P>On the point I made about rampant inflation, particularly in the area of housing, will the Taoiseach outline how he proposes to deliver the unfulfilled promise of the last agreement, which was to provide desperately needed homes and the introduction of Part V of the Planning and Development Act?  Does he recognise that the 2002 amendment of the 2000 Act allowed property developers to get off the hook regarding their responsibility to provide 20% social and affordable housing?  What does he now propose to do?  Will he restore Part V of the Act to its original intent and thereby seriously address this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two other Deputies offering, Deputies Sargent and Quinn, from whom I will hear brief questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Having listed to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply I did not hear much reference to the answer I expected to Question No. 16.  I will focus on that question given that time is limited.  The Taoiseach mentioned that he was disappointed with other countries that have not opened up their borders to the extent that Ireland has done.  Likewise, does he recognise the disappointment in other countries that Ireland is not taking as seriously as it should its responsibilities in terms of social partnership for the spiralling cost of energy?  Will he ensure that item is dealt with centrally in the partnership talks even to the extent that Sweden, which has a commission against oil dependency, has set 2020 as a deadline for cancelling its oil dependency?  Will the Taoiseach ensure that workers in social partnership are part of the changes, for example those at Eirgrid which the Green Paper or Deloitte &amp; Touche want to separate from the ESB?  Those issues need to be dealt with at partnership level if we are to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with the energy challenges facing us.  The cost of not dealing with them, the estimated &euro;1 billion for carbon trading would pay for 400 buses and a metro line.  These are real cost savings that need to be factored in if we are to get full consensus on how to get through the challenges that face us and should be as central to social partnership as, for example, in Sweden, where it is very much cross-party, cross-sectional and involves every person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the proposals on employment rights and compliance be established on an interim basis before the necessary statutory legislation necessary is brought in?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to deal with the questions quickly.  The inflation group was set up under Sustaining Progress to examine ways to bring down domestically generated inflation.  It <Col N="1223"/>comprised officials from my Department and the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as representatives from ICTU and IBEC.  Under the Towards 2016 agreement, we reconstituted the group with the same membership and mandate as before.  It is further agreed that adherence by employers and trade unionists to the pay terms of the new agreement is important from a counter-inflationary perspective.  In all of the previous agreements the pay increases worked out as beneficial to workers and that is the reason workers have overwhelmingly supported the partnership again.</P>
        <P>On housing issues, much time was given in the previous programme and this one to housing initiatives.  We have increased substantially investment in social and affordable housing and spending in this area in 2006 is four times what it was just a few years ago.  The social partnership agreement sets out an ambitious programme to deliver for the next three years, increasing the number of expected starts and acquisitions of social housing by 4,000 units to 27,000 units.  The State system of providing land sites continues.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of the number of houses.  If he looks at the figures for houses sold at below market level, he will see that under the Government&rsquo;s 1999 affordable housing scheme of 1999, 94% of all the 2005 sales under that scheme were for homes priced at &euro;185,000 or less.  The additional investments and commitments outlined in Towards 2016 testify to the importance we attach to housing affordability.  We continue to prioritise effective action to maintain high levels of supply over the period of the programme.</P>
        <P>While changes were made to the Part V initiatives, the initiatives are back with the local authorities and the Part V contribution does not constitute a way to buy out their obligation.  They must fulfil their obligations under the Act and local authorities are obliged to ensure that each agreement delivers the best possible result in terms of overall housing supply and social integration for their area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not being enforced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for each local authority.  I know the Minister talks about it from time to time, but it should be done by the local authority.  It is their role and responsibility to do it and that is clearly set out.</P>
        <P>On issues of energy, Deputy Sargent knows this issue has moved from being an issue that was not much of an issue at European Council meetings or elsewhere to being a central issue.  Working with the social partners, across Departments and in a broad national way we published our Green Paper to try to fulfil our obligations on sus<Col N="1224"/>tainability and renewable energies for the years ahead.  It is a big issue and will be a central part of the programme for all the reasons mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Quinn&rsquo;s questions, we started some months ago on the implementation arrangements and particularly on the legislative changes and measures that are required in the area set out by the Deputy.  A number of broad changes are required.  The Government has put together a unit rather than just taking the usual legislative route which would take years.  A very good unit has been established within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and it commenced work earlier this year, even before the discussions.</P>
        <P>I am unsure whether some of the issues to do with employment rights can be dealt with on an interim basis rather than on a statutory basis but it is intended to make quick progress in this area because it is an important issue for the trade unions and is one where I would like to see us making as much progress as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to a series of parliamentary questions which he asked earlier this year and in particular my reply to his written Question No. 468 of 27 June 2006.  Since then a comprehensive reply to these queries issued to him from my office on 20 September 2006.</P>
        <P>By way of background, it should be noted that the effect of a deportation order when served on a person is that the person concerned is legally obliged to leave the State and to thereafter remain out of the State.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that while section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, which is the <Col N="1225"/>relevant legislation in this area, provides for a deportation order to be made in a variety of circumstances, set out in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>i</i>) of that section, in practical terms, deportation orders tend to be made based on the provisions of section 3(2)(<i>f</i>) of the Act, that is, where the person concerned has failed all stages of the asylum process, and section 3(2)(<i>i</i>) of the Act, where the person concerned has otherwise become illegal in the State, such as where they have overstayed a work permit, a study or holiday visa or the like.  It should also be borne in mind that all deportation orders, regardless of the specified headings they are made under, are equal in value, legally and operationally.  For instance, a person who would be liable to deportation on the grounds of a prison sentence might also be liable to be deported as someone who has overstayed, and so the effect is the same.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that each case is considered on its individual merits having regard to the gravity of the offence committed as well as what, if any, other connection each individual has to the State.  For example, if a non-EU national prisoner has a legal entitlement to be in the State as a recognised refugee or as a person who has availed of EU treaty rights through marriage to an Irish or EU national, they would clearly be less likely to be deported.  Where a person has been here for some time and their children have settled here it would be necessary to consider very carefully the impact that deportation would have on the family unit.  The mere fact that somebody is a foreign national and is sent to jail in Ireland would not justify me, on the basis of proportionality, putting that person out of the country on foot of a deportation order, if I came to the view that they were the breadwinner for children who are Irish citizens or if they were married to an Irish citizen or if there were other circumstances that would make it disproportionate to deport them.</P>
        <P>My officials have identified a total of 662 non-EU national sentenced prisoners who were released from prison between 2001 and May 2006.  Computerised records are not available for 2000.  The figures I have included in the two tables cover the period from 2001 to 22 May 2006.  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, these figures have been broken down by reference to the nature of the offences in respect of which the persons concerned were convicted and subsequently imprisoned.  It should be noted that in the case of prisoners who may have committed more than one offence, the more serious offence is shown.</P>
        <P>In the context of the table, the category of &ldquo;Other&rdquo; includes persons convicted of public order and other relatively low-scale offences.  The category of &ldquo;Offences Against the Person&rdquo; includes a case where a life was lost with manslaughter being the nature of the case in question. <Col N="1226"/> The person convicted of this manslaughter was subsequently deported.  No cases of murder were involved.</P>
        <P>Of the total of 662 persons included in these records, some 252 show up as having no resident status.  This would suggest the persons concerned were either captured on official records under another alias or may be persons who had arrived illegally in the State and were never captured on official departmental records such as they might have been had they participated in the asylum, visa or work permit processes.  It could also include short-term tourists who did not require a visa but committed an offence while in Ireland.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>Of the 252 persons shown as having no resident status, the vast majority of them are included in the less serious categories of offence and it would not have been necessary to deport them on completion of their term of imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Table 2 provides an annualised picture of the non-EEA throughput from the prison system broken down by offence.</P>
        <P>While the level of deportations as outlined in Table 1 is substantial, particularly with regard to certain offences, for example drugs offences, it does not follow that all other persons referred to on the list are still residing in the State.  The reality is that many people leave the State on completion of their sentence.  Except in the most serious cases, where it is clear a person is leaving the State and highly unlikely to return, deportation will not be necessary as removal is already achieved.  The objective for the State is that the person leaves the territory and does not return.  In effect, deportation is an instrument intended to remove persons from the State who would otherwise be likely either to remain or to attempt to return.</P>
        <P>I have stated before that my Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau have an ongoing information exchange with the Irish Prison Service through which medium my Department and the GNIB are made aware of the release dates of convicted non-EU national prisoners.  This exchange has been in place for a number of years and was reviewed and further enhanced in May 2005 since which time lists of all non-EU prisoners due for release have been forwarded to the GNIB and considered for possible deportation.  Details of the offences involved are also included, as are the nationalities of the prisoners in question.  Based on this information, my Department provides information to the Irish Prison Service of the immigration status of the persons concerned and, where appropriate, prepares the paperwork necessary to have outstanding cases finalised, where possible, in advance of the planned release date.</P><Col N="1227"/>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised the issue of the exercise, or perhaps more correctly the non-exercise, by the T&aacute;naiste of a specific executive function bestowed on him by the Immigration Act 1999.  As is clear from the question, I wish to know how many serious criminals, who should at least have been considered by him or his predecessor for deportation, having served a term of imprisonment, are roaming the countryside.  The T&aacute;naiste does not appear to know and the House does not know.  The House cannot know as I raised the issue in a series of nine parliamentary questions before the recess and did not get the information.  I am not getting the information now.  Having failed to get it through the parliamentary process, I raised it by way of a freedom of information request.  I was advised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that I would have a decision by 1 September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Did it say which year? </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1228"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste might confirm that in a moment.  Finally last week I got six pages of a response to my parliamentary questions from the T&aacute;naiste.  However, they do not give replies to the questions I asked.  No amount of evasion or obfuscation will get away from the basic point of what we seek here.  I am looking for information relating to the exercise by the T&aacute;naiste of a power conferred on him by the Immigration Act 1999.  How many non-Irish nationals in each year up to 2005 were eligible to be considered for deportation pursuant to section (3)(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act?  How many of these non-Irish nationals were considered by him for deportation and how many, as of today, have been deported?  That is the information I sought last April when I first tabled these questions and the information the T&aacute;naiste has failed to furnish.</P>
        <P>He has given me information on improvements in the system, on better liaison between different bodies under his aegis from the point of view of <Col N="1229"/>keeping track on such presence.  The T&aacute;naiste might like to comment on whether the improvement in such liaison occurred at approximately the same time as the departure from office of Charles Clarke as Home Secretary in the UK because of this very issue.  One way or the other, I want to know how many such people roaming the countryside should have been considered for deportation, how many were considered and how many were deported.  Despite all the obfuscation and evasion the T&aacute;naiste has not yet furnished that information.  I ask him to do so now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course I noted that in a rather derivative way the Deputy thought that he could ask the same questions of me that Charles Clarke was asked as British Home Secretary leading to particular embarrassment for himself.  However, the Deputy should have consulted the Statute Book and realised that a very different legal position pertained in Britain in that the Judiciary there could order deportation, whereas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is central to the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is of no relevance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should stop bluffing and shouting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste answer the questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is central to the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the T&aacute;naiste do his job or not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should let me answer the question instead of just shouting.  In Britain, the Judiciary is entitled to order deportations and it transpired that the Home Office was not following up on that.  In Ireland, the Judiciary has no such power.  It can make a recommendation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; which is an entirely different matter as the Deputy well knows.  The Deputy asked for the number of non-EEA people who were prisoners at the relevant time.  Some 662 people were convicted of offences of whom 150 have been deported, a further 127 have not been deported and are legally resident in the State, the situation of a further 108 is under consideration as to whether they will be deported, 25 evaded deportation when deportation was ordered against them and may not be in the State, and the <Col N="1230"/>other category to which I referred which relates to people who have no resident status and who may or may not be in the State and are probably not in the State amounts to 252.</P>
        <P>Instead of attitudinising in a tabloid way on this matter he would be well advised to bear in mind that a non-EEA national mother of a family might have a conviction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Weep, weep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should listen to the point; his obfuscation is pathetic.  She might have a conviction in those circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not after shoplifters, as the T&aacute;naiste knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Deputy keep shouting?  He does not want to hear the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to hear answers to my question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to answer it if the Deputy will stop shouting.  The non-EEA national mother of a family with a conviction would be eligible for deportation and would fit into the figures I have supplied.  However, it would be plainly wrong to deport or even consider deporting a person in those circumstances if her husband and children were law-abiding people legally resident in the State.  Instead of trying to do a tired secondhand derivative piece of political grandstanding based on the Charles Clarke episode, which is based on different law in Britain, the Deputy would do better to study the table set out for him in the reply, come clean with the people and say there is a very significant rate of deportation of people who have served sentences in our prisons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe to be brief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s job to come clean and answer questions.  It is his job not to be evasive nor obfuscate in his replies.  I revert to the question I tabled six months ago.  How many of these people were considered by him in each of those years for deportation?  In respect of how many were deportation orders made?  The T&aacute;naiste has not yet answered the question.  The real question is why he has not answered it.  It is clear from the documentation I have received that no effective process was put in place by the T&aacute;naiste for consideration by him of these issues up to last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the next question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>In that situation, the T&aacute;naiste seems unable to tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1231"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call an t-Aire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have spent 15 minutes on this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;how many of these cases were considered by him, as it seems clear he did not consider these cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must proceed to the next question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Some very serious crimes have been committed by people who were sent to jail and were not considered by him, including a person involved in a very serious crime, who came before the Central Criminal Court in July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should finally sit down and let me answer his question.  I have given the Deputy the figures and as he well knows, 662 people would have been eligible for deportation under the relevant section, 150 were deported, 127 were not deported and are legally resident in the State and 108 are under consideration.  Therefore, 258 out of 662 have been considered or are being considered for deportation under the relevant provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>When?</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the fourth annual report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention and the report of the inspection of Cloverhill Prison, which were published by me in August 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they the most recent reports?    </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the most recent reports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Then they are the ones to which I refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The inspector&rsquo;s reports coincided with a period of profound change in the Prison Service, during which the decades long problem of dependency on excessive prison overtime was finally confronted and overcome.  As the Deputy will be aware, a situation had developed in the Prison Service whereby the capital budget and every other budget within the system were being cannibalised to fund overtime expenditure.  This reached a peak in 2003, when &euro;60 million was spent on overtime, accounting for approximately 20% of the entire prison budget.  In order to reverse this wholly unsustainable dependence on overtime, I put in place a number of measures, including major cutbacks in overtime expenditure and new attendance arrangements.  These measures led to cuts, for necessary operational <Col N="1233"/>reasons, in services to prisoners in the period covered by the inspector&rsquo;s reports.</P>
        <P>Following prolonged negotiations, the POA in August 2005 accepted a proposal to eliminate overtime work and introduce new organisational and working arrangements which will provide long-term savings to the Exchequer of up to &euro;25 million per annum.  These new arrangements will not only restore, but also enhance prisoner regimes in the years ahead, particularly in terms of improving access to services, increasing the availability of better facilities and making more productive use of out-of-cell time for prisoners.  In this regard, much progress has been made over the past 12 months in improving educational and workshop facilities for prisoners.</P>
        <P>In St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, the refurbishment of five workshops will lead to FETAC accreditation in metalwork, woodwork, computers, industrial cleaning and other industrial skills.  The new workshops will give constructive activity to over 70 inmates and their roll-out is almost complete.  The refurbishment of Cloverhill Education Centre has recently been completed.  Classes have now commenced and courses are being rolled out on a phased basis.  In short, the circumstances adverted to by the inspector arose because the overtime dispute reached a crisis, but huge improvements have since been made.</P>
        <P>The fourth annual report of the inspector covers the period from April 2005 to April 2006 and deals with a wide range of issues including staffing levels, the establishment of an inspector of prisons on a statutory footing, prisoners&rsquo; rights to vote, the privatisation of prisons, recidivism, drug addiction and prisoners with psychiatric illnesses.  In respect of shortcomings in conditions, the inspector called in his report for the immediate closure of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  The lack of modern facilities at that institution has been the subject of justified criticism not only by the Inspector of Prisons, but also by other oversight and monitoring bodies.</P>
        <P>The Government shares the view that St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is no longer suitable as a place of detention for young people and that its complete replacement is required.  The institution, together with other detention facilities on the Mountjoy Prison complex, will be closed as soon as planned new facilities are constructed on a greenfield site at Thornton Hall, County Dublin, where separate facilities will be available for 16 and 17 year old boys.  The new campus will allow us to develop progressive rehabilitative programmes and enhanced educational facilities and introduce single occupancy cells with in-cell sanitation to end the practice of slopping out.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of House.</i></P>
        <P>The development of the new prison campus will also provide the Prison Service with room for future expansion and ensure there will be no <Col N="1234"/>return to the revolving door of the mid-1990s, when the rainbow Government presided over a situation in which 20% of prisoners were on temporary release.  By way of comparison, on 28 September 2006, there were 3,314 persons in the prison system, of whom 156, or 4.7%, were on temporary release.  The reason for the significant reduction in the percentage of prisoners on temporary release between 1996 and 2006 is because the Government has provided some 1,100 net additional prison spaces since 1997.   In addition, over 400 new places are being created at Shelton Abbey, Loughan House, Castlerea, Portlaoise and Wheatfield Prisons.</P>
        <P>The inspector also calls for the elimination of drugs in prisons and the introduction of sniffer dogs in prisons such as Mountjoy.  As the Deputy is aware, the elimination of drugs in our prisons is one of my key priorities.  In order to achieve this, a drug detection dog was introduced into the prison system earlier this year.  The service is based in the Midlands Prison and it is planned that trials will be carried out from that base.  The initial phase is being used to test the effectiveness of drug dogs in prisons and to act as a learning exercise for the Prison Service to refine its precise approach in a wider deployment.  The pilot has proved extremely successful to date and the dog has detected significant numbers of smuggling attempts.  It is intended that the drug detection dog will be used in Mountjoy in the near future.</P>
        <P>However, drug detection dogs are just one of a much wider range of measures contained in the new Prison Service drugs policy and strategy, which I launched earlier this year.  The new policy and strategy provides, for the first time, a co-ordinated and consistent national approach to dealing with the thorny problem of supply of drugs, as well as ensuring appropriate treatment is available to prisoners to help them conquer their addictions.  The policy is currently being rolled out across the prison system.  The new replacement Mountjoy and Munster prison complexes will be constructed with an extensive perimeter to prevent drugs being thrown over the wall and will thus facilitate drug-free regimes.</P>
        <P>In terms of prisoners with psychiatric illnesses, the inspector expressed concern regarding the treatment of mentally ill prisoners and prisoners with personality disorders and recommended the Department of Health and Children should take responsibility for such prisoners.  The Irish Prison Service is committed to health care standards comparable to those obtaining in the wider community.  Prisoners have access to medical, nursing, psychiatric and psychological services within the prison system and the psychiatric needs of prisoners are served by visiting psychiatrists.  The psychiatric service of the eastern coast area health board at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, which is under the management of the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, provides regular weekly counselling and <Col N="1235"/>treatment sessions at Dublin prisons.  In other locations, services are provided by local psychiatrists.</P>
        <P>Offenders who, in the opinion of the psychiatrist and the prison doctor, are in need of inpatient psychiatric treatment may be transferred by order to either the Central Mental Hospital or a district mental hospital.  However, the Central Mental Hospital is the only psychiatric inpatient hospital that will accept prisoners.  Due to increased demand on this facility in recent years, it has frequently been the situation that waiting lists build up for admission, requiring priority to be based on clinical need.  This situation arises despite the general agreement regarding the necessity for admission and, while awaiting a bed to become available, the prison authorities may be left with no alternative but to seek to manage a disturbed individual in conditions which provide the greatest degree of protection for the individual, other prisoners and staff.  My Department and the Prison Service is continually engaged with the Department of Health and Children and the HSE in a process aimed at co-ordinating the provision of health care to prisoners.</P>
        <P>I have honoured my commitment to abolish the use of old-style padded cells by introducing newly designed and improved cells.  Special observation cells are not used for routine reasons but only in cases where prisoners are in a highly agitated state and at risk of harming themselves or others.  No mentally ill prisoner awaiting a move to the Central Mental Hospital is detained in a special cell unless this is unavoidable.  Such a practice is not commonplace but takes place only where the safety of prisoners require it.</P>
        <P>I have appointed Mr. Mellet to carry out an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Mr. Gary Douch while in custody in Mountjoy Prison, which will establish what action was taken by the Prison Service, management and staff to safeguard Mr. Douch; to clarify whether Mr. Douch had expressed special concerns about his safety; to establish what procedures were followed and their adequacy; to establish the procedures used to allocate prisoners to the cell in which Mr. Douch died; to establish the level of monitoring during the night of 31 July to 1 August 2006; and to make any observations and recommendations Mr. Mellet sees fit.  I intend that the report by Mr. Mellet will be published in due course, with the exception of any parts which could be deemed prejudicial to potential criminal proceedings.</P>
        <P>I have not received yet Mr. Mellet&rsquo;s report.  He has, however, already made a valuable interim recommendation that, where a prisoner seeks specific protection because of an alleged threat from another prisoner and the prison authorities accept there may be some substance to the allegation, the prisoner should be removed to a single <Col N="1236"/>occupancy cell or room for at least 24 hours while the case is assessed.  This recommendation has been accepted by me and was implemented immediately by the prison authorities.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on his first occasion to take parliamentary questions in his new office and wish him well for however long he occupies that important position.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept he made an extraordinary admission when he said the conditions outlined in the Kinlen report were allowed to happen because budgets were being cannibalised to pay for overtime?  As Minister, he allowed a situation to arise where, for example, parts of Mountjoy were being sprayed twice a week to keep mice and cockroaches at bay.  Overcrowding was such that an individual who asked for protection was brutally murdered after being put in a cell with six other prisoners, including one who had recently arrived from the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
        <P>The violence in Mountjoy over the summer, which included two deaths in 12 hours and four stabbings in three weeks, was allowed to take place.  Does the Minister think it is acceptable to tell the House that he has resolved an overtime issue and, therefore, the horror stories which had been laid out in graphic and unimaginable terms in the Kinlen report were allowed because budgets were being cannibalised?</P>
        <P>Has the Minister received the findings of the independent inquiry by former senior official, Mr. Michael Mellet, into the dreadful murder of Gary Douch and what are the main recommendations contained therein?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Howlin for his kind words of congratulation.  The remainder of my answer to his question, which I was unable to read on the floor of the House, addressed the issues raised by the Deputy.  However, as the answer has been put on the record, I will give the Deputy only a summary of its contents.</P>
        <P>I agree that the death of Gary Douch was an appalling event and the circumstances in which he died are not defensible.  For that reason, I asked Mr. Michael Mellet, who was secretary to the International Monitoring Commission and a former Secretary General in my Department, to compile a full report.  He is currently examining a number of issues, while awaiting the pathologist&rsquo;s report and information on the decisions made in the Central Mental Hospital which resulted in the transfer of the apparent assailant to the prison system subsequent to his committal to the hospital.  These issues are of the utmost gravity and ones which I regard as requiring a substantial explanation.  I will take appropriate action to ensure that such events never recur.</P>
        <P>It had been my understanding that holding cells were used to hold prisoners on committal from courts when there was insufficient time to process <Col N="1237"/>them.  One of the immediate steps taken was to appoint the Midlands, Cork and Wheatfield Prisons as committal prisons in addition to Mountjoy.  The purpose of that change was to reduce the pressure on Mountjoy but, as it turns out, a number of people in that holding cell appeared not to have come from the court system and should not have been in those circumstances.  In my view, there is no excuse for keeping them in those circumstances.  The holding cells in question have been closed and are being converted to other uses.  The number of prisoners in Mountjoy has been reduced and two areas which had previously been mothballed, A2 and A3, are being brought back into service.</P>
        <P>I was shown a haul of weapons, including some brutal implements, which were recently found in Mountjoy after a search arising from one of the incidents in question.  These weapons are regularly catapulted into the exercise yards, with the result that new fencing and other arrangements are being put in place to prevent the smuggling of drugs and weapons.  New screening provisions are being introduced for prisoners.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy, the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention and I are correct in calling for the closure and replacement of Mountjoy.  It is an unsuitable prison and is incapable of acting as a place of rehabilitation and detention for sentenced persons.  That is why the replacement of the Mountjoy complex is a priority for me and I will go ahead with that project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the belated acceptance by the Minister that the conditions in Mountjoy remain appalling.  He indicated he has not yet received a copy of Mr. Mellet&rsquo;s report.  Presumably, inmates continue to arrive at Mountjoy, including some with mental health difficulties.  What particular steps have been taken by the Minister since the murder of Gary Douch with regard to enforcement or renewal of protocols to deal with prisoners who have psychiatric problems, are dangerous or are sick?  What has the Minister done since the appalling death of Gary Douch to ensure prisoners are never again put at that type of risk?  Is he satisfied that mentally ill people are incarcerated in the normal prison system?  What is he doing to ensure that appropriate treatment is given to people who are inappropriately incarcerated at present?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to mentally ill people, when I was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform there was a system of using padded cells.  These cells were so appalling to even the most casual and inexperienced visitor as to require their immediate replacement.  I have got rid of the padded cells and have replaced them with modern state-of-the-art observation cells, where people are held in humane circumstances.  They were not being held in humane circumstances in padded cells.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1238"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Should they be in prison at all?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked what has happened since the death of Gary Douch.  Mr. Mellet reported to me on an interim basis within days of his appointment that no prisoner who sought protection should be put in those circumstances.  The practice was immediately prohibited within the Prison Service by way of an interim recommendation from Mr. Mellet.</P>
        <P>With regard to psychiatrically ill prisoners, what is happening at present is wholly inadequate.  The relationship between the Prison Service and the Central Mental Hospital is inadequate and, in some respects, indefensible.  The Central Mental Hospital should act as a forensic psychiatric institution to serve people who need hospital treatment for psychiatric conditions and who are committed to the State&rsquo;s custody.  It should not be the case, as has occurred in the past, that some people are returned to the Prison Service from Dundrum on the basis that they are too difficult to handle.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it still the state of affairs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It has happened in the relatively recent past.  That is not acceptable.  If somebody is a danger to himself or others, the Central Mental Hospital must be organised on the basis that it can adequately deal with such a person.  It must have sufficient rooms to accommodate all the people who are properly committed by prison doctors to that hospital for treatment, where they can be humanely and decently dealt with.</P>
        <P>That is why I am determined to have the Dundrum complex, which is old and out of date, replaced by a modern, forensic psychiatric institution in close proximity to the new prison campus at Thornton.  It is not acceptable that psychiatrically ill prisoners are shuttled between two institutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is happening today.</P>

        <QRef>[31021/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2002, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, established the Office of Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention on a non-statutory basis.  In 2005, I examined the possibility of providing a statutory basis for the office by means of a statutory instrument, namely, to provide for the office in the prison rules which are at an advanced stage of preparation and are on the Department&rsquo;s website.  However, after consultation with the Attorney General, I came to the conclusion that there should be provision for such an office in primary legislation.</P>
        <P>In July this year, the Government approved my proposal to establish an Office of Inspector of Prisons on a statutory basis.  I will introduce an appropriate statutory provision by means of an amendment to the Prisons Bill 2005, which is before the Seanad at present.  I hope that the Bill, as amended, will be enacted before Christmas of this year so the statutory office can be established in 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister well in his position as T&aacute;naiste.  He has been Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for four years and four months but we have yet to see legislation to put the office of prison inspector on a statutory basis.  All I have seen is media speculation.  If the will was there, the Minister could have moved more quickly on this.  Is he giving a commitment that an independent inspectorate will be put in place before Christmas?  Will he make the same mistake that he made with the Garda Ombudsman Commission, whereby the staff will not be independent but will be seconded from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Does the Minister not agree it is crucial that the prison inspectorate is completely independent of the Department and the Prison Service?</P>
        <P>The Minister appears to be more interested in Ceaucescu-like projects for super prisons in north Dublin than in systematic reform of the prison system and how it works.  The test of any society is not how it treats the most well-off but how it treats its most wretched citizens.  In three reports the Committee for the Prevention of Torture has urged the Minister to provide an independent inspectorate.  We had an independent prison inspectorate 180 years ago in the 1820s.  When will the Minister move on this?  Will the proposed inspectorate be truly independent so it can give testimony to actual conditions in the prisons without fear or favour?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1240"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Prisons Bill is before the Seanad and if the Deputy consults the proceedings of that House, he can confirm that.  The decision was made in July this year to provide in that Bill for a statutory basis for the inspector&rsquo;s job.  The amendments will be put down shortly in the Seanad and the Deputy will have an opportunity to debate them in this House and in the justice committee before Christmas.</P>
        <P>The inspector is most certainly independent.  Any reader of his reports will know they are not written by me or to please me or at my dictation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has delayed their publication.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>He said the Minister was outrageous and practically unbelievable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s priority question.  I will deal with Deputy Howlin later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is something to look forward to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I defy anybody to claim the inspector is not independent.  The Deputy made a throw-away remark that the staff of the Garda Ombudsman Commission are not independent.  That is wholly untrue.  They are not seconded members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The commission is currently recruiting its staff and it is not, in any sense, lacking independence.  It is just as independent as Nuala O&rsquo;Loan is in Northern Ireland.  The commission is recruiting its staff independently of me and will have a wholly independent structure.  It will not be dictated to by my Department.</P>
        <P>The former judge, Dermot Kinlen, is an independent man.  He has access to prisons.  I intend to provide for a statutory basis for the Office of Inspector of Prisons.  I do not agree with everything in his reports, and readers of the reports could not conclude that he is dependent on or beholden to me or is trammelled in what he says and does by any consideration of a lack of independence from me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My recollection is that the Bill providing for the Garda Ombudsman Commission allows staff to be seconded from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That has the potential to severely compromise it in carrying out its duties.  I accept the inspector of prisons is independent but his report goes to the Minister.  Its publication has been delayed by the Minister&rsquo;s Department, so it is not truly independent.  I accept that the tone and tenor of some of the remarks in his reports would suggest he is completely independent but I won<Col N="1241"/>der what he would say if he was completely independent given that he described the Minister as outrageous and with Fascist tendencies in his reports which were scrutinised by the Minister before publication.  </P>

        <P>To be deadly serious, under the Minister&rsquo;s watch, prison programmes, such as the CONNECT programme and programmes which address recidivism, illiteracy and addiction, have been severely cut.  Can the Minister give a commitment that a prisons inspectorate will be completely independent, will be able to publish its own reports and will be able to reveal what actually goes on inside our prisons without having to have its reports vetted by the Minister prior to publication?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It was not a question of me vetting the report but of me reading it and seeing a number of passages in it which I concluded might be defamatory.  I submitted them to counsel to decide whether they were publishable by me without risk of me being sued.  I was advised by counsel and the Attorney General that I could not publish the report in the form in which it was.  I asked that the passages be deleted from the report.  The inspector and I eventually agreed on a process whereby the report would be published without those provisions.  I did not want to edit him and I sent the report back to him.  He is a senior counsel and a judge and I thought he would be in a position to render it publishable without risk of defamation but, in the end, it fell to somebody else to carry that out.</P>
        <P>The reports, in so far as it is lawful to publish them, will be and have been published.  If I was in the slightest way given to censorship of what was in the reports, all the remarks to which Deputy Howlin and Deputy Cuffe referred, would not appear.  Therefore, it cannot be said that I have attempted to censor them in any way, nor would I do so.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will appreciate that the Prison Service now has considerably increased accommodation compared with the situation in 1997.  All the rehabilitative facilities and programmes were under massive threat as long as the prison budget was being cannibalised by overtime.  I tackled that situation, and I am the first Minister for Justice in 20 or 30 years to do so.  There is now a sound financial basis in the Prison Service to improve and sustain all those services.</P>

        <QRef>[30828/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On 28 September 2006 there were 3,158 persons in prison custody as compared with a bed capacity of 3,383.  This represents an occupancy level of 93%.  It is my view, supported by these figures, that there is no overcrowding crisis or immediate issue relating to the capacity of the prison system.  There is, however, a need to upgrade existing prison accommodation and to plan for the future and I am advancing a number of projects at present to that end.</P>
        <P>This Government, which took office in July 1997, inherited a prison system virtually in a state of collapse.  In mid-term the outgoing Government in an infamous decision had actually cancelled planned building projects at Castlerea and the women&rsquo;s prison at Mountjoy.  The situation was so bad that the revolving door syndrome was in danger of forever discrediting the entire Irish criminal justice process.  Furthermore, nothing had been done to even plan to refurbish Mountjoy Prison, which was even then in a deplorable state.</P>
        <P>To illustrate the scale of the problem we inherited, the proportion of prisoners on temporary release on 9 December 1996 stood at 552, a figure equating to 20% of the total prison population.  This compares with a current figure of 156 persons, or under 5% of the prison population.  The actual number of prisoners in custody on 9 December 1996 stood at 2,230 with a bed capacity for 2,251, an occupancy level of 99%.  Mountjoy Prison had 640 prisoners within its walls which is a figure 40% higher than the current population of 454.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware of the provision of approximately 1,300 new prison spaces in recent years at considerable cost, which has put the Irish Prison Service in a much better position to accommodate prisoners for the duration of their sentences than was the case in the mid-1990s.  This programme has resulted in the building of new prisons such as Cloverhill, Castlerea, the Midlands and the new women&rsquo;s prison at Mountjoy alongside additional accommodation in Limerick and Loughan House.  Further accommodation is at an advanced stage of construction at Portlaoise Prison, Casterea Prison, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey and new prison estates are being planned for Thornton Hall and Spike Island.</P>
        <P>It is a bit much for the Deputy to ask about a current overcrowding problem and a crisis within the prison system when the Government he supported in 1997 left the system in a state.  In regard to Fort Mitchel and the Curragh, the number of spaces provided in the lifetime of this Government far outweighs the number of places lost at that point.</P><Col N="1243"/>
     <?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>I also refer the Deputy to my response to his colleague, Deputy Durkan, in Question No. 167 answered on 5 May 2004 in which I advised that:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">any shortage of prison spaces is not as a direct result of the forced mothballing of the places of detention at Fort Mitchel and the Curragh.  Overall these two institutions had a capacity of 204 spaces (102 each).  The recent opening of a new wing in Limerick Prison has fully offset the loss of Fort Mitchel. The lost capacity in the case of the Curragh Place of Detention, has been approximately 80% offset by the bringing into operation of previously unused spaces in the Midlands Prison.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is therefore disingenuous to assert that the closing of these places of detention has in some way contributed to an overcrowding crisis.  Suggestions to this effect are completely misleading and irresponsible.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, I accept that a number of our prisons remain in a poor state, particularly Mountjoy and Cork prisons.  This is being remedied by constructing new campuses in Dublin and Munster.  The new facilities will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work training, education and medical services as well as providing predominantly single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation facilities.  These are major undertakings involving replacement of close to 40% of the entire prison estate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy seems to be suggesting that the &euro;29.9 million paid for the 150 acres at Thornton is &euro;15 million too much.  Is this the same Deputy who was reported by <i>The Irish Times</i> in July 2005 as saying that a five acre plot of land in the same townland at Thornton Hall itself but not purchased by the State, is worth &euro;1 million an acre?</P>
        <P>I am quite satisfied that the purchase of 150 acres of land at Thornton for approximately &euro;200,000 an acre was an excellent long-term investment for the State and is not out of line with prices being paid by private developers.  This view is not only supported by experts employed by the State but also by independent sources.  A local auctioneer interviewed by RTE Radio 1 stated that he had disposed of land for between &euro;125,000 and &euro;175,000 an acre and that he doubted if anyone could identify a parcel of 150 acres of land within ten miles of O&rsquo;Connell Street for less than &euro;30 million.  One can still obtain some parcels of land in north county Dublin on the scale envisaged at Thornton for a cheaper price but not land suitable for a prison.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2005 report suggests that if a less open, third party approach was used it might have been possible to acquire suitable land at a lower price.  That it his view, however, my Department&rsquo;s Secretary General, the Accounting Officer, had, for <Col N="1244"/>good reasons extreme reservations about using a covert and secret third party approach to purchasing land for this project.  I shared his reservations in this regard.  The Accounting Officer had administrative oversight of the acquisition process throughout, put in place in respect of the purchase of Thornton.  He looks forward to further clarifying the matter when he gives evidence before the forthcoming meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on this topic.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister living in a different world from the rest of us?  Was he around during the month of August when there were dreadful happenings in our prisons?  Was he even aware of the appalling overcrowding in Mountjoy or of the spate of assaults, stabbings and so on resulting from it?  Was he aware a prisoner was killed in that prison largely as a result of the overcrowding because his request for help could not be accommodated?  </P>
        <P>Is the Minister not aware that a major contribution to the overcrowding problem is that he took a number of prisons and institutions out of commission without providing immediate alternative accommodation?  I refer to Spike Island, the Curragh and, if I recollect correctly, Shanganagh.  Does he not realise that the crisis which developed in our prisons resulted largely from overcrowding and that anybody to whom one talks in the Irish Prison Service will confirm that?  During whatever time is left to him in office, does he have plans to relieve that overcrowding?</P>
        <P>I refer to the long-term plans in regard to the Thornton Hall farm which, at &euro;200,000 per acre, is labelled the dearest farm in Europe.  Is the Minister not in any way concerned that the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report is a shocking confirmation of the Minister&rsquo;s spendthrift approach as far as taxpayers&rsquo; money is concerned?  There is no planning and zoning for the farm, the agricultural value of which is probably &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million.  The Comptroller and Auditor General gives the Minister some solace by saying it could be worth &euro;15 million because of hope value, yet he paid &euro;30 million for it with &euro;15 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money wasted.  He is the leader of a party which, at one stage, prided itself on having some care and concern about taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Does he have an answer to that accusation in light of the independent criticism of the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, I do not know if he was having a quiet snooze but I dealt with the deaths and weapons in Mountjoy and all the issues approximately five minutes ago.</P>
        <P>I would like to make a couple of points about Thornton Hall.  The Deputy will be aware that the Committee of Public Accounts will examine that issue this month.  I am confident the Accounting Officer of my Department, the Secretary General, Mr. Sean Aylward, will go before that <Col N="1245"/>committee and will fully establish a few simple propositions.  First, the land is of the value spent on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not like to try to sell it.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Second, nobody is in a position to point to any land suitable for a prison at that distance from or nearer to the city of Dublin which has sold or changed hands for a lesser price.  Third, the Comptroller and Auditor General did not say &euro;15 million was wasted.  He said &mdash; let us be clear about it &mdash; that if I had agreed to secretly buy the land and not disclose the purpose for which I was purchasing it, to wait for an auction to take place and to spring this on some community without giving any consideration to what land was available and if I was to do a furtive purchase in those circumstances, I could have bought land in north Dublin for &euro;100,000.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister slipped it through overnight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what he said.  The Deputy will appreciate that what happened was that the Accounting Officer of my Department came to the conclusion that it would be ethically wrong to send people out to farms that became available without having a fully transparent, advertised process seeking appropriate land for the purpose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The deal was done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>All of these matters will be thrashed out before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am confident that the decisions made by the committee in question, which was composed of senior public servants, including one of the commissioners of the Office of Public Works, on the basis of an approach which was devised by the Accounting Officer of my Department, will stand up to any scrutiny.  I again finish with this question; can anybody show me any land the same or a lesser distance as Thornton Hall from O&rsquo;Connell Bridge, which has changed hands for less than &euro;200,000 per acre in the past two years?  One will not find it because it has not happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister put up the price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the case again that everybody is out of step but the Minister?  Does everybody not agree that it was a disgraceful waste of public money?  Does everybody not also agree with the headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> that it was an expensive blunder?  The Minister referred to consultation.  There was no consultation.  Does the Minister not accept that this farm did not emerge from the original process and that the <Col N="1246"/>entire transaction was slipped through almost in the dark of night, that it took place in a matter of seven days, that there was no local public consultation and that in regard to comparative values, a farm within a couple of kilometres of the farm in question was sold two months later for &euro;26,000 an acre, which would have been far more suitable for a prison?</P>
        <P>The Minister spent &euro;30 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money and he still tries to justify it.  Does the Minister not accept that if somebody were starting a sweetshop he would not put him in as manager because his business expertise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No land which was suitable for a prison was sold for the prices in question closer to or the same distance from the city of Dublin.  The second matter about which I remind Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe relates to his own auctioneering tendencies.  It is interesting to note that in July 2005 he stated that five acres of the Thornton Hall farm which was kept back by the vendor was worth &euro;1 million per acre and he gave out to me for missing that opportunity.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of the acquisition of a prison site at Thornton Hall was included in the 2005 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General at the request of the Committee of Public Accounts and will be examined by it in October.  The relevant officials from my Department will be present to account in detail to the Committee of Public Accounts on all the issues raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>The Committee of Public Accounts is the proper forum to address these matters and I am reluctant to show any lack of respect to that committee by trying to anticipate or pre-empt its examination.  However, I have to note that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not state that too much was paid for Thornton Hall.  Rather, to quote his main conclusion, he states that &ldquo;a well-managed, third party approach might have allowed the Prison Service to procure suit<Col N="1248"/>able land at a much lower price than was paid for the land at Thornton&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear that in this context a &ldquo;third party approach&rdquo; means that a site would be acquired in secret.  No one would be told that the State was involved or that land was being sought for the most significant penal development in the history of the State.  There would have been no public advertisement, no information given in D&aacute;il answers and a very restricted assessment process.</P>
        <P>The Accounting Officer of my Department has already gone on record stating that in the light of the nature of this particular project and to ensure proper accountability, a deliberate and principled decision was taken not to use a third party, furtive, acquire by stealth approach.  The strategic, moral and practical reasons for that decision are outlined in the report and have not been contradicted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>While there is a passing reference to compulsory purchase order mechanisms in the report, the Comptroller and Auditor General is aware that there is no provision for the acquisition of a prison site like Thornton Hall by compulsory purchase order.  I do not have the power to look at a map, say that site would suit and go to the present occupant of it and ask him or her to hand over his or her property to me.</P>
        <P>The report does state that there are some &ldquo;apparent&rdquo; inconsistencies in the evaluations of the site.  That issue and issues relating to surveys, costing and site size will be fully addressed by the relevant officials at the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, I can say at this point that my Department&rsquo;s Accounting Officer is satisfied that it would not have been possible to obtain a site as suitable as Thornton Hall for any less than was paid.  The information available to me is that no site of comparable quality and suitability closer to Dublin has changed hands in recent times for less per acre than was paid for the Thornton Hall site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am still of the belief that this deal stinks to high heaven.  I asked questions at the time and I will continue to ask them.  It is strange that we will deal with the issue at the Committee of Public Accounts, but that is after the fact, and that when these questions first arose the deal had not been completed.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that the propaganda document which his Department issued entitled, New Dublin Prison Complex, The Right Decision?, states that each site was assessed on the basis of a marking matrix addressing all the essential criteria and on the basis of this objective marking system, the least expensive, most suitable site was selected?  Is the Minister further aware that the Comptroller and Auditor&rsquo;s General&rsquo;s report stated that the committee did not record the basis on which the scores were awarded to individual sites under the various <Col N="1249"/>criteria and the marks awarded by the site selection committee appeared to be inconsistent?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report stated that the site selection committee dropped the criteria after receiving a letter from the director general of the Prison Service in September 2004 and that from then on the matter of cost was not a consideration?  How does the Minister reconcile the assertion contained in his document with the facts established by the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that his document states that at less than &euro;200,000 per acre the site at Thornton Hall represents good value while the Comptroller and Auditor General found that the purchase did not represent good value?  We have already gone through those points.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that the price paid for the site at Thornton was likely to have been at least twice the market value at the time for well positioned agricultural land with development potential in the target area.  Is the Minister aware of a trawl of similar sites in the near vicinity, one of which was sold in March of last year for &euro;26,000 per acre but a number of those other sites which were being considered by the committee had a lesser price tag?  How does all of this square up other than to give rise to major questions about the purchase of this site and the dodgy deal that appears to have been done in the last days of that committee despite the fact that this site was not part of the original tendering process, appeared out of nowhere and then was given the significant amounts mentioned by the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the suggestions that this was a dodgy deal and stinks in any way and that the committee, comprising senior public servants, acted improperly.  It is unworthy to suggest that about them without knowing any of the basic facts.</P>
        <P>This acquisition will be fully investigated by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Accounting Officer and Secretary General of my Department, the director general of the Prison Service and the Commissioner of Public Works, who was involved in the acquisition, will fully defend their actions and will not be found to have been wanting.  At one stage, the valuers who advised the Comptroller and Auditor General in his study came up with a comparator of agricultural land, but there was a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; problem in that it was located in Ardee, County Louth.  This was one of the comparators used in their analysis of the situation.</P>
        <P>I stand by the material that I have put into the public domain and the integrity of the officials who purchased the property.  If I had gone to auctions, pretended not to be the State purchasing land for a prison and operated by stealth, Deputies would have been the first to ask why I <Col N="1250"/>did not advertise for suitable spaces or ask the landowners of north County Dublin whether there were more suitable places than the land bought.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to a number of other properties considered by the committee, but he should know that some of them which were further from Dublin and had been zoned as agricultural have sold for more than &euro;200,000 per acre.  The closest adjacent property considered by the committee, which was adjacent to the motorway, would only have been available at a significantly higher price.</P>
        <P>If anyone can point to a parcel of 150 acres that distance from O&rsquo;Connell Street which has changed hands for less than &euro;200,000 per acre in recent years, please do so.  No one has come up with such an example.</P>

	<P>In July of this year, I received Government approval for a number of proposals to strengthen and support the senior management structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Among the measures approved by the Government was the establishment of a four-person advisory group chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes. The other members of the group are Ms Emer Daly, former director of strategic planning and risk management with Axa Insurance; Dr. Michael Mulraney, assistant director general of the Institute of Public Administration; and Mr. Maurice Keane, former group chief executive of the Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I envisage that the advisory group will have a lifespan of approximately 12 months.  Its primary objective will be to advise and support the Garda Commissioner and his senior management team in addressing the leadership and management challenges currently facing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the context of responding to the deficiencies in those areas identified by the Morris tribunal.  In particular, the group will advise the Garda Commissioner and his senior management team on the development of strong management and leadership skills at all management grades in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the promotion within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a culture of performance management and accountability within the framework of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005; the continued development of human resource management, including the development of succession planning at senior levels to ensure continuity of management and oversight; the development of specialist skills throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through enhanced training of garda&iacute;; and accelerated direct recruitment of civilians with such expertise and the enhancement of the provision of training for members and staff of the force.</P>
        <P>This group, which has a unique set of skills and insights, will be a key support for the Garda Commissioner and his management team in implementing the comprehensive reform agenda now underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Its members will bring strong management and leadership experience and expertise to this task.  Their work will complement the activities of the Garda inspectorate, the main focus of which will be on benchmarking, by reference to international experience, generic Garda operational procedures and practices.</P>

	<P>One of the Garda management advisory group&rsquo;s terms of reference is to promote a culture of accountability.  How does the Minister envisage this might be done?  What is his reaction to the reaction of the Garda representative bodies to the publication of the most recent Morris tribunal reports and the commencement of training of the first members of the Garda reserve?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1252"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly deprecate and reject the reported remarks attributed to the secretary general of the Garda Representative Association concerning the way in which members of the reserve will be regarded.  I have asked the Commissioner for a full report in respect of those remarks so that appropriate action can be taken.</P>
        <P>Regarding the reaction to the Morris tribunal reports, the House will have an opportunity in the coming weeks to consider the three reports that have not yet been considered, the Barr tribunal report and the report of the Nally group into the Garda Sergeant White affair in respect of Omagh.  The House will also have an opportunity to consider the recent report into the Dean Lyons issue prepared by George Birmingham, SC.</P>

	<P>The order before us is only 45 minutes old.  We asked the Government last week for time to debate these matters and it refused.  The Government came around to a position of offering a paltry 35 minutes in its entirety.  The haggling has gone on for the week and 45 minutes before we come into the House, we find the order provides for the Taoiseach to make a statement for 15 minutes but that the rest of us will only have five minutes.  That is inequitable.</P>
        <P>The total provision of 45 minutes is entirely inadequate.  We required in these circumstances a question and answer facility that is adequate to the gravity of the matter before us.  The provision for questions and answers is minimalist, and is even less than was provided by this Taoiseach when last we had a situation like this &mdash; concerning former Deputy Ray Burke.  It is inadequate, but because of the interest outside the House I do not want to divide the House on it.  When the T&aacute;naiste stated he would enforce accountability, it is important to record that the contents of this order do not amount to adequate accountability in these circumstances.</P>

	<P>Neither do I want to divide the House on this, but it is important we understand the order and can all work by it in an equitable way.  My party is not dealing with Leaders&rsquo; Questions today; we will be tomorrow.  I ask that today, in the question and answer session, that fact would be respected.  Sinn F&eacute;in may feel similarly.  There is considerable interest in this and the <Col N="1255"/>number of people here indicates that.  It would be appropriate, fair and equitable if, early on, the Ceann Comhairle would allow questions from parties not represented on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  Could the Ceann Comhairle give that undertaking?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the discharge of my public duties, the interests of the Irish people have always taken precedence over everything else.  I believe the Irish people recognise that this is so.  Over the past week, I have encountered people in different parts of the country and I have been touched by their sense of balance about this issue and their innate common decency about the personal dilemma that I had during 1993 and 1994.</P>
        <P>Last week I put on the record of the House a number of the allegations that have been made against me at the tribunals.  Each and every one of these charges is baseless.  They are false and are no more than a tissue of lies.  However, these allegations were made and the tribunal is required to investigate them in so far as they fall within its terms of reference.  It is in this context that I have been co-operating with the tribunal and will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>Those who have made up these allegations have gone to extraordinary lengths to set me up.  For example, a forged letter, purporting to show that I had taken steps to open a bank account in Mauritius, was sent to the Moriarty tribunal.  I can <Col N="1256"/>confirm that correspondence was subsequently forwarded to the tribunal which demonstrates the letter to be a forgery.  I am placing these documents in the Library.</P>
        <P>In order to assist the tribunal with the inquiries into some of the lurid allegations made against me, I gave all my bank and financial records to the tribunals for the years they requested.  I produced all of my records going back for a long number of years which show I have not enriched myself through politics and have not abused public office.</P>
        <P>I disclosed my financial records to the tribunal and it is deeply regrettable that these confidential records appeared in a newspaper.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that arising from financial pressures I encountered at the time of my separation, a number of my friends decided to come to my assistance.  The loans I received from my friends totalled &pound;39,000, that is, &pound;22,500 plus &pound;16,500.  I wish to confirm to the House that on Friday I repaid each one of these loans with compound interest calculated at 5% per annum, and at a total cost of &euro;90,867.</P>
        <P>In my interview with RT&Eacute; last week, I put into the public domain that I received a contribution arising from a function I attended in Manchester.  I publicly disclosed this payment in order that the full facts relating to all payments made to me during a difficult personal and family time would be available to the public.  I do not know the exact amount of the sterling cash I received.  However, I know that when I changed this money to Irish pounds, it came to &pound;7,938.49.  At the time I lodged this money into my account on 11 October 1994, the sterling/punt exchange rate was 0.9883 &mdash; the sterling equivalent of the &pound;7,938.49 was approximately Stg&pound;7,845.61.</P>
        <P>As is well known, I have always been a supporter of Manchester United Football Club.  Since my youth, I have regularly travelled to Manchester.  From 1979 to 1996, I would have attended roughly six Man United home games each season.  I would travel with friends, sometimes by boat and sometimes by plane.  Over the years, I have developed a very close affinity with that city and with its people.  I have had a long-standing association with the Dublin Association in Manchester, the Manchester-Irish Festival and the Irish World Heritage Centre.</P>
        <P>The function that has been the source of recent controversy was not a political function or a fundraiser.  It was just a way for me to keep in touch with members of the Irish community in a city I visit often and have great ties with.  I had attended similar dinners and social occasions previously.</P>
        <P>The dinner was organised by the late Tim Kilroe in the Four Seasons Hotel in Manchester.  I had a long personal history with Mr. Kilroe, whom I counted as a friend.  At the end of the dinner, unsolicited by me, I was presented with cash of the order of Stg&pound;8,000, made up by individual contributions from an attendance of <Col N="1257"/>approximately 25 people.  Mr. Kilroe presented the moneys to me and I presume he had collected them as well.  Unfortunately, Mr. Kilroe has since died and it is not possible to obtain any list of attendees or contributors at this remove, 12 years later.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that Mr. John Kennedy attended the dinner, as he has publicly stated.  As I attended various other functions in Manchester over the years, I cannot state with certainty who were the other persons in attendance.  I do not want to name someone by mistake and then be accused of misleading the House.</P>
        <P>I travelled to Manchester with a number of personal friends &mdash; as I did for all of the matches &mdash; and on this occasion, my friends also attended the function.  Senator Kett was on this trip and attended this function.  If the names of any other people who attended come to my attention and if I can be certain that they attended, I will pass their names on to the tribunal.</P>
        <P>I did not receive the money as a fee for a speaking engagement.  In fact, I did not even deliver a formal speech.  I merely said a few words and engaged in an informal question and answer session.  I did not solicit the money.  I did not expect to receive it.  I believe Mr. Kilroe organised a collection at the function for me because he knew, through friends, of my personal circumstances, and that he may have told others.</P>
        <P>There are two fundamental issues that I now want to address: first, whether any code of ethics or conduct was breached; and second, whether there is any tax liability in respect of the receipt by me of the sum of approximately Stg&pound;8,000.</P>
        <P>The 1983 Government Procedure Instruction, which was applicable in 1994, is crystal clear.  It states there are no formal guidelines on the issue of gifts to Ministers.  The practice has been to accept relatively inexpensive gifts to mark occasions such as official openings.  There was a practice relating to expensive gifts given to Ministers &mdash; that practice related to gifts given to Ministers by virtue of their office.</P>
        <P>Indeed, section 15 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, which was not in force at the time of the Manchester event, reflects this principle by stating explicitly that the rules apply to gifts given to the officeholder &ldquo;by virtue of his or her office&rdquo; &mdash; personal gifts and donations are expressly excluded.  The 1983 instruction did not address personal gifts or political donations.  The sum in the region of Stg&pound;8,000 was not received by virtue of my office.  It was given to me personally by a group of approximately 25 people to whom I spoke in a personal capacity.</P>
        <P>I shall explain why there was no breach of the Government procedure instruction.  First, the trip was personal.  It does not appear in my ministerial diary, which would be the case if it was an official trip.  Second, no formal invitation was extended to me as Minister as Finance or sent to the Department of Finance.  Third, the Department <Col N="1258"/>of Finance did not pay the costs of my travel or accommodation; I did.  Fourth, no script was prepared by officials in the Department of Finance, as would normally be the case if I was giving a speech on official business and, thus, by virtue of my office.  Fifth, I was accompanied on the trip not by officials, but by a number of friends who attended a Manchester United fixture.  Sixth, I attended similar events before and after the 1994 one both while in office and out of office.  Seventh, at the 1994 event, I was given approximately Stg&pound;8,000.  These moneys were not solicited by me.  The above facts lead to only one rational conclusion.  My attendance in Manchester and at the event was not in an official capacity.  I was not at the event in Manchester by virtue of my office.  The 1983 Government procedure instruction simply did not apply.  I have received advice from counsel that I was not in breach of the 1983 Government procedure instruction.  Counsel have stated clearly and unequivocally that paragraph 31 of the instruction did not apply to the Manchester event and the moneys received on that occasion.</P>
        <P>I refer to the legal context in which these events occurred.  The obligations that apply to officeholders under the relevant legislation and code of conduct are significantly more detailed now than in 1993 and 1994.  However, the spirit and intent are broadly similar.  At that time the Government procedure instructions envisaged that Ministers would not accept expensive gifts arising from the performance of their duties.  The Ethics in Public Office Bill 1995 was prepared by a Government of which I was a member.  In the case of gifts to officeholders the main purpose of the Bill, as described by the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Eithne Fitzgerald, in the House was to provide &ldquo;that if a gift is given to a officeholder and if the value of that gift exceeds &pound;500, that gift becomes the property of the State in cases where the gift is given by virtue of that office&rdquo;.  There was no intention of inhibiting the normal relationships of support and solidarity between friends when there was clearly no intention of influencing or compromising an officeholder.  This was made evident during the debate on this Bill.  For example, in June 1995, concern was expressed by a number of Deputies as to whether it was appropriate that the fact that medical or legal services had been supplied free or below cost to a Member would be required to be disclosed.  A particular possibility of whether legal services being provided in anticipation of ultimate payment on conclusion of a case or a tribunal of inquiry would require to be disclosed in respect of a year when the fee had not yet been paid.  That was argued to be unacceptable.</P>
        <P>These issues were repeated during the Seanad debate on the Bill in July 1995.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, assured Senators that &ldquo;medical or legal services supplied free or at a discount to a value of more than &pound;500 where <Col N="1259"/>this is provided by a friend or relative without any suggestion of trying to influence or create an obligation&rdquo; would not require disclosure of any kind.  She said, &ldquo;If somebody&rsquo;s friends organised for personal reasons to pay for his or her medical treatment, they are not trying to influence that person in the performance of his or her functions and this would be exempt&rdquo;.  Reading through those debates, this was the understanding under which politicians by sponsoring the Ethics in Public Office Bill 1995 were intended to be bound at the time of these events in 1993 and 1994.  It was clearly understood that, in the appropriate context, politicians could receive gifts from friends without creating obligations or requiring disclosure.  This was especially the case when the privacy of their personal lives reasonably required protection as in the case of legal, medical and, I would say, family circumstances.  Ministers could also accept gifts of a modest character defined as less than &pound;500 even if this arose in the context of official duties.  Furthermore, under the legislation which the Government at that time put forward, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 1994, donations received for political as opposed to personal reasons could be retained and disclosed only where the individual donation exceeded &pound;500.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given my family and personal circumstances, which provided the context for the loans and gifts I accepted in 1993 and 1994 and given the clear intent of those who made these payments in respect of my personal purposes, I have considered the content of the ethical code in place then and since then.  I consider that I had not breached my obligations as an officeholder in any way.  Ministers from all political backgrounds can and do attend fundraising events and receive donations and personal gifts.  Moneys are raised at such functions attended by Ministers but they do not attend in an official capacity or they do not raise these funds by virtue of their office.  What matters is that funds are only received in circumstances which are legally and ethically permissible and, especially, that the receipt of the funds does not give rise to the expectation of a<i> quid pro quo</i>.  The Manchester event did not involve any <i>quid pro quo </i>for anyone.</P>
        <P>I have been separately advised by two eminent tax advisers that I have no tax liability in respect of the Manchester moneys.  The funds were from persons based in the Manchester area who are not based in Ireland and, therefore, the sums were not chargeable to gift tax.  In any event, the aggregate sum was less than IR&pound;8,000 and this was well below the threshold for any gift tax that then applied, which was more than IR&pound;11,000.  Bearing in mind the small gift exemption of &pound;500 which then applied, there would be no question of a liability to gift tax.  The funds were later lodged to my bank account in AIB in Dublin.</P><Col N="1260"/>
        <P>There are few of us with the benefit of hindsight who would not change some of our past decisions.  No one is infallible or perfect.  If I had anticipated in 1993 and 1994 that my decision to accept loans from friends or the gifts of moneys in Manchester would cause such difficulties and media intrusion for my family and friends and would give rise to distortion of my motives and misrepresentation of my conduct, I would not have accepted a penny.  As I surveyed events of the past two weeks, I realised that my judgment in accepting help from good and loyal friends and the gift in Manchester, albeit in the context of personal and family circumstances, was an error.  It was a misjudgment, although not in breach of any law or code of conduct at the time.  It was not illegal or impermissible to have done what I did but I now regret the choices I made in those difficult and dark times.  The bewilderment caused to the public about recent revelations has been deeply upsetting for me and others near and dear to me.  To them, to the Irish people and to this House, I offer my apologies.</P>

	<P>This is supposed to be accountability day.  This is supposed to be the day when standards are defined and adhered to.  This Taoiseach is still the great evader.  I was elected to the House in 1975 while the Taoiseach was elected in 1977.  Through those years I have watched his rise through Fianna F&aacute;il as a Minister of State, Whip, Minister and Taoiseach.  In all those years in politics, I have never descended to the level of bitter personal activities in this House.  That has been my stand for 30 years, it has been my stand in this controversy and it will be my stand in Government.  No Member of the Opposition raised the issue of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s sensitive, emotional marital circumstances.  These were brought into the public domain by the Taoiseach himself and a litany of Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers over the past 12 days.  </P>

	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, can check the record.  I respect utterly the Taoiseach&rsquo;s right to a private life and his family&rsquo;s right to a private life.  This is no business of mine and I will not stray into that area.</P>
        <P>Politically my attitude is radically different from the Taoiseach who came into the house just a short time after myself.  For 12 days we have witnessed him with each intervention he has made failing to clarify matters.  Today, he did not address the fundamental issue at stake.  There are many things we do not know about these matters <Col N="1261"/>and we hope to get some answers in the following period.</P>
        <P>We know a couple of fundamental facts.   The Taoiseach admitted to accepting, while Minister for Finance in 1993 and 1994, cash to the value of &euro;61,000 from businessmen friends and associates.  We know that this cash was accepted by the Taoiseach after three separate collections.  We know too that the Taoiseach claims to have had &euro;63,000 of personal savings at a time when he had no bank account.</P>
        <P>We thought that the culture of old Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; that of Haughey, Burke and others &mdash; was long since gone, but it appears to be accepted again by the Ministers, Deputies Cullen, Martin, Cowen, O&rsquo;Dea, Roche, Hanafin, Coughlan and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  All have come out and stated the Taoiseach did no wrong.  The only Deputy to break the silence, the <i>omerta</i>, was Deputy Nolan from the backbenches, where he will probably stay.</P>
        <P>Does the following sound familiar?  &ldquo;I am taking the opportunity to state unequivocally that I have done nothing illegal, unethical or improper.&rdquo;  These are the words of former Deputy Raphael Burke spoken in this House on 10 September 1997 &mdash; same words, same standards, but a different application.  I thought this country had moved on from that period.  I thought we had moved away from the Haughey era of the 1980s but, apparently, new Fianna F&aacute;il resurrects the same old standards in the same old way.</P>
        <P>Of the first two items, the collection and acceptance by a Minister for Finance of cash to the value of &euro;61,000, we know one fundamental fact &mdash; it was wrong.  There is no need for discussion of ethics, no need for legislation, no need for guidelines.  When the Taoiseach put his hand on that money in his then capacity as Minister for Finance, private or public, he did wrong.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He was wrong to conceal it for the past 13 years, wrong to condemn hypocritically in this House when he knew he had accepted money, and wrong to declare he had done nothing wrong.  Today, he says it is an error and a misjudgment, honest or otherwise.  He refuses to face the questions I asked him last week.  Is he man enough to state that what he did in accepting this money for personal use was wrong?</P>
        <P>I would like the Taoiseach to answer the following questions.  Last week, I asked him whether he would admit to his actions being wrong.  Last Sunday he wrote: &ldquo;I have done nothing wrong.  I stand over everything I did.&rdquo;  That is an application of double standards &mdash; preach one thing, do another.  The Taoiseach told RTE newscaster Brian Dobson:</P><Col N="1262"/>
        <P LI="1">[My friends] wanted to raise a function for me.  1,000 a head, 25-30 people.  I said no, I wasn&rsquo;t going to do that.  That was personal [money].  Anyone does that, it&rsquo;s for politics, so I refused.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Good man.  However, the Taoiseach saw nothing wrong with personally accepting &euro;12,000 raised by friends in Manchester, except this time it was from 25 people at &euro;500 a head.  Why, by his own standards, was it wrong in Dublin but right in Manchester?  The Taoiseach is the accountant.  He knows the tax laws.  Was it because a personal donation in Dublin would be taxable but one from Manchester would not?</P>
        <P>Second, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s taking of &euro;12,000 in Manchester deserves some straight answers.  He was speaking to a business organisation about the Irish economy.  By any interpretation, it would be unthinkable for a Minister to put money in his or her pocket.  If the Secretary General of the Department accepted money at any such function, that person would be sacked by the Taoiseach the following morning, rightly so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach cannot apply one standard to himself and a different one to others.  Did he not think it strange or unusual that it was at this event only that he received payment?</P>
        <P>Third, the Taoiseach has claimed persistently that the first payment of &pound;16,500 came from individuals and that now, 13 years later, he has repaid those individuals.  Can he explain how at least one of those payments was made by company cheque?  When he made efforts over the years to repay that company, what was its response in respect of the cheque issued to him?  Can he explain why he accepted a loan from eight people to pay one loan to a bank, if that was the case?</P>

	<P>Finally, the Taoiseach in his interview with Brian Dobson referred to whether it was a political donation or a personal donation.  The Taoiseach appears to consider the idea that this was first a political donation, which therefore could be passed to his party or constituency.  What made him decide it was really a personal donation that would go into his own pocket?  Was it made by cash or cheque?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fair to state that the Opposition has shown restraint in the matter of the Taoiseach accepting money for private use while a Minister.  However, since Mr. Ahern had created a context that sought to explain the Drumcondra moneys in terms of his private family affairs, common decency required that Opposition politicians should have demonstrated a certain restraint.  Today, for the first time, he seeks to drag the Manchester moneys into that same category.  On Sunday, I heard the Minister <Col N="1264"/>of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, ridicule Opposition restraint.  It was, he said, ineffectiveness, not decency, on the part of the Opposition.  The suggestion, apparently, is that the Opposition should cut through the smokescreen to the heart of the matter.</P>
        <P>To me the heart of the matter is this; did the Taoiseach do wrong?  Is it remotely credible that moneys outstanding for 13 years, without repayment of any kind, can suddenly be categorised as loans?  One does not need to be as bright as the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to know that these transactions, if they happened, were gifts and therefore have tax implications.</P>
        <P>On the Manchester moneys, can we do more than highlight the absolute impropriety of a serving Minister for Finance accepting payment for a nixer outside the State?  Never mind the &ldquo;no law was broken&rdquo; defence.  By any standards, it was wrong.  What would have happened, as Deputy Kenny asked, to a senior civil servant in the Department of Finance if he had trousered private money from such an event?  He would have been dismissed.  Why is it all right for the Minister for Finance but not all right for a civil servant in his Department?</P>
        <P>What does one say about this Government&rsquo;s standards when not a single Cabinet Minister can bring himself or herself to say that what happened at Manchester was wrong?  One would believe in the tooth fairy if one believes that businessmen happen along to a function in a posh hotel to listen to any old Joe Soap lecture on the Irish economy and then organise an impromptu whip around to give him something for himself.  In normal life one gets gifts from one&rsquo;s friends and one takes loans from strangers.  Yet, Mr. Ahern says he got loans from his friends and took gifts from strangers.</P>
        <P>Maybe the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan&rsquo;s, derision of the Opposition is because we did not adequately probe the discreet veil drawn over the other &euro;50,000 which Mr. Ahern enigmatically tells us he put back into his account.  &ldquo;Back into his account from where?&rdquo; is the question that must be answered.  Where was the &euro;50,000 resting since the then Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern, did not have a bank account?  Was it resting in a sock or in the hot press?  If the Taoiseach says this &euro;50,000 was savings, I accept that, but he enjoyed a ministerial and Deputy&rsquo;s salary and the use of a premises bought for him by friends of Fianna F&aacute;il.  In those circumstances, how can he be portrayed as living in straitened conditions?  If he had &euro;50,000 in savings, why was it necessary to raise a bank loan?  If a bank loan was in place, why was it necessary to have a whip-around to replace the bank loan?</P>
        <P>Any Opposition doing its job must ask the Taoiseach whether he has evaded tax.  Why did he say that he paid capital gains tax and gift tax?  How is it relevant in this case?  Is he serious when he tells the country that he had no bank account <Col N="1265"/>when he was Minister for Finance?  Did he have a bank account elsewhere on the island?  Did he have a bank account outside the jurisdiction or did someone open an account on his behalf?  If the whip-around was among friends, why was a company cheque issued for &pound;5,000 from NCB?  How many times has NCB been retained by the State?  How does this sit with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s claim that they were friends and not big business?  How many of the donors were appointed on how many occasions to State boards?  Who were the donors in Manchester whose identity the T&aacute;naiste said he needed to know?  We are now down to two donors, one of whom is deceased.  What was that function?  Are these people involved in business in Ireland and did they get State contracts?  Is this another loop in the golden circle?</P>
        <P>Our new T&aacute;naiste is also impatient with the Opposition.  On Thursday, he told the House that he could scarcely forebear to sit there and watch the Opposition squander its accountability time.</P>

	<P>This debate is not about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s personal life, Mauritius, forged letters or the leaking of information.  The tribunal is dealing with this and, as the Taoiseach would say, we should let it deal with it.  The Government has some nerve to condemn leaks, given the way in which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has used his position to leak Garda files to selected journalists, while the Taoiseach stood by him.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is not about searching for a head on a plate but about ensuring that we have proper standards in Irish political life.  This affair is about facts of legitimate public interest.  It is about the fact that the Taoiseach took gifts from businesses and businessmen, that only ten days ago he misrepresented the established facts on Clare FM and has attempted to avoid answering legitimate questions on the matter ever since, that, as Minister for Finance, he secured payments for personal benefit and that he has transgressed ethical standards that a Minister or head of Government would have to follow in Scandinavia, Germany, the UK, the USA or any other developed country. </P>
        <P>Faced with these facts last week, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il seemed unsure of whether he was an asset or a liability.  One Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy was quoted as saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m baffled and I don&rsquo;t know what to think.&rdquo;  Only one went so far as to admit that the Taoiseach was compromised, but then, on mature reflection, he changed his mind.  On this side of the House, we have given the Taoiseach every opportunity to resolve the issues, which are entirely of his own making.  As the Green Party has a sense of fair play, we wanted to listen to him, but so far we are not impressed.</P>
        <P>This debate is about trust in politics.  It is about people faced with lifelong mortgages being impoverished to pay for the speculative profits that the Taoiseach allowed a small group of developers to accrue.  Shame on the Taoiseach for being beholden to these vested interests.  We cannot allow cynicism about our democratic system to grow.  Shame on the Taoiseach for undermining the people&rsquo;s trust and for bringing the office of Taoiseach into disrepute.</P>
        <P>This debate is about living and working according to the standards that the Taoiseach purported <Col N="1267"/>to hold and the good name of this country.  Fundamentally, this debate is about right and wrong.  The Ethics in Public Life Act may not have existed in 1994 but ethics certainly did.  What the Taoiseach did in taking money from businesses and businessmen was and is totally inappropriate and improper.  It was unethical and wrong.  Most seriously, he has undermined his leadership by surrendering his moral authority.  How can he be expected to bring to book the Ministers who serve with him?  They will ask, &ldquo;Who are you to set standards?&rdquo;  In addressing the question of whether what the Taoiseach did was right, I am struck by the fact that not one of his Ministers said that what he did was right.  His deputy leader says he is &ldquo;not incorrect&rdquo;, which is clearly the formulation of a lawyer and, as a defence, is both weak and irrelevant to this debate.</P>
        <P>It must be noted that the Taoiseach is not the only person to have shown himself to be ethically compromised in the course of this affair.  The Progressive Democrats have shown themselves to be now more interested in clinging to power than in standards in public office.  Meanwhile, Government parties and other parties in this House continue to accept corporate donations, leaving themselves beholden to corporate interests.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has three options by which he can show some leadership.  He can resign.  By his own standards, which he set out in 1997 and which he has applied to other office holders, he would have gone.  If I was in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position, I would have had no option but to resign.  Alternatively, he can go to the people and give them the choice of whose ethics and political culture they want running this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a third option, which would also be a positive action.  Will the Taoiseach introduce legislation to ban corporate donations to political parties and limit personal donations to nominal sums rather than a sum equalling the price of a house or a large yacht?  Will he cut the financial ties between vested interests and policymakers forever? </P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>By normal standards, including his own expressed standards, the Taoiseach should not still hold his position.  He has lost moral authority.  What he has done is not right.  It is unethical and improper and does not befit high office.  However, the issue is bigger than the Taoiseach and his job, his party or, indeed, his coalition partners.  We have taken up too much newsprint, too much air time and too much legislative time with this affair.  We need to end it and let politics return to the issues, namely, the chronic issues in health, housing, transport, education and energy.</P>

	<P>Of course it was not confined to Fianna F&aacute;il.  Fine Gael has shown, through the tribunals, that it too shares a similar culture.  There is no suggestion that members of the current Fianna F&aacute;il-PD Cabinet have personally benefited from bribes or backhanders during their term of office.

It is unlikely however, that many of them will have circles of wealthy friends ready to help them out in such a time of financial crisis.  Today, at Ballinaboy in Mayo, we saw another example of the natural consequences of the connection between Fianna F&aacute;il and big business.

What about the role of former Minister, Ray Burke, in the negotiation of the terms for oil and gas exploration, the most generous offered anywhere in the world to the major multinationals?  Let there be no mistake about it, the people deserve an explanation from the Taoiseach about this series of payments, loans and gifts from wealthy busi<Col N="1271"/>nessmen.  However, the events of the last week should not distract us from this Government&rsquo;s long-standing political bankruptcy.  That is something that no whip-around will be able to remedy.  All of these are valid reasons this Fianna F&aacute;il-PD coalition should resign from office immediately and go to the people.  The people are ready to give judgment.</P>

	<P>We were not handcuffed, Joe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We now know that Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers see nothing wrong with a Minister for Finance taking large amounts of money for personal use from business interests as long, they say, as there is no proof that any specific favours were done.  Thereby, they defend not only the major conflict of interest involving the Taoiseach when he accepted &euro;60,000 from wealthy individuals, but they also defend the sleaze, cronyism, patronage and corruption that pervaded politics in the 1980s and 1990s.  Not one person was caught in the middle of that who did not come up with the same catch-cry: &ldquo;We did no favours and we did nothing wrong&rdquo;.  How could Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers think there was anything wrong when the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is massively financed by big business?  Big business financing individual leaders on the one hand, or the party on the other, is a continuous process.</P>
        <P>There is a tendency to isolate this controversy of moneys to the Taoiseach but it cannot be boxed off from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s relationship with big business interests, Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s relationship with big business interests, and the PD&rsquo;s relationship with big business interests &mdash; they accept massive funds from those sources as well.  It was the Taoiseach&rsquo;s associate who helped him with his personal donations; who, in the 1990s, sat in a plush Dublin hotel and took in millions from speculators, developers, multinational corporations, oil companies and any kind of moneybags that darkened the door of his plush suite.  Every ordinary person knows that business does this to influence Government policies, and that it succeeds.  Ordinary people are the victims of this.  Look at the strife, struggle and stress that young people must endure to secure the basic right of a roof over their heads because the Fianna F&aacute;il-backing speculators have put the price of a home out of their reach.  The Government sat and let them do it for ten years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Tens of thousands were heartlessly priced out of the market by the speculators <Col N="1272"/>who financed the parties opposite.  Tens of thousands are terrified of the mortgage increases &mdash; perhaps up to &euro;200 a month &mdash; they fear are now due.  That amounts to &euro;2,400 a year, which will virtually impoverish them but it is cigar money to the wealthy people who finance the Taoiseach.  Most shamefully, look at how Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats were obliging the Shell Oil Corporation this morning, manhandling the decent people of Erris, so that Shell, the most notorious polluter and profiteer virtually on the globe, can get the gas they have given it for nothing out of the sea.  This process started with the then Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, in 1997 and continued in 1992 under the Minister for Finance, now Taoiseach, when they gave fabulous natural resources to these companies for absolutely nothing in secret deals.  How much did Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats get from the oil companies?</P>
        <P>How nauseating, in view of all this, to see Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, reduce this whole controversy, this nexus of patronage and sleaze, to a cynical game of scrabble, of bending and twisting words so that both parties can walk out claiming to be vindicated.  Taking large amounts of money from business, as the Taoiseach has said today, was an error and a misjudgment not because it was wrong, not because there was a massive conflict of interest, but because it came out into the open and caused grief and consternation to the Taoiseach and his friends.  The T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Progressive Democrats sits beside him and applauds that particular statement.</P>
        <P>What the T&aacute;naiste is doing today is propping up an unreconstructed Fianna F&aacute;il Party, still defending sleaze after ten years of investigation.  Was it for this that the T&aacute;naiste flew to the tops of the lamp posts all over Dublin to tell us we needed him in Government to straighten out the Fianna F&aacute;il chancers?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a long period for detailed questions.  For today, I will ignore the later political points made.  I do not think any fair examination of this issue would accept that sleaze, cronyism, corruption, big business interests running the political process, conflicts of interests, patronage or any of the points made by the last few speakers are correct by any stretch of the imagination.  I said what I said earlier, so there is no point going back over it.  </P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny and Deputy Rabbitte followed the points made.  Deputy Kenny asked if I ran any other fundraisers or received political donations outside the State for myself.  The answer to that question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The reason I raised the issue was that it was there.  Any other fundraisers I would ever have been involved in were party political fundraisers and were done in the normal way, but nothing was done for me.  This was not a fundraiser for me.  It was not organised as a fundraiser.  As I had been present at these functions many times, I was surprised that somebody would offer me anything.  It was done for the same reason as the other issues.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte made a valid point which I will explain.  I said today that the Manchester money was associated with the other payments.  I actually lodged it on the same lodgment as the &pound;16,500 and it was related to exactly the same period and the same issue.</P>
        <P>Questions were raised about St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I do not own it; St. Luke&rsquo;s is owned by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I have no long-term beneficial interest in it, but I declare my short-term interest in it as a public office.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny asked if these loans were over a long period.  I answered that question last week but I would like to answer it again.  Some colleagues of mine, knowing the difficulties &mdash; difficulties that in the cold light of day could have been surmounted in another way &mdash; believed they were being helpful and wanted to run a fund<Col N="1274"/>raiser.  That would have been a fundraiser where I was going to get the money and use that for personal circumstances.  That was clearly wrong.  It would have been organised as a fundraiser for me to do that.  I said no.  I said the only way that I would accept the money was on the basis that it would be loans that I would pay back.  I would have paid those loans back years ago, quite frankly, except that when it came up it was stated that, because I was answering questions at the tribunals, it was better not to do it that way.  Right or wrong, that was the decision I made at that stage.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Manchester issue, a contribution was made that I did not expect.  It was not a fundraising night.  I was not present in my official capacity or as part of my office; it was an entirely different position.  I will answer any of the detailed issues.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked if I had savings and bank accounts.  I think I reflected on that question but if I have to go into it, I will.  He asked if I had any bank accounts in my own name.  I had several bank accounts in joint names with my wife, but I was not using those bank accounts at the time of my separation until that was over.  I had one account in my own name which was a dormant account.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked the fair question if I had accounts anywhere else, if I had accounts outside the State or if anyone outside the State opened accounts for me.  The answer to that question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I had no other accounts whatsoever.  I operated for a fairly long period without a bank account and did keep that money in my own possession during that period.  I had no other accounts.  I will answer the detailed questions, but they were the relevant ones.</P>
        <P>I will not go into the political questions today but I wish to make one point.  Two party leaders have raised the issue of housing.  I am very proud of the fact that the Government I lead has, in the last few years, built 515,000 houses, a third of the entire housing stock of the country.  The vast majority of those houses have gone to first-time buyers.</P>

	<P Just="Left">He will get his comeuppance.  He is probably the nastiest bit of goods of them all.  I want to return to two fundamental issues.  In his response the Taoiseach said this was an error and a misjudgment.  This appears to be the best the Progressive Democrats have been able to wring out of all the contacts over the weekend between Tipperary, Dublin and everywhere else.  This would not have happened in the days of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s immediate predecessor.  She has a clearer view of probity, justice, right and wrong than he who is supposed to be in charge of the scales of justice in this country.</P>

	<P>When a Minister steps forward to receive his or her seal of office from Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, he or she crosses a threshold which is indivisible between private and public.  While the Taoiseach may well have been in casual gear at the function in Manchester, those present saw him not as an ordinary citizen but as a citizen who happened to be the Minister for Finance.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In that regard, the Taoiseach said in respect of the &euro;16,500, the second payment, that the payments were made in the form of cash, personal cheque or company cheque.  The use to which the Taoiseach put that money is unclear.  In his television interview he said: &ldquo;I had no house, the house was gone so they decided to try to help me.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1276"/>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I make the point that the entire Government will not accept that what the Taoiseach did in accepting the money in Manchester was wrong.  I ask him now, with regard to his comment in respect of the &euro;16,500, was the money used towards the purchase of his house?  Who started the collection at the function in Manchester?  Was it a Manchester person or was it one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s friends from Dublin and, if so, does he know who it was?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think we have seen any cynicism or hypocrisy today.  I still believe as strongly in probity as I ever did.  Deputy Kenny asked two direct questions.  He asked if I used that money for the purchase of my house.  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I purchased my house with an Irish Permanent Building Society loan and some money from my current account which was not linked to this current account.  I saw a report the other day that I bought my house for &pound;67,000 or something, but that is not true.  My loan was an Irish Permanent Building Society loan and mortgage which I took out and paid over recent years.</P>
        <P>On the other issue, I had no knowledge that anybody was organising a fundraiser.  None of the people who was with me asked anybody to raise funds for me in Manchester.  Nobody did that.  I do not believe that one of those I had told at the end of that weekend was even aware of the issue.  I would think that some of my friends would have spoken previously about my circumstances, but that was no secret to some of my friends in Manchester because the issue of my personal circumstances had been in the newspapers a number of times that summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I still cannot understand how any Minister, particularly a senior Minister, could sit at a function and have &pound;8,000 sterling collected around the table, accept it and put his hand on it.  The fundamental issue is that the Taoiseach will not accept that action was wrong, that it sends out a signal about politics and politicians in Ireland that is incredible for every young person with an interest, remote or otherwise, in politics.  All the Ministers here, including the Progressive Democrats, accept that this is a standard that applies in Irish politics from the head of Government down.  That is the difference between the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party and mine.  It is wrong and he is afraid to admit it is wrong.  The T&aacute;naiste is nodding his head.  He knows that to accept &pound;8,000 <Col N="1277"/>sterling at a function in Manchester or anywhere else, whether private or public, is utterly wrong and, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he should be man enough to stand up and say so.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions.  Is the Taoiseach saying that money received at a function like this is not to be considered as a matter of ethical judgment if there is no official invitation or script and it is not in the Minister&rsquo;s diary?  In other words, can one accept anything outside of that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have another opportunity to put questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is he saying that unless the payment can be shown to create an obligation on the officeholder in the performance of his or her duty it is all right or that it must be shown that there is an obligation and otherwise it is fair game to accept anything and everything?  Is that the standard, which was evident in this case, that we must now accept from the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny said the money was collected around the table, as if I was sitting there and watching it, but that is not what happened.  At the end of the night, Mr. Tim Kilroe, who owned the hotel, gave me the money.  It was not collected like that.  If I sat there in any capacity and saw that happen, I would not have accepted it, and I think the Deputy knows that.  It was not that kind of position and it cannot be put forward as such.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, I have said it was an error; it was a misjudgment.  The Deputy has asked what the codes are.  The codes are well documented.  I had a hand in later codes, but I did not have a hand in the codes then.  Having watched what has occurred over the past few weeks and having watched what I have been faced with, I wonder what would happen in the future.  Any Member who attends a function and receives a contribution of less than &euro;500, if it is a fundraising issue he or she can put the donation into his or her political donation account and record who gave it.  Next January when the Member makes his or her declaration he or she can put down that somebody gave &euro;500.  That is all any Member does.  The impression that has been given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>There are no twists.  I will give a factual position.  I am conscious that I am not just talking to this House.  The position that operates for most Members in this House today under the Ethics in Public Office Act is that if <Col N="1278"/>they have a fundraising function they put the funds raised into a political account and record the names of the donors and whether somebody has contributed over &euro;500.  That is proper and is as it should be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to answer the Fine Gael leader&rsquo;s question.  I opted to tell the whole truth, 100% truth, and did not say that something that was a personal sum was a political donation.  If I had been in Manchester last Friday and received the same donation, I could have taken the list of names from Tim Kilroe, put that money into my political account and made a declaration.  The reason I did not and the reason I raised it last week was that I did not want to be accused through some future leak, since everything may be leaked.  I did not want to be caught in that way.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making a distinction.  I have no problem with the current situation but to say that what I did was totally unethical is untrue.  If I had been hypocritical, with a slight adjustment, I would have said it was a fundraiser.  It was not a fundraiser because I used it for myself and that was the reason I made the distinction.  However, I still say it was an error.  It was a lack of judgment by me, and I am glad to say that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Taoiseach say with a straight face that he could have accepted the money last week and put it into his political account?  This is the whole point.  If he put it into his political account, he could only use it for political purposes.  He did not put it into his political account; he put it into his personal account.  Is that not the whole point?  Why does the Taoiseach drag this red herring across it because it has absolutely nothing to do with it?  </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach referred to the late Mr. Kilroe collecting the money.  I refer to his declamation at Ballyjamesduff&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when he said: </P>
        <P LI="1">What happened was that some of my own friends were over there.  I think some of them were there.  On the one night they collected it.  Needless to say, it was not something I asked for.  It was totally a surprise to me.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It appears the lads collected it, not Mr. Kilroe.  I am only quoting the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own words to <Col N="1279"/>him.  Does the Taoiseach still maintain that <i>The Irish Times</i> was &ldquo;off the wall&rdquo; when it stated that the money being investigated by the tribunal was between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000?  We have three separate moieties: &euro;39,000, or almost &euro;50,000; &pound;8,000 sterling and the other &euro;50,000.  How can the Taoiseach say that<i> The Irish Times</i> was &ldquo;off the wall&rdquo;?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has advice now.  How can he say it was &ldquo;off the wall&rdquo;?  I wish to ask a question about the NCB cheque.  The Taoiseach informed the House several times that this was a group of friends helping him out at a time of distress.  This cheque was a corporate cheque.  Has the Taoiseach made any inquiries with NCB about the status of the cheque, about the tax liability attaching to it or anything else?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A City West cheque.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has the Taoiseach abandoned the test he set down in the House when we previously discussed this matter a few years ago, when he stated that if somebody sought to present something as a loan, he would need to have incontrovertible, written evidence, including the arrangements for repayment entered into at the time?  Why does that not apply in the case of Drumcondra moneys one and two?  Incidentally, if the Taoiseach lodged the money from Manchester on the same day as he lodged Drumcondra two, when does that date the event in Manchester?  If the Taoiseach tracked the event down to the Four Seasons Hotel, can he, for the sake of completeness, say to the House when that particular event took place?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach cherry-picked the questions he answered and the format facilitates that.  In respect of the other &euro;50,000, did that come entirely from his salary and his parliamentary allowances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not trying to cherry-pick the questions.  The point I made on the political funds was that at that time there was no such thing as a political account.  Everybody at that time would have lodged fundraising moneys, if they did not relate to the constituency, into their own accounts.  I did not do so because I always kept them separate even though there was no obligation to do that.  I know that people on all sides of the House did that.  If one reads the debate on the public office Bill, one will read what people did at that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has said it was not a political donation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1280"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point I am making.  Because I was honest I said it was not a political donation and I kept it separate.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to my Cavan contribution when the media asked me to make a lengthy reply &mdash; a question arises as to whether one should or should not do so in these instances, but I did so in order to be helpful &mdash; but they were certainly not my friends who asked for this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept the record?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept, if that is what is stated there, that it is incorrect.  I made it clear throughout that it was not them.</P>
        <P>On the NCB issue, the initial loan which I received from eight friends, included money from P&aacute;draic O&rsquo;Connor.  This money came to me in the form of a bank draft.  It was not a cheque and could not therefore have been a company cheque.  I think everyone is aware that bank drafts are drawn on a specified bank and in this case it was drawn on the Bank of Ireland and does not carry the name of the person who drew it.  As far as I was aware, P&aacute;draic O&rsquo;Connor personally gave me this and I never believed anything else, and I repaid P&aacute;draic O&rsquo;Connor.  I have not discussed this with P&aacute;draic O&rsquo;Connor.  A number of my friends wanted to give me a donation and I refused a donation.  I stated that the only reason I would accept it was based on the fact that it was a condition of a loan and that I would repay it.  I made that clear from the outset.  I may not have gone back to every individual a number of times but I went back to a number of individuals several times and said that I was in a position to pay it and I would rather pay it.  My savings were totally out of my own income, from my TD&rsquo;s salary and my salary as Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>In answer to the question about the dates, I was in Manchester at least seven times in 1994.  I cannot say exactly which date it was but I think that function was probably early in the season, in the autumn of 1994.  However, I cannot be certain because from what I have been able to gather from people I&mdash;&mdash;</P>

None of them has come forward.  I ask the Taoiseach, before this debate finishes, to set out clearly why the Progressive Democrats can stomach this.  How did the Taoiseach reach an agreement over the weekend with the Minister, Deputy McDowell?  What happened the Minister when he led his troops up the hill and then, like the old Duke of York, led them down again?  I can imagine how those fellows on the backbenches will treat him in the coming months.</P>

	<P>On RTE, the Taoiseach made the point that one of the problems he had in the 1990s was with expensive legal fees as a result of issues in which he was involved.  Many Independent Deputies have made the point to me in recent days that constituents of theirs facing the same fees were not able to proceed to the courts to try to get the justice they deserved because they could not afford the fees being charged.  In the powerful position he had in Government would it not have been a more appropriate response for the Taoiseach, rather than take a hand-out from very wealthy friends, to have taken steps to curb the obscene level of fees a section of the Law Library charges ordinary people as they try to get justice?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach also brought &pound;50,000 worth of savings into the story.  Why did he bring this into the public domain?  Was it because a sum of &pound;50,000 was deposited on one occasion when he eventually opened a bank account and the tribunal asked him to explain it?  If so, how did he accumulate that massive amount of &pound;50,000?  Did he accumulate it in cash and keep it in a shoebox as it grew month by month, year by year?  Does <Col N="1283"/>he not believe it was extremely incongruous that a Minister for Finance of a modern capitalist economy for a period of years stashed his savings in a shoebox?</P>

	<P>Bill Gates sending his letters by carrier pigeon comes to mind.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said today that it was an error and a misjudgement to have taken money from these business people.  Did he use those terms only because of the problems caused for him in the past week and the embarrassment and consternation to his party, not because it was wrong or because there was a potential conflict of interest?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I say to Deputy Higgins again, I did not take and neither will I ever say I took it from business people.  I accepted a loan that I paid back with interest.  I received &euro;38,000 &mdash; a loan from friends &mdash; and paid back more than &euro;90,000.  I accepted it from them because they were friends and I paid it back to them because they were friends.  It was in that capacity that I got it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was found out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not because of anything else.  There have been efforts to make them into business people who came together.  They were long and trusted friends of mine for many decades.</P>
        <P>The issue of savings arose because of completeness.  When I was giving the interview I gave the facts.  There was no one sum of &pound;50,000, but in my accounts and when I answered all my questions I showed where all my money came from in the period so that I could deny the issues I was being asked to answer, which gets lost in all these issues.  They were the issues to show that I did not get &pound;50,000 from Denis &ldquo;Starry&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien, on behalf of Owen O&rsquo;Callaghan, that I did not get a bribe from Owen O&rsquo;Callaghan, that I did not have offshore accounts in the Netherlands, the Antilles, Liechtenstein, Jersey or England with &euro;15 million and that I did not have forged accounts in Mauritius.  To the best of my ability for the years requested I showed precisely any lodgements and matched any lodgements to clear my name because these were the issues in which I was asked to co-operate.</P>
        <P>Yes, I did save the money and I did not save it in a shoebox.  In a capitalist state one might say it was in a shoebox.  If it was a socialist state, it would have been offshore or in some company&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>If the revelations came out not 13 years after his so-called loans, but perhaps 20 or 25 years later, would they still be unpaid and would they still be in the same category as they were when the Taoiseach was outed?  That is quite clearly the case.  The Taoiseach insists that these are not business people but just friends.  He told us that he only knew two of the Manchester crew.  Is he seriously telling the D&aacute;il that after appearing at several of these gigs over a period of years, presumably organised by the same people, with the same people in attendance, he only knew two of them and can now only account for two names?

I said in my opening statement that I would probably know all the people at that function in Manchester but I cannot pin down, without being able to talk to them all, who exactly was at what function and I do not want to do that.

	<P>The Taoiseach said, when his friends approached him about having a private function for him, that it would be wrong.  He also said, when they suggested they would give him a gift, that it would be wrong.  Why then, when it came to Manchester and this private function, was it a gift and apparently right?  How did this change come about?  A matter on which the Taoiseach had been very firm with his friends suddenly became all right in respect of Manchester.</P>
        <P>With regard to the new explanation being offered for the Manchester payment, as far as I can detect, the Taoiseach is offering two defences as to why it was all right to accept the payment in Manchester.  The first is that he was not there in a public capacity.  Is the Taoiseach saying that, if a Minister goes to a function and there is not an official invitation or official script and it is not in the Minister&rsquo;s diary, he or she can accept anything given?  Is that the new standard which the Taoiseach is applying?  The second defence which the Taoiseach seemed to give for the Manchester payment was that it was a gift and not for the performance of his duties.  Is the Taoiseach offering the new standard that a payment is only wrong if it can be shown that it creates precise obligations on the office holder?  Surely, that is the test of whether this payment was corrupt, not the question of whether it was ethical.</P>
        <P>The issue here is whether it was ethical to accept these payments.  Is it not the case that it was not ethical because it was a private function, which the Taoiseach said was wrong, was a gift, which he also said was wrong, and was interfering with his capacity to do his tasks?</P>
        <P>Is the defence being offered by the Taoiseach not the very same defence that was offered by Charles Haughey and, I am sure, would have been offered by Deputy Callely in the case of his misdemeanour?  Is the Taoiseach not applying entirely different standards, belatedly and in retrospect, to his own case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not.  What I stated with regard to a fundraising event being organised with the sole purpose of raising money for my personal use was that it was something I would not accept.  When it was put to me that my friends would do that, I said, no, I would not have that, and it was on that basis that I then said I would only accept it as loans.  The Manchester function was not organised on the basis of being a fundraiser for me or to raise money for me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what it did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not organised to do so.  People there who know me well gave me a donation afterwards, but it is not the same thing.  It was not organised for that purpose.  As the Deputy will see if he examines the Government procedures, with which he is familiar, it was crystal clear at that stage, even though there were no <Col N="1287"/>formal guidelines on such issues for Ministers, and in the 1995 legislation that it was by virtue of their offices.  Did I receive this by virtue of my office?  No, I did not.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s question of whether I am making a new explanation on the other money, I am not.  I linked them in the television programme, on which I did not have all day and obviously could not go into detail, because they were linked anyway.  It was not a new explanation and I linked them from the start.  I have said it was a misjudgment and an error in terms of looking back on it after two weeks of debate, but it was not in breach of tax law or the code of conduct which a Minister has to follow.  All my political life, I have tried to be as careful as I possibly can on these issues and I was extremely careful over the years, so it was not in breach.  Looking at how these things can be taken, it was a misjudgment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Thursday, the T&aacute;naiste said that one of the questions he wanted answered concerned the identity of the Manchester donors.  Will the Taoiseach tell the T&aacute;naiste and the House the identity of at least some of the people &mdash; or those he can remember &mdash; who gave him the money in Manchester?</P>
        <P>In response to an earlier question, the Taoiseach said 35 people came forward over the weekend to say they met him in Manchester.  Do I take it there are 35 people who think they gave him money in Manchester?</P>
        <P>With regard to his earlier statement that he would not accept the Drumcondra money by way of a fundraiser or a donation and his insistence that he would only accept the money as a loan, why did he not apply the same strictures to the money he received in Manchester?</P>
        <P>In response to an earlier question, he said there had not been any other fundraisers or political donations.  Did he receive any other unsolicited payments of any kind when he was a Minister but while he was not being a Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of people, maybe 33 or 34 instead of 35, have said they know me and think they met me at that function.  They did not say they gave me money. </P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They rang me because they heard there was an issue about functions, but the problem is that neither they nor I can be sure, 12 years on, whether it was that function.  The Deputy will be aware that I am well known in Manchester.  I have attended functions there for the better part of 30 years, as a councillor, backbencher, Front Bencher, Minister, Minister of State, Leader of the Opposition and Taoiseach. I hope I will continue to do so when I am out of this job sometime in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have close contacts with them.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore asked me a fair question.  I have tried as best I could, for the years requested by the tribunals and to prove my innocence in respect of all these other issues, to link all my payments and would have done that for the vast majority.  The very few I was unable to link were because I was not able to get bank records.  In so far as I have been able to piece together all my records, I do not believe I received unsolicited money.  Like everyone else, I received political donations over the period but not many because, throughout my career, I have allowed my constituency office to run fundraising activities.  Most of the money I ever got would have been for those periods.</P>
        <P>Lest it be misconstrued, Deputy Shortall asked a question when we were dealing with another question and I wish to answer it.  It was on a point of law that my legal team, on the <i>in camera</i> rule, has taken issue with the tribunal.  I follow the advice of my lawyers.  I have heard comment in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;about the reason I am blocking this.  I do not wish to make any comment about the legal issue because I have been warned about it so many times.  Every time I say something, whether in the D&aacute;il or outside, I get another letter, either from the legal team or from the tribunal, so it is hard to defend oneself.  On that particular issue, it has been said, although perhaps not touted, that the reason I did not want that out was that it would show there was a huge donation that I gave to Miriam in the contents.  That is just not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>A valid question was asked and I wish to ask it again because it should be answered more clearly.  Would we ever have found out about these payments or would the loans, as the Taoiseach describes them, have been repaid if <i>The Irish Times </i>had not found out?  On 18 February 1999 &mdash; six years almost to the day from when Senator Lydon got me in a headlock, which <Col N="1289"/>I remember very well &mdash; I asked the Taoiseach a question in the D&aacute;il.  It was: &ldquo;Has the Taoiseach been the beneficiary of any payment, contribution or gift from any source which, with the benefit of hindsight, he now considers to be unorthodox, unusual or irregular?&rdquo;  It was a straightforward question and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply &mdash; at least it was the nearest thing I can say to what was the reply &mdash; was: &ldquo;The Fianna F&aacute;il/ Progressive Democrats Government is clean of all these issues which have been thrown at us this week.&rdquo;  Can we have more clarity on that reply, given that it is somewhat wide of the mark?  Does the fact that the Taoiseach found that question unworthy of a clearer reply indicate that there were any other payments, including payments to support St. Luke&rsquo;s?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach says St. Luke&rsquo;s is political but there is a material benefit.  If I had a constituency office owned by the Green Party, I would not have to pay the rent.  It is important that we understand whether funding has gone to the Taoiseach directly or to St. Luke&rsquo;s.  Was that unorthodox, unusual or irregular, or does the Taoiseach see it as perfectly normal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>I would like to think that it does not just apply to me and that there are people in this House and elsewhere who, at times of difficulty, would be given loans by either family members or close friends.  That is not unorthodox or irregular.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said that he does not know who went with him to Manchester aside from Senator Kett.  However, he said there were other people with him.  The Taoiseach said he went with friends to Manchester on many occasions and that he is well acquainted with Irish organisations over there.  It is incredible that the Taoiseach cannot remember who went with him.  He said today it was a unique event in that he received &pound;8,000 sterling at it.  That would surely be clear in his mind, as well as the people who travelled with him.  Did the Taoiseach tell them that he had received the money that night?  How is it that nobody remembers it?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is clear about the number being 25, but he can only name two of them.  That is difficult to accept.  He knew all these people generally because he knows the Irish organisations and the football associates.  If he might not have known their names, he would have known that one of them must have had a big business.  Perhaps he was a publican, developer or a lawyer.  The Taoiseach would have to remember who was there; I cannot accept that he does not.</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach explain the role, if any, played by Mr. Richardson in each of the three payments he received?  In 1993 Mr. Richardson was appointed national fundraiser for Fianna F&aacute;il.  Was he at the Manchester function and did he raise money in Manchester, perhaps for Fianna F&aacute;il and not for the Taoiseach personally, on other occasions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My long-standing friend, Senator Tony Kett, was with me, as was Mr. David McKenna.  Over the 25 years I have gone to matches in Manchester, by and large the same group of people, not all of them friends of mine, would have travelled on the flights.  Most people would know the people who went.  Certainly, Senator Kett and Mr. David McKenna came with me.  I told Senator Kett that I received it and he made a statement about that previously.  Mr. Des Richardson was not with me.  Mr. Richardson was involved in the IR&pound;22,500 in December 1993 and was one of the contributors to it.  I gave the House the names of the contributors last week.  He was not involved in the second payment and he was not involved in Manchester.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1291"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach reminded the House that at the time he received these moneys he was a serving member of the Labour Party/Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  He said that the ethics and electoral Acts did not apply because they had not been enacted when he received the moneys.  He will recall that, over Christmas 1992, he and I were part of the negotiating team that agreed that Government&rsquo;s programme for government, which included those legislative measures.  He would, therefore, have known the standards that were expected of office holders in that Government, given that they had been agreed and set.</P>
        <P>Leaving all else aside, does the Taoiseach consider it acceptable for a serving Minister for Finance to have accepted &euro;60,000 for personal use?  The answer given is that it was not connected and that there is no proof of benefit given.  Would the Taoiseach not accept that this is a criminal standard of proof, that is, proof of a crime?  What is being asked here of members of Government, then as now, is not a criminal standard of whether he committed a crime but whether he had an acceptable standard for an officeholder when he knew what was set?</P>
        <P>I refer to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s contribution as leader of the Opposition to the debate after the resignation of former Minister, Deputy Lowry, when he set the standard that if it was alleged that any moneys given to a serving Minister were a loan, he would demand incontrovertible proof of the terms of the loan in writing at the time the loan was taken out.  In respect of the two sets of loans, details of which the Taoiseach has put on the record, is there incontrovertible proof that they were loans?  What terms and conditions were agreed?  Where is the written evidence of those conditions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Howlin put it as if it was a donation.  It was a loan I had to pay back with interest, so I did not receive the sum of &pound;60,000 as a donation.  I received two loans which I said I would pay back and I always intended to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Lowry affair, the Taoiseach said a loan is only a loan where there is incontrovertible proof.  Does that exist in his case?</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have also gone back and read what I said.  I said that one cannot associate oneself with business and with a company and say one is in business with or doing business with somebody and have &pound;200,000 &mdash; I mentioned the figure of &pound;200,000, although it subsequently turned out to be far more.  I was not dealing with business, with a contract for business&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1292"/>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not dealing with a business or doing business with a private sector employer of the size with which Deputy Lowry was.  I do not wish to make life difficult for the Deputy &mdash; that is not fair; it was many years ago &mdash; but the context was that it was a direct business engagement.  That is business and in business one tends to have contracts.  I had an arrangement with friends who were assisting me.  I could have done it with the bank and it would have been just as easy.  In fact, I did part of it with the bank and then reversed it later because I accepted their loan.  I would have paid the bank the interest and I paid them the interest.  In my mind &mdash; one can accept it or not &mdash; it is totally different.  I do not believe I have changed my position on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>To look at a different aspect of this, because there has been quite a lot of repetition, when does the Taoiseach believe the former T&aacute;naiste became aware of the questions that have confronted him in recent weeks?  Does he have any concern that she may have known of impending questions and that it might have, in some way, influenced her decision to vacate her role as T&aacute;naiste when she did?  Does he have any concerns in that regard as he has continued to ask questions as to from where this information may have emanated?  Why does he believe there is such a strenuous failure on the part of the former Progressive Democrats Deputy and now editor of<i> The Irish Times</i> to expose the source of the leak from the tribunal?  Is he aware that only one member of his Cabinet failed to applaud his contribution this afternoon?  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view on all this?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given that the Taoiseach complained about the leak of the information from the tribunal as forcefully as he did, is he prepared to condemn the abuse of his office by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he so happily leaked information to a journalist which was used to destroy the Centre for Public Inquiry?  Does he have double standards in that regard?  Does he not see the clear connection with leaks of the nature we are addressing?</P>
        <P>On the connection between his party and the other coalition party and big business, does he agree there are far bigger issues regarding that relationship than all that has been exposed in this episode?  I speak specifically about the cosy relationship that secured such a favourable arrangement for oil and gas exploration not only off the Mayo coast but elsewhere.  Given the mystery behind how Fianna F&aacute;il was so quickly able to deal with its massive accrued debt, would the Taoiseach like to tell us the extent of that relationship?  For instance, did Fianna F&aacute;il receive any contributions from Enterprise Oil, the people who initiated and hosted his first tent <Col N="1293"/>at the Galway Races?  What is the truth behind how quickly the Taoiseach was able to deal with all that?</P>
        <P>What are the full facts and truth behind the role of Ray Burke, as Minister with responsibility at that time, and others, including the Taoiseach, who must have been privy to the detail that allowed for such a cosy relationship where big business in the guise of these multinationals can ride roughshod over whole communities in this country?  Many serious questions need to be addressed and not only the detail in regard to the specific accusations now levelled at the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There was no connection between the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, moving from her position and these matters.  For many years we have worked hard to try to attract exploration and the handling of some of our natural reserves.  It is a long time since we set out terms to try to attract multinational companies to come to explore our seabed for exploration purposes.  We have changed those conditions a number of times.  Some Irish companies are involved in this business, which is good, as are some multinational companies.  It is totally wrong to make any connection between these and any political parties.  It  takes a huge amount of money to drill gas or oil holes and to be able to license and explore over many years.  I do not believe my party or any other party has been beholden to any of these interests at any time over the years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said he has done nothing wrong and he is not corrupt.  Does he accept he has damaged the image of our profession?  Last week in Cavan when asked a question about who collected the money and who organised it, the Taoiseach stammered and stuttered because he did not know the answer, yet after careful preparation over the past few days, he has come up with the name of someone who organised this but who cannot give us his account of what happened.  I find that hard to accept.  Did that information come from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s personal records or did he telephone a friend to find out?  How is he now so sure about who did that?  </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said he went to Manchester at his own personal expense.  How did he get to the airport?</P>

He was able to go to Manchester for six matches a year although he had no money.  Does the Taoiseach believe that they gave him money just because he is a nice chap?  As a clever person, does he believe, and does he expect us to believe, that these people handed over sums of &euro;500 or &euro;5,000, or those sums in sterling, for no other reason than that?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I have three questions for the Taoiseach.  First, as a matter of interest, who is this mystery man, Mick Collins, one of the donors or should I say lenders?  Perhaps the Taoiseach would give us some more information.  I know many journalists have been trying to identify him so perhaps the Taoiseach would tell us a bit more about him.</P><Col N="1296"/>
        <P>Second, earlier the Taoiseach made the point that he lodged the &pound;8,000 sterling he got in Manchester on the same occasion that he lodged the donation or loan of &pound;16,500.  Clearly, he has checked out these matters very carefully and given the fact that the Taoiseach lodged both amounts on the same day, can he tell us the date of that lodgment?</P>
        <P>Third, most people following this saga would find it impossible to imagine how somebody, not least a person who is Minister for Finance, could have functioned for six years without a bank account.  People are wondering about mundane things like what he did with his salary cheque, how he paid bills, where he had the &pound;50,000 in savings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1996, the Taoiseach, speaking after the McCracken tribunal report, said that the public is entitled to have absolute guarantee of the financial probity and integrity of their elected representatives, their officials, and above all their Ministers.  They need to know that they are under financial obligations to nobody other than public lending institutions, except to the extent that they are publicly declared.  Does the Taoiseach accept that he breached that standard which he set for politicians?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that I am under financial obligations to anybody.  I do not believe that by accepting a loan or accepting the donation in Manchester that I am under any obligation.  None of those people ever asked me for anything or put me under pressure for anything.  They are friends.</P>

Staying away from the topic we were discussing some minutes ago, a matter was brought to my attention where a tribunal has come to a conclusion on a particular issue.

    <Title>Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006: Second Stage. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, with its content covering a considerable spread of areas of the Statute Book, reflects to some extent the breadth of the functions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department.  Bringing forward this Bill gives the opportunity to propose changes to the law, each significant in its own way and some more substantial than others, which might not on their own always warrant the bringing forward of a stand-alone Bill but which are nonetheless necessary to improve the effectiveness of our legislation.</P>
        <P>A major proportion of the Bill addresses an area of considerable importance to the proper functioning of society, namely, the legal professions.  The rule of law is universally regarded as one of the foundation elements of any properly organised society.  It is that rule that defines relationships between private individuals or entities in society and between the State and those individuals or entities.  Because society, and relationships within society, have never been simple, the law has never been simple; but in today&rsquo;s increasingly complex society, the law too reflects that complexity.  That being the case, there has always been and will continue to be a need for experts in the law to advise and assist those who seek to invoke the law to assert or protect a right <Col N="1306"/>or to defend themselves against claims which they consider are not well founded.  The proper working of our society depends on there being a cohort of lawyers who make their services available to those involved, or potentially involved, in litigation.</P>
        <P>The legal profession has traditionally been organised in Ireland in two branches, solicitors and barristers, each largely self-regulating.  Part of that self-regulation has concerned itself with the maintenance of high professional standards and the investigation of allegations in particular cases that those high standards have not been met.  The procedures put in place by both branches of the legal profession to address this issue have evolved over the years and on the whole, the self-regulating processes operate satisfactorily.  There naturally remains, however, the possibility that a person who makes a complaint against a lawyer and gets a result from those processes that does not accord with his or her view of the matter will have a continuing sense of disgruntlement &mdash; a discontent not helped by the perception that the self-regulating process has favoured the professional over the complainant.  This perception can arise whether there has been actual bias in a particular case, and arises simply because the process is self-regulatory.</P>
        <P>That is where the proposals in Part 2 of this Bill come in.  That part is designed to establish a legal services ombudsman who will oversee the handling by the Law Society and the Bar Council of complaints by clients of solicitors and barristers.  The key functions of the legal services ombudsman include a form of review in particular cases for clients of solicitors and barristers who are dissatisfied with the handling of a complaint made to the Law Society or Bar Council, and a more general oversight role for those complaints procedures by examining a selection of complaints files each year taken on a random basis.</P>
        <P>To be effective and have the confidence of its users, any complaints mechanism must not only be, like Caesar&rsquo;s wife, above suspicion, but also be seen to be so.  The introduction of the legal services ombudsman as an extra overseeing layer to the present self-regulating mechanisms will provide the necessary independent scrutiny to assure the public of the effectiveness and trustworthiness of the complaints process as a whole.</P>
        <P>This Bill is not just about legal complaints processes.  As I have said, it gives an opportunity to make changes in a wide range of areas of the non-criminal law within the ambit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, not all of which would warrant the bringing forward of separate legislation, but where change is nonetheless desirable.  As well as an extensive range of technical changes in courts legislation, the Bill provides for various other matters involving changes in the law on business tenancies, statutory declarations, juries, bankruptcy and succession, and changes in gaming and lotteries legislation.</P><Col N="1307"/>
        <P>Turning to the detail of the provisions of the Bill regarding the legal services ombudsman, both the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council have complaints mechanisms in place.  The regulatory functions of the Law Society derive from the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2002, while the Bar Council&rsquo;s regulatory functions have no statutory basis.  The Law Society&rsquo;s complaints scheme is provided for under the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 and essentially caters for three classes of complaint: inadequate services, excessive fees and misconduct.  For example, following the controversy last year surrounding claims of overcharging by solicitors in respect of work before the Residential Institutions Redress Board, it is this complaints scheme that the Law Society has used in inviting persons to come forward with their claims.  The scheme is subject to independent oversight by the independent adjudicator established in regulations by the Law Society in 1997.  The legal services ombudsman will effectively subsume the existing office of independent adjudicator and carry out the same functions in respect of solicitors and barristers with changes.</P>
        <P>These changes include a requirement under section 13 for the ombudsman to report to the Minister within two years of being appointed on the effectiveness of the office and the adequacy of functions.  The ombudsman will under section 14 also oversee the admission policies of the legal professions and will be required to report annually to the Minister and the Oireachtas on the adequacy of numbers admitted to practise.  Under section 18, the costs of the office of the ombudsman will be funded entirely by a levy on the Law Society and the Bar Council calculated <i>pro rata</i> based on the numbers of practising solicitors and barristers.  In addition, the ombudsman has power at section 27 of the Bill to direct the Law Society or the Bar Council to re-investigate a complaint if not satisfied that the original complaint was adequately investigated, and by section 28 such directions are enforceable by the High Court.  The ombudsman also has power under section 31 to review the procedures of the relevant professional bodies for dealing with complaints, to examine both random samples of complaints and complaints relating to specific matters as well as making recommendations for improvements to these procedures.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s proposal for independent review of the operation of the legal professions complaints system by way of the legal services ombudsman is the way to proceed, consistent with the need for better regulation of the Irish system.  Self-regulation must achieve the highest standards of professional integrity for the protection of clients.  There is a public interest in ensuring a high level of confidence in the manner the professions regulate their affairs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Provisions in Part 4 amend the law in two further areas concerning the legal profession.  Both changes arise out of recommendations in <Col N="1308"/>the June 2004 report of the regulatory review task force chaired by Mr. Joe Brosnan, a former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The task force conducted a thorough review of the Law Society&rsquo;s organisation and practices.  Most of the recommendations of that report are being or have been implemented by the Law Society and do not need legislative change.  However, the remainder are dealt with in the legislation.  Both of the changes affect the complaints and disciplinary mechanisms of the Law Society.  The first is provided under section 53, which amends section 73 of the Solicitors Act 1954.  Section 73 deals with the committee structure of the society, which currently provides that a committee of the council of the Law Society may include solicitors who are not members of the council and also persons who are not solicitors; but two thirds of the membership of any committee to which powers of the council are delegated, or any quorum of the committee, must be members of the council.  The amendment in the Bill will have the effect of removing the two-thirds requirement and it also provides a significant shift towards further lay involvement in the make-up of the society&rsquo;s complaints and client relations committee.  The change will mean that a majority of that committee and any division or quorum of either must be non-solicitors.  The committee or any division of it is to be chaired by a solicitor.</P>
        <P>Section 54 amends section 8 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994.  This will enable the Law Society to direct a solicitor to pay a client a sum not exceeding &euro;3,000 as compensation for loss suffered as a result of providing inadequate legal services.  Such a payment made in compliance with the direction will be without prejudice to any legal right of the client.  The amendment also enables the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to vary the amount by order, no more frequently than at two-year intervals, to reflect the rate of inflation.</P>
<P>Part 3 deals with courts and court officers. Section 39 replaces section 65 of the Courts of Justice Act 1936, dealing with the setting of court fees. The Act provided that the Minister may prescribe court fees and the persons by whom and the occasions on which such fees are to be paid. This power remains with the Minister; but under the new provision, the minutiae of the manner in which such fees are to be collected are to be left to the Courts Service, the independent agency established in 1999 to take care of the running of the courts.</P>
        <P>The Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002 reduced the qualifying age period for pensions for public servants from five to two years with effect from 2 June 2002 but that did not extend to judicial pensions.  Sections 40, 41 and 42 reflect this change with regard to judges.  These sections deal with pension provisions for judges of the superior courts, Circuit Court and District Court, respectively, who retire on age or infirmity grounds <Col N="1309"/>before having served long enough to gain entitlement to a full pension.  Currently, no pension is available unless a judge has served a minimum of five years.  Under the new provisions, a judge who retires on age grounds after a minimum of two years will be entitled to a pension based on the number of years served.  The minimum period of service of five years will continue to apply where the retirement is on grounds of infirmity.  I understand from the Department of Finance that the revised arrangements have been in place for judges on an administrative basis since 2002 and these provisions put the arrangements on a statutory footing.</P>
        <P>Section 43 makes two amendments to the Eighth Schedule of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961.  The first amendment aims at ensuring regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972 may confer functions on the Master of the High Court.  Such powers may only be conferred by primary legislation or by rules of court.  The Master of the High Court has an increasing role to play, at the preliminary stage, in a number of EU instruments in the civil and commercial areas.  Such EU instruments are generally given effect in law by regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972.  A recent High Court decision found that because of the present wording of the Eighth Schedule to the 1961 Act, a provision in regulations under the 1972 Act purporting to confer jurisdiction on the master was ineffective.  The amendment will remedy this.  An amendment to provide similarly in respect of county registrars is in preparation and will be brought forward at a suitable point in the Bill&rsquo;s progress.</P>
        <P>The second amendment in section 43 alters the qualification requirements for appointment as registrar of wards of court.  Currently, the appointee must be a barrister of either ten years practice or, if serving in the offices of the Supreme Court or High Court, 12 years&rsquo; experience in those offices.  A minimum of nine years&rsquo; service in one of those offices for a serving officer of the Courts Service  or such other service, as the Courts Service with the consent of the President of the High Court thinks fit, is the new requirement. Section 52 similarly proposes to alter the qualifications requirements for appointment as examiner and probate officer.  These changes allow for appointment of persons to the positions concerned from within the Courts Service generally, as distinct from the more restricted areas of that service provided in each case.  The changes arise out of, and reflect, the unified organisation and structure of the Courts Service under the Courts Service Act 1998.  At the same time, the specification by the Courts Service of the qualifications for appointment to the posts of examiner and probate officer recognises the need for appropriate expertise on the part of appointees.</P>
        <P>Section 44 amends section 5 of the Courts Service Act 1998, dealing with the functions of the Courts Service to encompass functions that <Col N="1310"/>may be created for the service by future statutes.  Section 45 amends section 6 of that Act to cover the provision of support services to the rules committees of the superior courts, the Circuit Court and the District Court arising out of the changes made in sections 46, 47 and 48 of the legislation.  Those sections draw together and restate the provisions of the various Courts Acts regarding the composition of the superior courts, Circuit Court and District Court rules committees.  A feature of these provisions is that they provide for the possibility of the secretaryship of the committees to reside in a central support unit within the Courts Service.  This follows a recommendation by the committee on court practice and procedure in its 28th interim report, that would enable the support unit to assist the committees more effectively.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Section 49 provides for the authentication of District Court orders by a District Court judge or District Court clerk other than the judge or clerk who was present when the order was made.  The same provision is made with regard to warrants issue by a District Court judge, other than a warrant issued on foot of sworn information.  The aim of the proposal is to allow greater flexibility in what can be an onerous and sometimes impossible task under the restrictions of the present law, particularly having regard to the large volumes of orders that can arise.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report is another catalogue of error, omission and waste.  We know the Comptroller <Col N="1312"/>and Auditor General has a technical job to examine Departments and so on.  However, we have had a catalogue such as this in each of the past five years.  I have no doubt citizens and taxpayers grow weary on hearing of them.  Each item catalogued by Mr. Purcell and his team is quite shocking to most people, like this afternoon&rsquo;s events, although not necessarily to those in the more rarefied atmosphere of upper Fianna F&aacute;il politics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The headline items in the report, such as the shambles made of the purchase of Thornton Hall, are of a scale that the word &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; is simply inadequate.  There is also the question of integrated ticketing, to which I will return, and the question of what has happened with regard to the health service, but most shocking of all is the deep-rooted indifference the Government displays to these reports.  Just as the Taoiseach this afternoon seemed able to weave a wide area between himself and normal ethical considerations so, in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, no one in the Government parties accepts responsibility.  No one resigns or is dismissed, and no one apologises to the D&aacute;il or the people, whose taxes fund these errors and mismanagement.</P>
        <P>The weary citizen is moved to protest but gets the cold shoulder for his or her trouble.  Like General Smuts, Fianna F&aacute;il sneers in thinly disguised contempt.  The dogs bark but the wagons carry on.  This sums up Fianna F&aacute;il and what we witnessed this afternoon.  It is the Fianna F&aacute;il attitude in a nutshell, in that the arrogance of long decades in power allows it to take a wholly casual line when auditors produce these case studies of waste.  It is just something that happens at this time of the year, which is forgotten in a few days and safely ignored forever.</P>
        <P>Why do we tolerate this attitude?  I looked at the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues this afternoon &mdash; it was a splendid picture.  Every one of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues has presided over some shambles or other, as listed in this or numerous other reports from the same source.  For example, in any genuinely accountable system, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, would have been shown the door years ago for the long list of policy and administrative failures he created, for example, the scheme for medical cards for the over 70s, which is way over budget, the PPARS episode or the nursing homes charges fiasco.  Yet he survives and even thrives and achieves promotion, and he sat in the middle of his colleagues today.  Deputy Martin may even become leader of his party some day, as the public memory of his woeful incompetence fades and the years pass, although Deputy Cowen may also have an interest in that position.</P>
        <P>Given that they have been in Government and, therefore, been driven around by official drivers and Garda drivers for nine years, it is easy to understand how Ministers forget what it is like to be a commuter or to have to collect a child from child care and to be stuck in traffic chaos, with <Col N="1313"/>no public transport available.  I understand how Ministers forget this, unless they have children who are commuters in that age group and hear it from them.</P>
        <P>The integrated system for Dublin that commuters and public transport users so desperately require has failed to materialise despite more than half a decade of promises.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reveals that the very large budget of &euro;29.6 million for this project is inadequate and that the project now requires &euro;42.7 million.  In March 2002 the RPA was given responsibility for developing an integrated ticketing system using smart card technology, so that people could transfer from the DART to buses or Luas, as is the norm in many European countries and throughout the world.  Ministers may have used public transport when abroad and therefore may have experienced this type of system.</P>
        <P>This system was to be delivered by 2005 for an agreed budget of &euro;29.6 million.  It is October 2006 and despite spending almost &euro;10 million on the project, we are no closer to implementation.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report concludes that approval of the revised budget of &euro;42.7 million represents the best value for money at this stage, presumably because having spent so much and committed so much, we cannot turn back.  In any event, an election will intervene and the Government will need something to tell enraged commuters.</P>
        <P>It defies belief that such a huge amount of money has been spent on this project over so many years without producing anything for taxpayers.  While developer friends of the Government, particularly friends of Fianna F&aacute;il, are making huge amounts of money from the new housing developments that sprawl around the edge of Dublin city, the Government cannot get its act together to provide an integrated transport system to transport new home owners to their jobs, usually in the morning, and back to their homes, usually in the evening.</P>
        <P>Even the existing plans fall far behind what is needed.  It has been clear for some time that the planned infrastructure for the west of Dublin, which is the main growth area, and the Leinster area is completely inadequate.  The census estimates of new population show the problem is far worse than was estimated.  For example, the major project for people living in north-west Dublin city is the development at Spencer Dock.  This development could reach Navan in County Meath rather than just Clonsilla and could ultimately reach Longford, Sligo and Westport in County Mayo.  This will allow greater capacity on the Maynooth line.</P>
        <P>However, the new Spencer Dock station is located 800 m from the proposed new pedestrian footbridge, leaving commuters with at least half a mile to walk to get to a central location on the southside of Dublin.  The distance is even further if one walks to Connolly Station through the bot<Col N="1314"/>tom of Sheriff Street.  Many people will not be anxious to walk late at night through dark city streets with a poor reputation.  It has been promised that the Luas may be extended to Mayor Street and provide some linkage.  However, without integrated ticketing, a commuter from Maynooth will be forced to get off the train and either buy separate bus tickets to get back to Connolly Station, take a taxi or buy a separate Luas ticket.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of how much the minimum Luas fare is but it is fairly significant.  The Minister could possibly ask his officials what is the fare.</P>
        <P>The integrated ticketing system seems to have fallen foul of inter-agency difficulties between Dublin Bus, CIE and private operators.  This undoubtedly has been partly caused by the confusion surrounding the management of this project and the political intentions of the Government, particularly those of the Progressive Democrats in respect of public transport in the greater Dublin area.  We know the Progressive Democrats have considerable reservations about the role of Dublin Bus in the commuter bus system.  The key failure highlighted in this report is the political infighting that leaves people in constituencies like Dublin West at the mercy of the nightmare of the M50 and the train from Clonsilla.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Minister has not yet had an opportunity to travel on this train but it is known locally as the Calcutta express because of the level of overcrowding which involves people hanging on for dear life.  We have embryonic bus lanes in developing areas in Dublin and west Dublin but due to political rows between the Minister and the Progressive Democrats, it has been impossible to get the additional buses to provide a service on these lanes.  Again, the issue is where the buck stops.  Does it stop with some junior civil servants who simply cannot end the impasse between the different agencies?  Alternatively, does it stop with a Minister or the Government collectively?  The Minister has been unable to give us an answer.  As we heard this afternoon, his defence is bound to consist of one excuse after another but he should tell this to the commuters facing a journey to work of two or more hours each day and a further two-hour commute<?oasys _jy ?>home.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must answer very serious questions arising from the special investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General into the acquisition of the Thornton Hall prison site.  Spending on this site was sanctioned on the condition that procurement guidelines had been strictly followed, yet the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office indicates that this was not the case.  Chapter 4 of the report supports many of the main criticisms of the deal.  It is clear that the Government paid at least twice the market rate for the land in handing over &euro;30 million for the site.  It acquired 50 acres more <Col N="1315"/>land than was needed at the excessive price of &euro;200,000 per acre and did not pay sufficient attention to secondary costs, such as developing access routes and public access to the site.  I know the Minister cannot know where Thornton Hall is but the area possesses completely inadequate road infrastructure and is served by one bus per day, which leaves early in the morning and returns late in the evening.</P>
        <P>The report indicated that the detailed evaluation criteria for comparing sites that was laid out on paper was not applied.  Factors such as road access were not taken into account.  Cost was given an exceptionally low weighting as though it had no importance with regard to the decision.  The total cost was &euro;30 million, which was way over what it should have been.  The hiring of consultants to advise on site acquisition did not comply with procurement requirements laid out by Departments.  A total of &euro;310,000 was paid to consultants.  This should have been the subject of procurement tendering.  This episode shows the need to reform land acquisition so that sites can be properly evaluated, with considerations such as access and other facilities being accounted for during the purchasing process.</P>
        <P>Throughout the process, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform refused to answer questions from other Deputies arising from genuine concerns that the site was unsuitable and overvalued and that locating a super-prison in this rural location destroyed the possibility of strategic planning of development in the area.  The Minister refused point blank to answer the questions at the time and, reading this report, we now know why.  Again, the impulse behind developments at Thornton Hall seems to be ideological.  The Progressive Democrats want to close Mountjoy Prison not simply because it is an old-fashioned and inadequate Victorian prison, but because the new Thornton Hall prison will be a super-prison on an American scale and easily privatised down the road, should political circumstances allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do so.  I see the Minister for Finance is smiling but he will not be smiling too much when this happens.</P>
        <P>One of the regretful aspects of the Thornton Hall proposal is that as a result of the development of the new prison, the women&rsquo;s prison, D&oacute;chas, on which tens of millions have been spent and for which many female Deputies from all parties, including the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s own party, campaigned in this House, will be closed down.  Successive studies have shown the need for female prisoners to maintain access to and contact with their children when they are in prison if they are to be successfully rehabilitated.  A prison using this good model of penal practice, which has proved to be rather successful, is to be closed down to be replaced by this super-prison.  How are female prisoners&rsquo; families, including their children, supposed to reach Thornton Hall <Col N="1316"/>to visit them?  In practice, the only way the families of the type of people who end up in our prisons can visit them is by using a prison bus service and prison vans.  This means that families will face journeys to and from the prison in this van of over an hour each way.  This provides plenty of opportunities for criminal elements to lean on them as they see fit in respect of criminal activities within the prison, which is disgraceful.</P>
        <P>Regarding taxation, the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s predecessor stated many times that there was no hidden pot of gold from people who did not pay their fair share of taxes.  It is interesting to note that this report states that the investigations into life assurance products have already yielded some &euro;398 million and are expected to yield another &euro;100 million.  This again proves some people in society are determined and prepared to take the chance that tax evasion will work for them.  Why can they do this?  The report shows that the number of audits carried out by the Revenue Commissioners fell from 16,321 in 2004 to 14,214 in 2005, which represents a decrease of 13%.  Therefore, people who want to evade tax do not have to worry too much about Fianna F&aacute;il being on their case.  Despite a construction boom that has lasted ten years, the Revenue Commissioners have only recently begun to examine tax compliance in the construction sector.  There are people who fail to pay taxes and thereby rob our schools and hospitals, yet single people on PAYE are forced to pay tax at 42% on &euro;32,000 should they be fortunate enough to get a bit of overtime.</P>
        <P>Last year there were only 12 convictions for tax evasion.  That figure should be contrasted with the 256 prosecutions undertaken for social welfare fraud.  How much money was involved in the social welfare fraud?  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report it was &euro;1.3 million, yet tax evasion amounted to billions, as we know from the results of all the inquiries.  The problem is not failed civil servants but a Government that fails to take any sense of responsibility.  When crises arise it is always somebody else&rsquo;s fault, never the Minister&rsquo;s.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Comptroller and Auditor General once again on producing an excellent report, which is unique from a Government viewpoint in that there is no spin in it whatsoever.  It is straight up, fair, refreshing and tells it as one sees it.  It is important to take this opportunity to debate the report but, sadly, it has become a litany of Government failure and waste, which we are witnessing once again this year.  This <Col N="1317"/>time the taxpayer was asked to stump up double the cost of a site to build a prison, involving a hit of over &euro;15 million.  The taxpayer was also asked to stump up the cost of 30,000 phantom medical card holders.  The Government promised to provide 200,000 extra medical cards but this is the only sign so far of any extra cards.  Over a period of years, taxpayers have had to stump up &euro;20 million for 30,000 people who did not exist.</P>
        <P>In addition, we have had the continuing saga of integrated ticketing, which Deputy Olivia Mitchell will deal with later.  It is the longest running saga of its kind.  Sadly, a lot of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been lost week after week, amounting to &euro;10 million already on that project alone.</P>
        <P>All these projects, which have gone off the rails, are distinguished by the fact that they are pet projects of Ministers and driven by ministerial demands for action.  There is a problem with Ministers who clearly have an appetite for headlines when such projects are announced, yet do not seem to follow through by ensuring the systems put in place will deliver such projects efficiently and punctually.</P>
        <P>As we have heard from his colleague, I am sure the Minister will say this is a drop in the ocean and does not matter but I do not accept that for one minute.  This does matter because it goes to the heart of the way in which public money is spent.  If we tolerate it in these cases, we will be accepting a standard that is not good enough.  I examined the report on the prison site and it is unacceptable; the selection of consultants did not comply with the rules of procurement.  They dropped the site cost per acre from the evaluation scheme, which is a key issue for anyone conscious of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  They ignored the fact that they were in a unique position to use unzoned land, yet went instead for a public advertisement system which guaranteed they would go for the top price.  At that stage, the top price for land with potential was &euro;100,000 per acre but they paid twice that.  They paid almost full development land values, even though if they had handled it correctly they could have bought it for a much lower price at unzoned levels.  They bought more than they said they needed at the site ultimately decided upon.  They also entered into negotiations with just one buyer when the whole purpose of the system was to have multiple buyers and real competition in the market, which the Comptroller and Auditor General says compromised their position.  The report is a litany of how not to handle a project.  I think even the Minister, who will want to defend the T&aacute;naiste today, will accept in private if not in public that this is not good enough.</P>
        <P>The medical cards case is not acceptable.  This was driven by a budget day announcement &mdash; one of these rabbits that was produced out of the hat, providing medical cards for everyone over 70.  We know that project was not costed and the number of people and the cost were incorrectly estimated. <Col N="1318"/> They put themselves in an impossible negotiating position whereby they had to pay a huge amount for it.  Then they used a trailing issue of the new discretionary cards.  It is unclear where the information came from but they came up with a figure that 75,000 of these cards were provided because of exceptional medical circumstances.  They paid away merrily on the basis of those 75,000 but we now find in an audit that the database only shows 36,000 such cards.  Not even all of those cards were supposed to be compensated because they did not all come within the criteria for compensation.  Once again, we see the taxpayer being treated like a patsy or fall-guy who must take up all the slack and carry the cost of Ministers making announcements they did not think through in the first place.</P>
        <P>It is the same with integrated ticketing which has been in every programme for Government including the PDs and Fianna F&aacute;il, yet it still has not been managed as a coherent project.  One cannot escape the fact that Ministers have been at the heart of a consistent pattern of waste that is repeatedly coming to our attention.  The consistent themes involving Ministers include an abuse of procedures, which was clear in the case of the really big ones that attracted public attention, such as e-voting, Media-Lab Europe, Stadium Campus Ireland and Punchestown.  In every one of those cases the Comptroller and Auditor General found that Ministers abused the procedures under which projects were to be handled.</P>
        <P>The other major area &mdash; I hope the Minister does not do it this year &mdash; is producing rabbits out of hats on budget day which have never been properly costed and have never gone through any private consultation within Departments.  The high-water mark for that is decentralisation for which we will pay for many years to come because it was not planned.</P>
        <P>Another area concerns bad deals struck by Ministers who rush in to such projects.  We saw the former Minister, Deputy Woods, do it and we saw the former Minister, P&aacute;draig Flynn, do it with toll roads.  These approaches by Ministers need to be curbed and the only way to do so is by putting clear responsibility on the shoulders of those who commit to spending public money.  One of the pillars of the Fine Gael-Labour Party document is to hold Ministers responsible so they cannot wash their hands of responsibility when projects they have pushed through and have not properly controlled go wrong.  Ministers should not be promoted to something higher because they got such projects so seriously wrong.</P>
        <P>We can change that system which is dogged by decision making without taking responsibility.  There is a weakness in the follow up.  I admit the mismanagement of projects has been partly down to poor experience.  We have suddenly got into big public spending on infrastructural projects, yet have not until recently built up the expertise. <Col N="1319"/> I accept that some of the overruns were culpable because the Comptroller and Auditor General found there was a failure to do proper costings.  However, they could possibly be excused on the basis we did not have the expertise and were trying to do things too fast.  That cannot be accepted anymore, however, because we have been at this for a long time.  We are at a high level of capital investment and can no longer tolerate projects coming in so far over budget.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive set of reforms is required as regards the way we handle public money.  That point is at the heart of the Fine Gael-Labour Party document.  We must begin by reforming the gaping flaws in the way we formulate the budget.  It is not acceptable that the tax side is not subjected to scrutiny other than a once off scrutiny by the Minister.  That one-off investigation was scary to the extent to which huge sums had been committed, not only now but into the far distant future, which were yielding virtually nothing, in many cases, of commensurate value to the taxpayer.  That has to change.  We cannot have the discovery now and again of huge amounts of money gone down the tubes in tax schemes that have outlived their usefulness.</P>
        <P>We have to change also the horse trading that characterises the budget and estimation formation.  We must have systems where performance drives money and budgetary allocations and where Ministers take responsibility for performance when they get extra money.  The day they get &euro;200 million extra in their Estimate they must pin down exactly what is new and what they will deliver, and they should be held responsible.  We have to get to that level of accountability from Ministers in the way the budget is formulated.  The present system of phoney secrecy where the Estimates are produced at the end of November and the budget two weeks later, and the House packs up for Christmas after one omnibus vote does not pass as proper scrutiny of whether the decisions being made in the budget are the best ones for the taxpayer.  We have to get away from that system.  There are many changes that need to be made in the way we approach public spending.</P>
        <P>A decade has elapsed since the Public Service Management Act was passed when we had to have proper strategies, objectives and performance indicators, and we had to measure these.  The Minister would put his hand on his heart and say that has not happened.  There are no proper performance indicators for huge swathes of public spending.</P>
        <P>Recently I have looked at the area of crime.  The budget has been doubled in this area and yet the detection rate for serious crime has collapsed.  That is not Ministers being held accountable or using their budget formulation in a way that ensures the taxpayer gets value for money.  That has to change.  There is a need to put reforms in place to make that happen.</P><Col N="1320"/>
        <P>The Irish economy is rightly admired by many throughout the world.  We have pursued consistent policies from one Government to another.  There has been a pattern of consistent policy, protecting enterprise and ensuring that incentives are provided for enterprise.  That has been a great success.  There is the same opportunity to look at public service reform and to bring to it the same commitment to innovate, to fresh thinking and fresh management, the same openness and willingness to be held accountable for results that has characterised our success in other areas.  That is the next great mountain that has to be climbed by Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is not acceptable that  as one of the most wealthy countries we have to justify accident and emergency departments that do not work for people in serious need, and in the area of disadvantage that children ten years into programmes of so-called combating disadvantage are still as badly off, relative to their peers, as at the start of those programmes.  That belies a breakdown in the way we manage our public money and policies and form strategies, and what we accept as proper plans.  I believe there is political responsibility for this.</P>
        <P>On the last occasion this Government won office with all sorts of glossy plans for which there was no strategy whatsoever unpinning.  It has created this cynicism and underperformance culture that we have to live with.  There was no strategy to deliver and end hospital waiting lists by 2004.  There was no strategy to reduce waiting times in accident and emergency departments or to reduce class sizes to 20 or fewer for children of nine years and under.  Yet Ministers went out and said what they would do but there was nothing to underpin it and it did not happen.  We have to get away from that scenario and set higher standards for ourselves in politics in the way we handle public money.  That is one of the key themes that has to be addressed as we look to the next election.  I hope there will be a clear and resounding vote for a better way to deal with public money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My colleague, Deputy Bruton, dealt with a variety of issues, including the misspending of public money.  I shall deal solely with transport issues, a field that is strewn with over-spending, misspending, opportunity costs, from the bus lanes on which more than &euro;100 million has been spent, many of which are devoid of buses, the Dublin Port tunnel project which is coming in at probably the most expensive infrastructure project ever in Europe, the Aer Lingus debacle and the terminal at Dublin Airport where a decision must be made &mdash; the opportunity costs there are unknowable.  The actual costs of construction are greatly increased and still unknown.</P>
        <P>Against a background of the order of over-spending on these projects presided over largely by the Minister for Transport, no doubt the over-<Col N="1321"/>spending on integrated ticketing might appear minuscule to Ministers who have so much money that they consider millions of euro as small change.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on integrated ticketing is a sorry saga of pitiful public governance.  From the start the project was badly conceived, poorly supervised, inadequately supported and doomed to failure because of the absence of political commitment to the kind of framework necessary for its success.  The report makes it clear that the bottom of the problem was a political failure.</P>
        <P>Already &euro;10.5 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been spent and we have no card, smart or otherwise, and no early prospect of such a card.  The budget has gone from &euro;29.6 million to &euro;42.7 million and nobody knows where it will end.  The &euro;10.5 million already spent is dead money.  It makes no contribution and has been completely wasted.  We will have to start again.  More has been lost in the initial financial outlay of the &euro;10.5 million.  The opportunity cost of failure to deliver something promised as far back as 1997 by the then Minister, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, must also be factored in, as well as the inconvenience to the travelling public, the potential synergies that might have arisen in the actual integration growth of the transport systems from an integrated and co-operative ticketing system and the distraction and time wasted by the various actors and organisations involved in this whole unproductive exercise.  On all fronts this was an exercise in how not to do business and how not to manage public money.</P>
        <P>The project was precluded from success by the absence of political direction and political decisions about the future regulatory framework for public transport.  There were hints of what might happen in the future.  This resulted for everybody in complete uncertainty as to where they stood.  There were question marks over the existence of some of the organisations post the setting up of the promised Dublin Transportation Authority and none knew the extent or the nature of their future involvement in public transport delivery.  Small wonder then their reluctance to get involved in any particular ticketing system.  The Minister was well aware of the tensions between the players but continued to sit on his hands, refusing to give direction or comfort to those who were uncertain of their future role&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s fence sitting, there are also serious questions to be asked about the refusal of Dublin Bus to participate and co-operate in the implementation of a Government decision.  No matter what the excuses and irrespective of the motivation which may well have been bus users&rsquo; interests, the Government as a whole cannot allow this blatant rejection and ignoring of a Government decision by anybody, particularly semi-State bodies.  This sort of behaviour cannot go unquestioned and should be questioned by the Minister.  No public body can be allowed to subvert the implementation of Government policy, no matter how poorly articulated or overseen that policy has been.  </P>
        <P>Clearly there was a failure of co-operation, a failure to put partisan chip aside, but the big failure was at political level, first, by the refusal to clarify the future transport framework for Dublin and also by the Minister&rsquo;s failure to respond, take charge, ask questions or show any particular interest at any stage even when there were clear signals that disaster was glaringly obvious.  There were rumblings for a time but when the tendering system failed, a very unusual event, at that time surely the alarm signals should have gone off.  Instead the Minister came in here and in response to my questioning he shook his head in despair, tut-tutted at the lack of progress and generally behaved as if it had nothing at all to do with him.  In this Government&rsquo;s world it had nothing to do with him.  The buck never stops with the Government because it is not its buck.  It is not its hard earned money.  Not alone is it not just the taxpayers&rsquo; money, there is plenty more where that came from.  This is the attitude that pervades the Department of Transport and every Department &mdash; incompetence and indifference to wasteful public spending, a failure to plan, monitor and evaluate projects and a complete denial of any responsibility for any of the public service spending outrages that have been the hallmark of this Government.</P>
        <P>The public can forgive incompetence, but it will never forgive or forget the blatant denial, haughty indifference and dismissive arrogance of the Government&rsquo;s approach to people&rsquo;s hard earned money.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I propose to share time with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen.</P>
        <P>I will make some remarks of a general nature on the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report for 2005 to put it in context.  I intend to concentrate on the Government&rsquo;s reforms to public expenditure management and value for money initiatives, the actions taken by Government on tax evasion and on the Government&rsquo;s overall achievements in regard to public services.  My colleagues will, in the course of their contributions to this debate, deal with specific issues raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and with sectoral reforms and achievements in their areas.</P>
        <P>The 2005 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be put in the context of gross annual spend by central Government.  In 2005 gross expenditure by central Government on public services, including the social insurance fund, amounted to approximately &euro;45 billion.  Of this some &euro;15 billion was in respect of pay and pensions, over &euro;12 billion in respect of social welfare, &euro;12 billion in respect of health and &euro;7 billion in respect of education.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has long been a core part of the systems of oversight in this country.  There is a statutory requirement on him to report annually to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on his audit of departmental appropriation accounts.  His annual reports are exceptionally valuable, especially where they point to systems errors which should have prevented waste occurring.  I welcome his report as an important input into the ongoing process of ensuring better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>The 2005 report is not therefore some major new report on Government waste, but simply the comptroller discharging his annual function.  As Deputies are aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General reports are transmitted to the Committee of Public Accounts and form the basis for the questioning by the PAC of the Accounting Officers of each Department.  The report of the PAC is in turn remitted to me for comments and my comments are relayed back to the PAC after I have consulted the relevant Departments. This process enables the points made by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the PAC to be fully followed up and the necessary changes to be introduced to remedy any shortcomings.</P>
        <P>Poor management of public expenditure and occurrences of wasteful expenditure are not acceptable at any time.  The Government is determined to redress problems that come to light.  Nonetheless, promises that all instances of inefficient and wasteful expenditure can be totally eliminated are not realistic.  Is there a person or organisation, let alone a government, in the world who can honestly say that they have maximised the return from every cent of spending or every investment decision?  Of course not.  However, what we can and must do is have systems for <Col N="1325"/>planning and evaluation which minimise the risk of waste and maximise the chance of finding it when it occurs.</P>
        <P>While there have been problems and incidences of waste, the Government has continually sought to learn from those mistakes and we have been proactive in introducing measures designed to optimise value for money from public expenditure for the taxpayer.  A number of important initiatives have been put in place by the Government in recent years to secure this objective. These include the introduction in budget 2004 of rolling five-year multi-annual capital envelopes for better management and control of public expenditure programmes and projects; the publication in February, 2005 of new guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector; the additional value for money measures with regard to major projects, ICT projects and consultancies announced in October 2005; the introduction this year of new arrangements for expanded value for money policy reviews in place of expenditure reviews; recent reforms to the procurement of public construction contracts and reform and modernisation of the system for employing construction-related consultants; the introduction of the national public procurement policy framework for implementation by public bodies, in particular the development of corporate procurement plans that set targets for achieving savings and broad value for money objectives; the recent establishment of a central expenditure evaluation unit in the Department of Finance to promote best practice in evaluation and compliance by Departments and agencies with value for money requirements; and reforms to the Estimates and budget process announced in budget 2006.</P>
        <P>The objectives of these initiatives are to ensure that there is more effective and efficient allocation and management of resources by Government, Ministers, Departments and agencies, better value for money for the taxpayer and greater accountability to the Oireachtas and the public in regard to public expenditure policy and achievements for public expenditure.</P>
        <P>We are acutely conscious that we must get optimal return for the significant levels of capital investment we are committed to.  Currently we spend close to 5% of GNP on capital investment funded by central Government.  This is approximately twice the European average.  Public investment under the 2006-10 capital envelope will amount to over &euro;43 billion.</P>
        <P>The rolling five-year multi-annual capital envelopes with a 10% capital carryover facility is a common sense move which breaks the rigidity of the annual allocations system which undermined good planning.  Departments and agencies now have greater medium term budgetary certainty and more flexibility in planning and managing their capital programmes and projects.  We see the benefits of this.  They have general del<Col N="1326"/>egated responsibility for selecting and managing their capital programmes and projects within the framework of the capital envelopes, provided that they comply with my Department&rsquo;s guidelines for capital appraisal and public procurement and the other value for money requirements introduced last year.  The response by Departments and implementing agencies to the multi-annual capital investment framework has been uniformly positive.  This is being reflected in better project and programme management.</P>
        <P>The February 2005 guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector are designed to encourage a better approach to appraisal and management of capital programmes and projects and to reflect best international practice.  Key features of the guidelines are that all projects over &euro;30 million must undergo a full cost benefit analysis and small to medium projects must undergo an appraisal commensurate with their scale.  The capital appraisal guidelines contain all that is necessary to assist proper costing, appraisal and efficient execution of projects.  There are checks and balances built into the guidelines to ensure that projects are properly appraised and managed from project inception to procurement and post project review.  Sponsoring agencies and Departments must carry out preliminary and detailed appraisal of all projects and seek approval of the relevant sanctioning authority before proceeding through the key stages from appraisal to planning and implementation.</P>
        <P>The guidelines explicitly state, as part of the appraisal process, that &ldquo;the cost of the project should be the expected outturn cost, including construction costs, property acquisition, risk and contingency&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the cost of possible future price increases and variations in project outputs should be factored into the calculation of project costs&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The value for money initiative which I announced in October last includes a number of important measures to promote better accountability at project level.  It is now a specific requirement for all major capital projects and ICT projects that an individual project manager must be appointed who is responsible for managing and monitoring project progress and for reporting progress to a project board.  There must be regular reporting of progress on capital programmes and major projects and value for money generally to the management advisory committee of Departments and to boards of State agencies.  The objective is to ensure that problems arising are brought to notice and dealt with at an early stage.  A further innovation is that details on progress on project outcomes against budgets and scheduled completion dates for projects above &euro;30 million must be included in departmental annual reports on their statements of strategy.</P>
        <P>Departments are also required under the new value for money arrangements now in place to <Col N="1327"/>report annually to my Department on progress under their capital envelopes.  They must include, as part of that reporting requirement, an account of progress on major capital projects and compliance with the general conditions of my Department&rsquo;s delegated capital sanction and the capital appraisal guidelines, including details of spot-checks for compliance carried out by them.</P>
        <P>I have recently established a central expenditure evaluation unit in my Department.  It will have a key role in promoting best practice on appraisal and evaluation generally and in ensuring compliance by Departments and agencies with the capital appraisal guidelines and other requirements under the enhanced value for money framework now in place.  The unit will review the annual reports from Departments to my Department in regard to compliance with capital appraisal and value for money requirements.  The objective is that deficiencies in Departments and agencies with regard to project management and value for money are identified and, more generally, to facilitate more systematic engagement between my Department and Departments and agencies in taking any necessary corrective action.</P>
        <P>With regard to ICT projects, a formal peer review process for major projects is also in operation.  The peer review is carried out at key decision points, preliminary business case assessment, detailed assessment, pre-tender, post-tender, and project close-out, by a team of experienced people external to the project board and the organisation.  In 2005, I also introduced, the national public procurement policy framework.  The aim of the policy is to encourage strategic change in public sector procurement by improving the procurement process in public sector organisations.  Under the procurement framework each public sector organisation is required to develop and implement an individual corporate procurement plan.  The plan must include an overview of existing procurement expenditure, procedures and processes, a set of high level procurement goals and a detailed breakdown of the process for implementing each goal.  These target driven measures will help improve procurement processes, policies and procedures across the service and will result in better value for money outcomes to procurement.</P>
        <P>The Government has introduced significant reform to the public construction contracts regime to achieve greater cost certainty and cost effective and timely delivery of public capital works projects.  My Department has now completed a suite of five new forms of construction contracts for civil and engineering and building works and, for the first time, put in place standardised public sector conditions of engagement for construction consultants.  The new contractual conditions are focused on transferring identifiable risk to contractors to allow tendering <Col N="1328"/>for capital works projects on a lump sum fixed price basis for three years.</P>
        <P>The conditions of engagement for consultants are structured and balanced in a way that incentivises more efficient and effective consultant performance to better protect the public sector client&rsquo;s interest.  The conditions also change the fee payment mechanism by introducing competitive fee bidding but allowing quality to remain a key award criterion for quality-dependent projects.</P>
        <P>The new contracts and conditions of engagement will be applied with effect from January 2007.  Prior to this, an intensive training programme will be undertaken to ensure public sector clients are fully familiar with the new contractual terms and conditions.  The new contractual conditions for contractors and consultants are a key element in the drive towards greater value for money from capital works projects over the medium to longer term.</P>
        <P>As part of its ongoing commitment to reform and building a robust management and value for money assessment framework, the Government decided to replace the expenditure review initiative with new arrangements for value for money policy reviews.  These arrangements which I announced on 11 June last, build on the value for money reforms already in place, such as the multi-annual capital envelopes, the revised capital appraisal guidelines and the procurement reforms.</P>
        <P>A programme of 90 value for money reviews has been agreed for Departments for the period 2006-08.  I am determined that what I accept has been a poor record with regard to the timeliness of completion of reviews under the earlier round of reviews will not occur on this occasion.  In addition, to address criticisms about the scale and nature of the topics reviewed under the former expenditure review process and to ensure greater accountability, the value for money reviews being undertaken by Departments in the period will, as a general rule, have a minimum indicative coverage of at least 10% to 15% of Departments&rsquo; budgets.  The completed reviews will also be published and submitted to the relevant Oireachtas select committees for their consideration.  I hope the committees for their part will take an active interest in the reviews and will engage with Departments in assessing their impact on value for money for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>My announcement of last June also encompasses reviews which impact on value for money but which are not part of the formal value for money policy review initiative.  There are many instances of dedicated reviews and studies carried out by Departments which impact on value for money.  Henceforth, details of all such reviews will generally be made available to the relevant Oireachtas committee and copies of the reviews will generally be given to the committee.</P><Col N="1329"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s reform of the Estimates and budgetary process which I announced in budget 2006 will significantly enhance accountability for public expenditure.  From 2007, Ministers will be required to submit an annual output statement to the Oireachtas in tandem with their Estimate.  This statement will set out the target outputs of Departments and agencies for the resources provided in their Estimates and, from 2008 onwards, Ministers will report progress on performance as compared with targets.  The performance information which the annual output statements will contain will enable the select committees and citizens to see what outputs are being achieved for public expenditure.  All Departments are currently actively engaged in the process of producing their outputs statements to meet next year&rsquo;s deadline.  I envisage the process will be developed and refined in the light of its operation.</P>
        <P>Under this reform, the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, taking account of the deliberations of the various select committees, will submit a report on expenditure to the House.  This report can be an input into subsequent Government consideration of the expenditure Estimates for the following years.</P>
        <P>The above package of measures marks a major move towards ensuring that we at least match international best practice in achieving value for money and better accountability for public expenditure.  These measures refute the alleged inaction as set out in the Opposition motion.  Following a review by my Department of tax reliefs and exemptions, I introduced significant changes in the budget and the Finance Act 2006, to curtail the potential for individuals to reduce their net liability for tax by using tax reliefs, including a restriction on the use of specified tax reliefs by high income taxpayers.  The restriction will come into effect from 1 January 2007.  The list of specified reliefs includes various property-based tax incentives and certain other reliefs such as the business expansion scheme, film relief and donations.  Tax exemptions, including artistic income, stallion fees, and patent royalties will also be subject to this restriction.</P>
        <P>The aim of this new restriction is to try and get the balance right between promoting tax equity in relation to those on high incomes while at the same time maintaining the incentive effect of the various tax reliefs introduced to achieve a particular public good.  The measure is being introduced with effect from 1 January 2007 to allow sufficient time for individuals affected by the restriction and their tax advisers to become familiar with the operation of the restriction.  It is estimated this restriction will yield &euro;5 million in 2007 and &euro;50 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>It is important the record is set straight with regard to achievements for the expenditure applied by this Government.  It is very easy for the Opposition to play politics with this area in an attempt to undermine Government achieve<Col N="1330"/>ments by singling out individual instances of waste for mention or by making exaggerated claims that expenditure on programmes is wasted if any part of it showed waste, or that the failure to solve every problem means there has been no progress on delivering services.  The vast bulk of all public expenditure provides real value for money and delivers essential services and a good return for the taxpayer.  Every day this expenditure is effectively delivering significantly important services to our citizens.  Over &euro;50 billion will be spent this year and social welfare, health, education and capital investment will account for almost 80% of that expenditure, bringing significant improvements.</P>
        <P>The Opposition has complained that no progress is being made on the long waiting lists.  It is the case that for some operations the waiting lists have shortened from five years to five months.  We have built record numbers of schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>A significant amount of resources have been invested in providing for people with disabilities and in placing them in mainstream education.

The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report to this House, as is the case for every Government of every composition, points out where we can do better and where we need to do better.  The important point is whether we put in the systems of accountability that minimise the chance of risk and whether we can <Col N="1331"/>ensure that we have the systems in place to enable us to make the sort of progress which taxpayers can rightly expect from the huge sums of money being invested in public services with real returns and real results.  </P>

	<P>I am happy to participate in this debate and to deal with issues which are of significant national importance and which concern the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I opened the Fermoy bypass which has been completed eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.  This bypass will remove 17,000 vehicles each day from Fermoy town centre and will reduce journey times by up to 30 minutes.  The Fermoy road opening is not an isolated event but rather is typical of what is happening on the national roads network, nationwide, on a weekly basis.  This is known by all colleagues from all sides of the House because they all turn up, along with all their councillors, to welcome these projects which transform and have a significant impact on people&rsquo;s daily lives.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway was delivered ten months ahead of schedule.  The Dundalk bypass was also opened ahead of schedule.  To date in 2006, nine projects have already been delivered on time and within budget.  They include the Cavan bypass, the Enniscorthy-Clonroche realignment, the Ashbourne M50 bypass, the Ballyshannon-Bundoran bypass, the Edgeworthstown relief road, the Naas road widening, the Mitchelstown relief road and the Castleisland-Abbeyfeale project.  All these projects are on budget and ahead of schedule.  As can be seen from the spread, the projects being delivered affect every part of the country.  It is not just roads that are being developed.  The Luas project is a tremendous success and improvements to the DART and the intercity rail services are making a real difference to public transport.</P>

It is interesting that this is the first Government in Europe to set out and recognise that investment in heavy infrastructure requires a long-term view to bring certainty to the market and deliver projects well ahead of schedule and on budget.

	<P>Has the Minister taken the bus to Thornton Hall?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue, to which the Deputy referred, I was very pleased to have concluded all the negotiations in recent days and to have brought a very strategic, important and fundamental reform package to Government, which will at last remove the 1932 Act, provide 100 buses for passengers and commuters in Dublin, provide 160 buses to Bus &Eacute;ireann for the regions throughout the country, and, for the first time, allow for a Bill to be brought to Government shortly that will allow the private sector to participate in on-street delivery of buses, thereby expanding the bus fleet in Dublin and throughout the country.  That is the sort of progress that would not be possible for Fine Gael and Labour to make.  All the bleating in the world will not change that fact.</P>
        <P>There has been considerable success in recent years in managing the delivery of public transport projects.  No major CIE projects have had cost overruns in the recent past, with a number of projects including the Heuston Station project, the DART upgrade project and the Drogheda railcar depot coming in under budget.</P>
        <P>A group responsible for the high-level monitoring of Transport 21 on a national basis has been established.  The group comprises representatives of the Departments of Finance, Transport, the Taoiseach and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the National Finance Development Agency.  The CEOs of Transport 21 implementing agencies attend the meetings as invited.  In the first year of implementation, considerable progress has been made in advancing the two key strategies of Transport 21, namely developing a high quality national roads and public transport network together with transforming the transport system in the greater Dublin area.  I have already dealt with the roads programme.</P>
        <P>In Dublin, the public transport system is well on the way to being transformed with substantive progress on the two metro lines, the seven Luas projects, the Kildare route project, the Navan line project and the new Dublin Docklands station.  Nationally, heavy rail projects such as the western rail corridor, the Cork commuter rail project, the intercity rolling stock replacement programme and the Portlaoise railcar depot have all been progressed.  Public consultation on metro north commenced earlier this year and is at a very advanced stage.  The RPA is in discussions with the local authorities and developers regarding exact route options for metro west.</P>
        <P>The green Luas line from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to Sandyford will be extended to Cherrywood and Bray.  The railway order for the Cherrywood extension has been granted and construction will commence in 2007.  Public consultation on route options for the extensions to the Bray environs <Col N="1335"/>has commenced.  The green line will also be extended northwards to interchange with the red line in the centre of the city and onwards to Liffey Junction where it will interchange with the Maynooth and Navan line.  This has the potential to add another 7 million passenger journeys to the Luas each year as a result of simply connecting the lines.  The greater impact will come when metro north comes into being and all these significant methods of public transport will interact and interchange with each other.</P>
        <P>There will be fundamental roles for bus, light rail, the DART system with the interconnector and the impact of metro north and metro west on our great capital city.  The red Luas line will be extended to the Dublin Docklands and also to City West and we have progressed that development.  I expect to make a decision shortly on the railway order for the Dublin Docklands extension, which is scheduled for completion in 2008.  Public consultation is ongoing on the City West extension and the RPA is expected to lodge a railway order application for this in early 2007.</P>
        <P>Considerable developments are also taking place on the heavy rail network.  I recently agreed to grant a railway order for the Kildare route project and the text of this order is being finalised.  The project will double the number of tracks to four between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch on the Kildare rail line which will allow for two dedicated tracks for commuter services and two for intercity and other suburban services.  Many new stations will be added, for example, at Adamstown, Lucan, Balgaddy and Park West.  It will give greatly increased capacity on the Kildare commuter services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The western rail corridor project was launched last week and involves the phased opening of the rail lines in Ennis, County Clare, and Claremorris, County Mayo.  I approved funding for phase 1 from Ennis to Athenry and phase 2 from Athenry to Tuam.  Works are due to commence in 2007.  Phase 3 from Tuam to Claremorris is scheduled to go to planning shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Intercity rolling stock replacement programme involves the purchase by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann of 217 new rail carriages to replace the current fleet.  We are replacing the entire Intercity fleet.  Four or five years ago, who would have believed that by 2008 we would have the most modern railcar system of any European country?</P>

	<P>And the slowest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a real demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment in recent years.  The only thing that is slow around here is the voice of the Deputy opposite who seems to be determined to talk to the ether for the evening.  Inevitably, in a small number of projects difficulties occur.  The integrated ticketing project was conceived as a multi-operator system of integrated public trans<Col N="1336"/>port, using smart card technology with initial deployment in the Dublin area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it like e-voting?  The Minister is unlucky with computers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all.  It is pathetic to listen to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be something about the Minister and electronics that do not go together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Integrated ticketing projects are recognised to be inherently complex and difficult to implement in a multi-operator environment.  When particular difficulties became apparent as they did when I came to the Department, I took immediate action to bring together the parties, the Railway Procurement Agency and Dublin Bus as the principal operator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knew about electronics from his previous Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should go and buy herself a train and track set to keep her happy.  These projects were sent out for review and the two reviews completed in April and May, respectively, considered the options of abandoning, mothballing or continuing the project and recommended continuing.  Both reviews strongly endorse the continuation of the project, subject to enhanced governance arrangements being put in place.  In July, I notified the Government that I would proceed with the project on the basis of enhanced governance arrangements and, in particular, the establishment of an integrated ticketing board under an independent chairperson who would be accountable to me.  In the coming days, I expect to receive the first progress report from the chair of the integrated ticketing project board.  Members should acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s foresight in introducing smart card technology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Was that like electronic voting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>People keep coming to me with outdated paper ticket technology or to make reference to Hong Kong and Singapore.  Members should be aware that the integrated ticketing system in Hong Kong, which uses smart card technology, took ten years to implement at a cost of &euro;250 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not augur well for Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The expertise we have brought to bear on the integrated ticketing system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Were the people responsible for PPARS involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, the Deputy opposite does not frequently use public transport in this <Col N="1337"/>city or she would be aware that the first phase of the integrated smart card ticketing system is already working successfully on the Luas.  Of course, that is ignored by a Labour Party which, with Fine Gael, said Luas was a waste of time and would never be delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think they will remind the people of Dublin, when they are canvassing in next year&rsquo;s general election, of their lack of commitment to and investment in public transport.  The speeches made by the Ministers for Finance and Transport in the rainbow Government made hardly any reference to investment in public transport.  They ignored the fundamental basis of travel within a modern society, namely the necessary infrastructure for commuter and intercity travel.  Through the good offices of the Minister for Finance, the Government will continue to win the confidence of the Irish people in spite of the failures of the parties opposite when they were in power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share time with Deputies Durkan and Twomey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>The theme of today&rsquo;s D&aacute;il debates was money.  All day, we listened to somebody who had no money and now we are discussing somebody who had money but did not know how to spend it.  The person in the best position of all is the Minister for Finance, who discovered today that we have lots of money.  We have just heard the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, speak about all that has been done.  The Minister for Finance might consider sending a few euro to east County Meath to build a few schools for the children of the area or a hospital for their parents and the Slane bypass might be put on the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s desk now rather than leaving it until 2008.</P>
        <P>The manner in which money was obtained by individuals in this House and the way in which money was spent on buying a farm in north County Dublin as a prison site were both wrong.  The farm was valued at &euro;6 million and would be worth a maximum of &euro;8.9 million if it was zoned, which was unlikely given that it lay on the borders of County Meath.  The Government ended up paying an extra &euro;15 million for it, money which could have gone a long way in other areas if it was not improperly spent.</P>
        <P>I have only been here for 15 months but I learned a great deal last week.  Certain matters have not changed since I was a young fellow.  The Government sent a man to north County Dublin to pick out a farm and told him not to ask for more than &euro;200,000 per acre but the deal had to be signed regardless of what was found.  In ten <Col N="1338"/>years&rsquo; time this issue will come before another tribunal inquiring into the scandalous waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  How can we get these people, who say they have so much money, to carry out their duties properly?</P>
        <P>No consideration has been given to the school adjacent to the site and we now believe there is no intention to change the direction of the road leading to it.  In an emergency, how will we protect the children in that school?  We should not think nice people will be living in that place because we have seen down the years the types of people who are incarcerated.  They are in prison for a reason, and it is out of order to build a prison near a school.  There is no infrastructure in terms of water, sewerage or roads in the area and the installation of these facilities will come at great expense merely to provide a prison for people who do not want to behave themselves.  Why did those responsible for the purchase of these lands not manage the money properly?  No farmer would put a premium on land he or she wanted to purchase.</P>
        <P>Fair dues to the individual who received &euro;30 million for the land.  I have no grudge against him and hope the matter works out for him and his family.  However, while it is clear that a prison requires to be built, why pick an area with very few people?  The land is situated on the border of County Meath, so the Government thought the objectors would be divided.  Fortunately, objections will be made because very good people live in the area and they have discovered the faults in the deal.</P>
        <P>One enters politics in the hope that mistakes will not be repeated.  This matter was probably one of the first I encountered and the manner by which it was addressed stinks to high heaven.  I have no doubt that the truth will come out in ten years&rsquo; time because it always does.  I suppose there will be no going back but how much will it cost and why was the project not managed properly?  Why do we have to end up before tribunals?  Why can people not be straight?  One does not enter politics for the job but to do a job.</P>
        <P>As a nation, we had a good name internationally but we have destroyed that today with the prison and because we allowed this Government to continue.  This prison should not be built.  People should not throw in the towel but should fight because they know it is wrong.  They know it is not right to build a prison beside a school and that &euro;15 million is too much to spend on the site.  The Members opposite never seem to admit when they are wrong, with the result that in ten years&rsquo; time, we will be still fighting over tribunals.  Both of the money matters discussed today were wrong.  Those in positions of responsibility should not take money, and money belonging to the public should not be spent unwisely.</P>

	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion, which I fully support.  As <Col N="1339"/>someone who spent a number of years on the Committee of Public Accounts, I regard the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General as being of critical importance.  That committee is probably the only one with the resources necessary to undertake investigations of spending throughout the public sector.  The Minister for Finance offered the services of other committees, such as the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  Unfortunately, those committees do not have the resources required to delve deeply enough into expenditure at that level.  However, the Committee of Public Accounts does and has done a tremendous job.  That applies to the staff and all involved with that committee over the years.</P>
        <P>I smiled as I listened to the Minister, Deputy Cullen, recount all the good deeds that have been done.  One simple matter that was mentioned earlier is e-voting.  The issue with e-voting is not only the &euro;50 million or &euro;60 million spent but the contempt with which the Government proceeded to spend more and more money with no regard for what was happening.  It also spent money on public relations exercises in an attempt to teach the public to use the machines, despite the fact that there was ample evidence in the public domain to the effect that the machines would not work.</P>

	<P>What is the Deputy&rsquo;s problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The forward planning for that tunnel was amazing.  Public money was being spent so nobody cared a damn about it.  It was only public money.  Four years ago I put down a parliamentary question asking how the traffic would be funnelled into the port tunnel.  There was a massive snigger from the Government; funnelling was not on its mind.  However, funnelling is the issue.  The N11, N7, N9, M4 and other roads around the city will have to funnel traffic into the port tunnel, which is not high enough to accommodate super trucks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it Fine Gael policy to allow super trucks in this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ultimately, the soon to be upgraded M50 will have trucks parked on it all day attempting to get into or out of the port tunnel.  I have never seen anything like it.</P>

A total of &euro;160 million has been spent to date and there is an &euro;11 million cost every year to pay 30,000 people.  A cost-benefit analysis should be carried out on that system.  The iSoft project is another which looks ready to collapse at any time.  The HSE is not working.  The Government reads too much of its own spin but the HSE is falling apart.  It will not fall apart before the general election so the Government will be saved from that.</P>

	<P>There is no need to interrupt me.  Every major Government project costing more than &euro;30 million is supposed to be subject to a cost-benefit analysis.  Has a cost-benefit analysis been carried out on the new home care projects that have become part of the privatisation process of the health service?  Given that a home care package includes 13% VAT and assuming the private company makes 10% or 12% profit, is the Minister certain that it is more competitive for the HSE to give that job to a private company?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a far greater issue.  The Minister has a privatisation agenda as well so perhaps he might explain something else to the House.  It is proposed that approximately six new private hospitals be built on the grounds of public hospitals.  The Government&rsquo;s policy is to sell off public land for an unknown price, give &euro;400 million in tax concessions and take &euro;1 billion from the public system and hand it over to the private sector.  Has there been a cost-benefit analysis of such a huge transfer of money within the health service from the public to the private sector?  It is up to &euro;1.4 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I supported the building of the new private hospital which will open shortly in Waterford and I never looked for public lands.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I am asking the Minister.  Does the Minister know if a cost-benefit analysis has been carried out?  The Minister supported what he knew nothing about; e-voting was a perfect example of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be worth the Minister&rsquo;s while to examine why these six hospitals are being built.  Over the last 20 years in this country no more that seven such hospitals have been constructed.  Why have 36 submissions been made for these hospitals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it reasonable to announce tomorrow that Fine Gael does not support the radiotherapy services?  Is that the new position?  The Deputy&rsquo;s Fine Gael colleagues in Waterford will be shocked to hear what the Deputy has said in the D&aacute;il tonight.  If that is the view of Fine Gael, I might as well make it public tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should know what my policies are; he need not ask me about them tonight.  To ensure the proper delivery of a radiotherapy service in the south east, that radio<Col N="1344"/>therapy unit should have been built on the grounds of Waterford Regional Hospital where the other oncology and surgical services are available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is complaining about it now; he does not want it.  The Deputy should make up his mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister disagree with the multidisciplinary delivery of health services?  The Minister is the one who should listen.  He is poorly informed.  He is driven by a silly agenda and is not prepared to move sideways from it.  The best place for that radiotherapy unit would have been on the grounds of Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I do so I would like to say that the Minister is totally lost in regard to what is going on here.  Patient care is being seriously compromised by some of the Government&rsquo;s polices.  The Minister is ignorant of what I am talking about and he cannot even listen.  I was talking about a private hospital and not about radiotherapy.  He is totally confused.  </P>

	<P>I wish the Minister, Deputy Cullen, would wait to listen to what is happening to the health service because I would be able to tell him.</P><Col N="1345"/>
        <P>There has been a change in the services bringing elderly people, particularly in the west, to their hospital appointments in Dublin.  In the past, when things were bad and we had no money, there was respect and support for the elderly and we were able to bring them to hospital appointments.</P>
        <P>I got a letter today from the Health Service Executive, western region, about a woman who had a liver transplant two years ago and who has had a kidney transplant.  The HSE could not bring her to the hospital for her appointment because it did not the resources.  It stated it did not have enough money in the health budget to do that, which is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>This is a very serious issue.  I will have to bring a few of my constituents to the House to show the Minister of State the type of people who are not getting the service they deserve.  We will shortly march to the HSE offices in Castlebar to show it the type of people concerned.  If RTE and the media were doing their jobs, they would come to Mayo to see some of the people who have had to cancel their hospital appointments because the HSE has a new policy in regard to bringing people to their appointments in Dublin.</P>
        <P>People in north Mayo due to go into hospital for an operation on a Monday must wait until Sunday evening for a phone call from an executive in a hospital to know whether a bed is available.  Then they must make arrangements for transport, which they cannot get in the west.  The HSE could not bring this woman I mentioned who has had liver and kidney transplants to her appointment.  It wrote a three-page letter explaining why it could not do so.  It blamed the Minister of State and the Department and stated that there is no funding in place.  It said the ambulance service is not there to bring sick people, such as her, to their hospital appointments.</P>
        <P>Do we have any respect for the elderly, sick and the weak?  Are we going to continue to push the weak and the sick aside?  A Taoiseach on a general election campaign did not realise the health service was so bad.  However, the people are waiting for the opportunity to vote on this issue.</P>
        <P>I heard today about the amount of revenue collected.  Deputy Walsh, a former Minister, is in the House and even in the bad old days when we had nothing, we had respect for the sick and the elderly, but now we cannot even bring them to hospital appointments.  There is a row going on between the HSE and the Department that the funding is not in place for this service.  The weak and the sick are suffering and people must cancel their hospital appointments in Dublin and Galway.</P>
        <P>Somebody living in Blacksod in Belmullet lives 80 miles from Castlebar, 150 miles from Galway and over 200 miles from Dublin.  People on disability or social welfare only have &euro;165 per week <Col N="1346"/>on which to live, yet they are expected to provide transport to their hospital appointments in Dublin even though they are sick.  There are hundreds of such people in my constituency and I will shortly bring some of those who are fit to come out to a protest meeting in Castlebar.  I will show the people of this country what is happening and what we are doing to our elderly people.</P>

	<P>I would need approximately ten minutes because what is going on is a disgrace.  As a Deputy from Dublin, the Acting Chairman would not like to see his constituents wondering how they are going to get to their hospital appointments.  </P>
        <P>Something must be done and I ask the Minister of State to sit down with officials from the HSE in my region and draw up a policy on who can and cannot be brought to hospital appointments.  Let us not have a situation where this poor creature who has had liver and kidney transplants could not make her hospital appointment last week because the HSE would not bring her to it.  If that is not cruelty, what is it?  We have more respect for the rich flying in for the All-Ireland finals and the Ryder Cup and who will not pay their taxes in this country, but we will not look after our elderly.  It is a disgrace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to address this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The Department has been informed by the national ambulance office of the HSE that, while the statistical information required by the Deputy is not readily available, it will arrange for the collation of the information requested and furnish a reply directly to him.  Deputy Ring gave details in regard to a particular case.  I was not aware he was going to raise it but I will get further details from him and will take the matter up directly with the HSE on his behalf.</P>
        <P>The role and purpose of the ambulance service is to provide a clinically appropriate and timely pre-hospital care and transport service.  Pre-hospital emergency care and transportation services are provided as an integral part of the continuum of care for patients.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of the ambulance service is on the provision of emergency transport for those patients with an acute medical need.  However, the HSE also arranges for the provision of patient transport services and examines all requests for such services on a case by case basis, taking account of individual needs.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that its national ambulance office, in conjunction with primary community and continuing care in the national hospital office, is currently arranging for a comprehensive review to be undertaken of the non-<Col N="1347"/>emergency transport needs of patients attending HSE facilities.  This review will include an examination of the service currently delivered nationally and make recommendations that will inform its future development.  The HSE has advised that it anticipates that the view will be completed by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>Given what the Deputy said, I am concerned that transport was not available to a person in that situation.  I will follow the matter up and get back to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for immediate action on the development of the sexual assault treatment unit in Kerry General Hospital.  The unit in Kerry is in difficulty due to the lack of resources at the hospital.  A working group consisting of Kerry General Hospital, Tralee garda&iacute; and the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre has come up with proposals to solve this difficulty and has reached an agreement with the hospital.  The group needs to raise &euro;47,284 for on-call nursing staff.  If this funding can be raised, it will be in a position to offer a 24-hour sexual assault treatment unit in Kerry General Hospital.</P>
        <P>Currently, there is only one 24-hour sexual assault unit in the Munster area, which is in Cork.  A need was identified in Kerry for a sexual assault unit to ensure that victims of rape could be examined at Kerry General Hospital.  A pilot scheme was undertaken in April 2002, which operated very successfully and 60 clients were seen and supported.</P>
        <P>A decision was made in September 2004 to contact general practitioners in the Kerry region to provide trained doctors on an on-call rota to undertake the forensic medical examinations.  A total of ten GPs were interested in undertaking the training.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform committed funding to the cost incurred in forensic examinations.  Unfortunately, due to lack of resources to fund a nursing post and on-call nurses, this initiative could not take place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The genesis of a service is available but it is functioning at a very low level due entirely to a lack of nursing resources.  Even with the existence of a sexual assault unit in Kerry, victims in remote parts of the county will still have to travel for at least an hour.  Victims now reporting may have to travel to Cork &mdash; a six-hour round trip &mdash; for the examination.  This is an unacceptable burden on someone who has been subjected to the most traumatic experience of rape.  Victims are also required to return to Cork at their own expense for any follow-up treatment, which may involve up to four visits.</P>
        <P>Research shows that only one in ten people raped or sexually assaulted reports to the Garda.  However, expecting people to travel to another <Col N="1348"/>county for the examination will result in even fewer rape victims reporting the crime.  Research has also shown that when dedicated services are available an increase in reporting follows.  One rape victim who did not want to report to the Garda told a counsellor in the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre that she felt very isolated as there was nowhere for her to go for a medical examination if she did not report.  Another victim said she felt very uncomfortable having to go to Cork with garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>It is the experience of counsellors in the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre that the majority of rape victims who had to travel to Cork for the forensic medical examination did not avail of counselling until months later.  It is accepted that most people dealing with the aftermath of a rape want to feel safe, be somewhere familiar and have access to support.  It is evident that having to travel to Cork does not meet these requirements.  According to the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre, the majority of rape victims examined in Kerry avail of counselling immediately after the incident, in stark contrast with rape victims who have to travel to Cork.</P>
        <P>The development of the sexual assault unit at Kerry General Hospital ought to achieve an increase in current levels of reporting and an increased sense of safety for those who make the decision to report.  There is a framework in place in Kerry for the delivery of a structured response that encompasses all aspects of care for rape victims.  Commitment and co-operation is evident between all the agencies and access to training is provided for all personnel involved.  The very experienced consultant gynaecologist there is highly skilled and experienced in forensic medical examinations for victims of rape.  The Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre provides an on-call facility.  These volunteers are highly trained and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</P>
        <P>The local Garda has been proactive for many years in developing a professional, sensitive service for rape victims, in keeping with best practice and agreed protocols.  Trained female garda&iacute; are available at all times to attend the forensic examination.  The hospital has a dedicated space available for the examinations.  This space is similar to examination suites used in the UK.</P>
        <P>There is a strong commitment from all the agencies involved to have this valuable service available in Kerry.  The arguments for the provision of such a service are supported by national and international research.  Being supported, informed and kept informed is of critical importance to rape victims and can enhance the healing process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Acting Chairman for his patience, as I have exceeded my time.  Next weekend, the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre will be co-ordinating the collection of signatures supporting its cause in Tralee, Killarney, Listowel and Dingle.  The amount of funding requested is min<Col N="1349"/>uscule at &euro;47,284.  This situation should never have been allowed to arise, given that the amount of money involved is relatively small in the context of the overall health budget.  I am asking for this matter to be resolved immediately.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, can make an announcement before Saturday, if possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this important matter on the Adjournment.  In general there is little appreciation of the devastation suffered by victims of sexual assault.</P>
        <P>The national steering committee on violence against women was established following the report of the task force on violence against women in 1997.  It is chaired by Deputy Fahey, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The purpose of the national steering committee is to provide a multidisciplinary, multi-agency and cohesive response to the problem of violence against women and in so doing to progress the recommendations of the task force.  The steering committee is representative of a wide range of interests concerned with violence against women.  The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive are represented on this committee.</P>
        <P>The objectives of the committee include ensuring that regional and local structures are established, developing public awareness campaigns, co-ordinating and advising on the distribution of resources nationally, and co-ordinating and advising on ongoing development of policies including those concerning perpetrators, criminal justice intervention, services and supports.</P>
        <P>In June of this year the national steering committee working group published its report entitled, Sexual Assault Treatment Services &mdash; A National Review.  The report detailed the current level of service provision and also made a number of recommendations for the future provision of services.</P>
        <P>The factors that determine the location of sexual assault treatment units include sustainability of services, travel time and previous reporting rates.  The sexual assault treatment unit, SATU, for the southern hospitals group catchment area of Cork and Kerry is located in the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, SFVUH, Cork.  It is staffed by a nurse manager and a team of nurses providing an out-of-hours, on-call service, while a team of GPs provide medical cover.</P>
        <P>The review group recommended that two additional SATUs be established, one in Galway city and the other in the midland region and it is committed to continual review of these services.  Both the Minister and I are keen to see the recommendations from this report treated as a <Col N="1350"/>priority within the HSE and I anticipate that the HSE funding priorities for 2007 will reflect this.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to working with all interested parties and service providers and has undertaken a range of measures to reduce the incidence of domestic violence, to respond to the needs of both victims and perpetrators and to raise awareness among the public about the dynamics of these crimes.  These measures can be seen across a wide range of Government policies and initiatives and include legislative measures, Garda response, health services, the national steering committee on violence against women, national research and treatment programmes for perpetrators.</P>
        <P>A key indicator of Government commitment to the issue can be seen in the involvement of many Departments and agencies in the funding and provision of services.  These include the Health Service Executive and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>Funding in the health sector has risen from approximately &euro;3.8 million in 1997 to approximately &euro;12 million in 2005.  The allocation of funding for front-line services is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  Many services are provided by non-governmental organisations on behalf of the executive.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to acknowledge the valuable work undertaken by the non-governmental organisations, such as women&rsquo;s refuges, rape crisis centres and Women&rsquo;s Aid to mention just some in this area.  I also wish to acknowledge the direct supports provided by the HSE through its sexual assault treatment units, counselling services, accident and emergency units, social work services, GP and hospital and community services.</P>

      <sTitle>Special Educational Needs.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention behind raising this matter is to ensure adequate funding is provided for autism-specific educational training centres in Mayo.  At present if one looks at a map of the geographical spread of such centres it is clear that they are all located on the east coast and there is none in the west.  It is obvious that children also suffer from autism in the west of Ireland and that autism-specific education or applied behavioural analysis, ABA, offers the best hope for an improvement in the condition to autistic children and their families.  It is a terrible scandal that this essential service is not available in the west, specifically in Mayo.</P>
        <P>I recently attended a special meeting organised by the Mayo Autism Support Group.  People&rsquo;s eyes were opened to the need for and value of autism-specific education.  The speakers at the meeting included Dr. Mark de Salvo, the parent of an autistic child.  He was inspiring.  He outlined how he set up the Saplings school in Celbridge, County Kildare which offers autism-specific edu<Col N="1351"/>cation using the ABA system.  Dr. de Salvo stated that there is already a waiting list for hundreds of children for that school.  The school has a success rate of up to 50% which is a remarkable achievement as autism is a challenging condition that affects the entire family of those who suffer from it.</P>
        <P>I am full of admiration for the cogent effort made by the families and carers of autistic children and adults.  It is a national scandal that the parents of autistic children have needed to fight tooth and nail for proper education for their loved ones.  Recently, I received a reply from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.  Millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money are being spent by the State to fight parents looking for these services.  In other words, it is trying to defend the indefensible. That does not make sense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Parents set up systems, but unfortunately those systems did not work because the teachers appointed with the help of the Department proved to be untrained in autistic teaching.  They had primary degrees and were unsuitable for the job.  The children, therefore, did not do well.  I am less than impressed by the Department and how it behaved in respect of defending the indefensible and wasting millions in legal fees fighting parents who are looking for these essential services.</P>
        <P>The 2001 report of the task force on autism states that the needs of persons with an ASD must be met as a matter of constitutional priority and that the costs associated with meeting the needs of persons with autistic spectrum disorders must be faced by society and by the administrators of the education system.  It is a constitutional right of children to receive autism-specific training.  Children who are past primary education have the greatest problems as the largest gap in the system is in that area.  In 2001, the task force identified that gap, stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is noteworthy that while all pupils with disabilities within the primary school system now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs as per Circular 8/99, this automatic entitlement has not yet been extended to pupils at the post-primary stage.  In practice, however, provision is made for all identified post-primary pupils with disabilities at the request of the school.  However, evidence from submissions indicate that considerable delays in procuring this provision are, in many instances, the norm.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This situation has not changed since 2001 and schools still have difficulties in sourcing staff trained to the appropriate level.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that a school with applied behavioural analysis and autism-specific trained teachers will be set up in County Mayo.  Those children matter, but they are currently left with inadequate teaching.  A <Col N="1352"/>success rate of 50% in the school in Kildare, with the opportunity of entering mainstream education, is remarkable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Science in respect of the educational provision for pupils with autistic spectrum disorders.  The Department has not received any application to expand the pilot scheme to a centre in County Mayo, but as he is aware, the Department is committed to ensuring that all children, including those with ASDs, receive an education appropriate to their needs.  In this regard, the Department has established 170 special classes for children with autism attached to special and mainstream schools, six of which are in the Mayo area, five special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome, 16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children in the autistic spectrum and 12 stand-alone facilities providing an applied behavioural analysis-specific methodology on a pilot basis.  Approval has been given for the establishment of a further two such facilities.  Saplings Centre in County Kildare is funded under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Department is of the opinion that children with autism, in common with all children, should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where they can mix with their wider peer groups and have maximum opportunities for integration.  Pupils with autism who are fully integrated into mainstream schools receive individual teaching support for a number of hours per week as well as support from special needs assistants and special equipment, if required.  Pupils attending these classes benefit from having a wider range of autistic spectrum disorder teaching methodologies open to them, fully qualified national school teachers, a school structure and the option of integration into mainstream classes immediately available depending on each child&rsquo;s ability and progress.</P>
        <P>Schools have the support of the special education support service, which is committed to providing continual training as appropriate.  Staffing supports for autistic children in special classes in ordinary and special schools have a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of six pupils to every teacher.  A minimum of two special needs assistants are provided per class with the possibility of additional special needs assistant posts being made available up to a 1:1 basis where required.</P>
        <P>The newly established National Council for Special Education and its team of more than 70 special educational needs organisers is working throughout the country to ensure that the new services are put in place where needed so that children with special needs, including those in the autistic spectrum, have access to appropriate <Col N="1353"/>school-based provision.  I assure the Deputy that the Department will examine any proposal submitted to expand the pilot scheme to a centre in County Mayo and I thank him for raising this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter to be discussed.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who has made himself available to take this debate.</P>
        <P>I am raising this matter out of deep frustration with the fact that while 15 hectares of suitable land was made available to Cork County Council for an affordable housing scheme two and a half years ago, little or no progress has since been made.  In the meantime, young people, many of whom are on reasonable salaries, cannot afford to acquire houses of their own.  In the west Cork region, sites typically cost between &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000 and houses cost between &euro;450,000 and &euro;750,000.  In a recent survey, Clonakilty was deemed to be the most expensive part of the country, including Dublin city and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>These young people who want their own homes call to me as their representative and ask me what the Government is doing about the lack of progress, to which I reply that the local authority has a difficulty.  In the worst example of rural snobbery I have encountered in 30 years in public life, Fine Gael tried to stymie this development.  In June, however, a clear majority of Cork County Council voted in favour of the project notwithstanding a minority of Fine Gael councillors who voted against it out of pure snobbery.</P>
        <P>These young people are fine citizens.  They work locally and want nothing more than their own homes.  The council received the land as a gift from Teagasc, but it is frustrating and reprehensible that, on the face of it, nothing has been done.  I have been told by council officials that this matter must go through a section 8 process.  The scenic route taken is baffling.  After June, there should have been no significant problem.  I was told that the matter needed to be advertised in various journals, but I have yet to see any advertisement.  We are approaching the middle of October and Christmas advertisements are already in the newspapers.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Fair play to the Minister of State, who went to the trouble of visiting the site on foot of my report that nothing was happening locally.  I ask that he instruct the housing authority to take this matter seriously and give it priority.  It will be a lovely eco-village of 100 houses with playing pitches and all sorts of amenities.  It is a crying shame that it is not currently going ahead.  I would appreciate positive news from the Minister of State, who was kind enough to appear in the House in response to my raising this matter.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Walsh for his continuing interest in this project.</P>
        <P>The site in Clonakilty was one of the sites released to the affordable housing initiative by Deputy Walsh and I acknowledge both this and the other sites released by him to the initiative during his tenure as Minister for Agriculture and Food.  While progress on this site may appear to be slow, Cork County Council, whose responsibility it is to plan and develop this project, states it is advancing this project as speedily as possible.  Officials in my Department are in constant contact with the council to monitor progress and to ensure that any obstacles to progress are dealt with.  I am aware that senior officials of the Department and the county council have met in Cork recently to discuss this and other affordable housing projects throughout County Cork.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will not go through the detail of the various steps that have taken place to date, although it is important to mention that a feasibility assessment of the site was deemed necessary in the first instance.  Following this and the ensuing public consultation on the outcome of the feasibility study, a proposal to amend the local area plan was advertised and at its meeting on 22 May 2006, the council voted after many objections to approve the amended plan.</P>
        <P>While the council considered a number of different options in developing the site, in terms of developing it in one phase or a number of phases, I held the view that the site should be developed in one phase and I am happy that the council is proceeding along these lines.  The site will comprise a mix of affordable, social, voluntary and private homes, with 74 of the 104 homes being made available under the affordable housing scheme.</P>
        <P>The next stage in the process is to apply for Part 8 planning and the council advertised for expressions of interest from consultants on 22 September 2006, for the preparation of the relevant documentation required for the Part 8 process, and for the preparation of cost plans, tender documentation and construction contract.</P>
        <P>Due to the size of the project, the advertisement was also placed in the <i>EU Journal</i>.  The closing date for expressions of interest is 31 October 2006 at which stage the council will short-list a number of bidders and proceed with the selection process to select the successful bidder.  The next stage will be to apply for Part 8 and the outcome of the planning process will determine when construction can commence on the site.  The ultimate aim, as with all projects under the affordable housing initiative, is to give people affordable homes as quickly as possible and I look forward to the day when all 104 homes are occupied and a new vibrant and successful community is in place.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Walsh for the site and for pressing this matter, locally and nationally.  I <Col N="1355"/>think I have been successful in increasing the output of affordable homes.  However, I need the co-operation of local authority officials and elected members in this regard.  The help from the elected members on Cork County Council has been reluctantly dragged out of them, and this applies to Fine Gael members in particular.  As I see it, Fine Gael does not want these houses to be ready, or even started, by the date of the next election.  They probably will be successful because their delaying tactics and snobbish attitude to this idea from the very beginning will probably see that the work will not start by the date of the election.  I am trying and I am pressing the officials in the Department to do all they can, but we have lost many months through these delaying <Col N="1356"/>tactics.  While I will keep up the pressure, it is quite likely at this stage that the delaying tactics by Fine Gael members on the council have been successful.</P>
        <P>I note that Deputy Walsh, like me, would very much like to see the bulldozer even going on site the day before the election, but time is quickly running out and the filibustering and delaying tactics by the county council, and by the elected members in particular, has been successful.  I promise Deputy Walsh that I will continue to press the matter, through the officials, with the county council as best I can.</P>

	<P>The planning process for the proposed prison development at Spike Island has not yet commenced.  I am advised by the Prison Service that it expects to be in a position to lodge the relevant planning documents in early 2007.  Full details of the proposed prison development will be made known at that time in accordance with the statutory planning procedure.  At that stage, all of the relevant material including properly balanced assessments of the various issues involved will be made available.</P>
        <P>A separate but related planning issue relates to access to the island.  I have instructed the Office of Public Works (OPW) to prepare the relevant planning procedures including an assessment of the environmental and related issues arising to enable the construction of a bridge to the island.  I am advised by the OPW that this planning process will commence shortly.</P>

	<P>I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that in the first three weeks of the Weapons Amnesty, which commenced on the 1st September, 2006, 101 guns, 26 knives and 14 assorted offensive weapons were handed in to Garda stations throughout the country.  In addition, a quantity of ammunition has also been surrendered.  The amnesty runs for a period of 2 months, from 1st September to 31st October, 2006, and I am confident that many more weapons will be surrendered to the Garda&iacute; before the amnesty ends. </P>
        <P>My Department has engaged in an extensive advertising campaign to promote the amnesty.  This includes the production of 20,000 information leaflets for distribution through Garda stations throughout the country, a media advertising campaign in the national and provincial newspapers together with an extensive billboard advertising campaign.  The media advertising campaign will run for the duration of the amnesty and this campaign will be augmented in the latter stage with a nationwide billboard advertising campaign, involving over 200 sites throughout the country, which will run from the 9th October to the 22nd October.</P>

	<P>The National Women&rsquo;s Strategy, which is nearing completion, is a wide ranging document setting out the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to foster socio-economic opportunity;  well-being; and active participation in decision making for the women of Ireland over a ten year period.  </P>
        <P>The Strategy is set in a context where we have a strong corpus of equality legislation in place but where women still experience difficulties in achieving true gender equality.  The Deputy&rsquo;s earlier question on the gender pay gap, to which he refers in this question, is just one of a range of issues where women still experience inequality.  The issues are often complex and multifaceted and the answers are therefore also complex and require far-seeing responses.</P>
        <P>The Inter-Departmental Committee appointed to undertake the task of preparing the Strategy brings together senior representatives from all fifteen Government Departments under the chairmanship of my Department.  This Committee has been tasked to</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />take responsibility for drafting and finalising a National Women&rsquo;s Strategy, as committed to in Sustaining Progress;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />consult with the Social Partners and National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, through the Consultation Group, in developing the Strategy; and</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />advise in relation to a communication plan for the publication and launch of the Strategy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Consultation Group includes representatives of the employer organisations, trade unions, the community and voluntary pillar, the farming pillar and the National Women&rsquo;s Council.  This group is tasked to</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />receive and comment on drafts of the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy as prepared by the Inter-Departmental Committee;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />advise in relation to the content of the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy; and</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />contribute to the development of a communication plan for the publication and launch of the Strategy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, the Equality Authority has been consulted in relation to the Strategy.</P>
        <P>The Inter-Departmental Committee is currently finalising a full draft of the Strategy prior <Col N="1360"/>to its submission for further consideration by the Consultation Group.  I am hopeful that the Strategy will be ready for publication before the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The draft Strategy is a well structured document which aims to draw together all of the actions of Government which impact upon the lives of women.  It is therefore very broad ranging, addressing issues varying from social inclusion and women&rsquo;s risk of poverty to female membership of State Boards, from the gender pay gap to female entrepreneurship.</P>
        <P>Its aim is to include a range of actions which support women in all the facets of their lives, from school through to old age and its implementation will involve positive actions from almost all Government Departments.</P>
        <P>The National Women&rsquo;s Strategy is being prepared to honour a commitment made to the women of Ireland, both in Sustaining Progress, the partnership agreement, and in the international forum of CEDAW, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.</P>
        <P>The present Strategy was preceded by an Action Plan prepared in the context of the Beijing Platform for Action under the auspices of the United Nations.  Again the Beijing Platform for Action, which was prepared in the context of a UN World Summit for Women, identified twelve areas of concern in relation to women&rsquo;s issues.  Cognisance is being taken of these in the preparation of the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy.</P>
        <P>In addition, in preparation for the Action Plan, a widespread consultation took place with women throughout Ireland and their aspirations are being incorporated as far as possible into the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy.</P>
        <P>While it may appear that the preparation of the Strategy has been time consuming, it has involved a significant amount of research and consultation with a view to preparing a comprehensive strategy that will resonate with all the women of Ireland.  I make no apology for the time which it is taking, as I believe that the Strategy, when published, will provide a solid road map for the achievement of true gender equality in Ireland.</P>

        <Quest> when he will implement section 16 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 which provides that a video recording of evidence given by a person under 17 years of age in respect of sexual or violent offences shall be admissible as trial evidence; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30623/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 16 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, as amended, makes provision for the video recording of any evidence <Col N="1361"/>given, in relation to a sexual offence or an act involving violence, by a person under 17 years of age through a live television link in proceedings relating to indictable offences.  The relevant subsection &mdash; (1)(a) &mdash; was commenced in 1993.  It will be noted that this subsection covers persons under 14 years of age also.</P>
        <P>Section 16 also makes provision &mdash; in subsection (1)(b) &mdash; for the video recording of a statement made by a person under 14 years of age (in respect of whom a sexual offence or an offence involving violence is alleged to have been committed) during an interview with a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other person who is competent for the purpose.  It provides that such a video recording shall be admissible at a trial as evidence, provided that the person whose statement was video recorded is available at the trial for cross examination.</P>
        <P>My predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform established a committee in 1998 to draw up guidelines for persons involved in video recording interviews with a complainant (aged under 14 years of age or with an intellectual disability) in relation to a sexual and/or violent offence during an interview with a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other person competent for the purpose, as he considered that it would benefit complainants and interviewers if good practice guidelines on the conduct and recording of such interviews were made available.  This committee subsequently submitted in 2003 advisory Good Practice Guidelines with related recommendations.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines cover a number of areas.  In addition, the committee made a number of recommendations, including recommendations that:</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />there should be sufficient suitable facilities available for video recording evidential interviews;</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />there should be a joint national programme in place for training interviewers, which should be regularly reviewed.  In tandem with this, there will be a need for a national training programme for all professionals who are likely to have reference to the Guidelines.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Devising new mechanisms to oversee the implementation of the Good Practice Guidelines and associated recommendations by the Garda&iacute; and the health authorities requires input from a number of Departments and agencies, including the Health Service Executive, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department and the Department of Health and Children.  This view is shared by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>My Department obtained the views of the Health Service Executive on the most effective mechanisms to oversee the implementation of the Guidelines and associated recommendations, including the issues of how a joint national train<Col N="1362"/>ing programme might be developed by the agencies involved and how suitable places to conduct interviews of the type in question might be made available.  My Department also obtained the views of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The advice received is that Garda stations or Health Centres or other such facilities would be inappropriate places in which to conduct such interviews.  However, the Probation Service has identified suitable accommodation in one of its premises in Dublin.  The Office of Public Works has been informed, and an architect and electrical engineer have been appointed to work on the project.</P>
        <P>Work is proceeding on drawing up a specification for the facility.  As part of this work, arrangements are being made by the Health Service Executive to view a care suite in Northern Ireland, receive an overview on training and other relevant service issues.  In addition, the HSE is arranging for the viewing of a similar facility in this jurisdiction which is used for therapeutic purposes.  The HSE is also in contact with the Irish network of professionals working in child sexual abuse assessments.</P>
        <P>I attach the highest importance to the setting up of this facility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Operation Anvil commenced in the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Region on 17 May, 2005.  It is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting this criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The Operation remains in place and is on-going in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  It was extended nationwide in 2006.</P>
        <P>Outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region, a series of special operations, prepared by senior Garda managers and designed to focus on areas and incidents of high crime, has been initiated.  These operations are focused with particular targets identified.  A number of these operations have been completed, while further are ongoing.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in recorded crime in the target crime areas under the operation.  An example of a recent success is the operation carried out in the Moyross area last week, in which four arrests were made and four firearms (two rifles and two sawn off shotguns) and a quantity of ammunition were seized.</P>
        <P>A budget of approximately &euro;11 million has been allocated for Operation Anvil during 2006, and the Garda Commissioner has been advised that an additional &euro;10 million has been made available for further operations to tackle gang related crime.</P>
        <P>The most recent figures available to me show that since the introduction of Operation Anvil in May 2005, 515 firearms have been seized in the Dublin Metropolitan Region. To date, Operation Anvil has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests for serious crimes, including 53 arrests in connection with murders in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  Outside the DMR over 1,683 persons have been arrested and 135 firearms seized.  I am advised that information on the number of charges preferred under Operation Anvil is not readily available.</P>
        <P>In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the <Col N="1364"/>problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Operation Anvil will continue to be funded to this extent as long as the Commissioner considers that it is necessary to do so and it is fulfilling its objectives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 194 together.</P>
        <P>Amendments to the Children Act 2001, introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, will effectively raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 7 years to 12 years, in all but the most serious cases.  In addition, proceedings against children under 14 years of age will require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  These provisions will come into force on the 16th of October this year.  Further provisions will allow the Court to dismiss a case against a child under 14 where it determines that the child did not have a full understanding of what was involved in the commission of the offence.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question, what I actually said was that public opinion in Ireland demanded that criminal prosecutions should be pursued against young people accused of homicide or sexual offences.  In the preparation of the recent legislation on the matter, careful consideration was given to getting the balance right  taking into account the vulnerability of young people and the consequential obligation on Government, supported by public opinion, to respond differently to their needs and deeds.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that there have been cases in other jurisdictions where there have been murders by 11 year olds.  There have been serious offences committed here by 11 year olds.  Thankfully the number of cases is very small.  However, I do not think it is satisfactory for victims that the <Col N="1365"/>only sanction is for the perpetrators to be referred to social services.  In addressing serious youth offending there is an obligation on Government to provide strong law together with good programmes if they are found guilty.</P>
        <P>The exceptions to the general age of responsibility of 12 years have been introduced for a number of good reasons.  I do not believe that the original proposal in the 2001 Act, which would have given 10 and 11 year old children total immunity to being dealt with for the most serious offences on the statute book would be an acceptable situation.  As well as that, the common law meaning of the age of criminal responsibility is the age of capacity to commit an offence, the offence <i>per se</i> is not available as a ground for intervention in relation to the child.</P>
        <P>The changes to the age of criminal responsibility have removed the concept where a child under a particular age does not have the capacity to commit an offence.  I think we can all accept that the age and level of maturity of a child may, in some cases, have an effect on his or her full understanding of what is involved in the commission of an offence.  The amendments to the Children Act give the Court the power to consider this question on an individual basis for a child under the age of fourteen.  Different children mature at different rates.  The 2001 Act adopts an individualised approach which allows the Court to exercise discretion in determining in any particular case the child&rsquo;s understanding of what is involved in the commission of an offence.</P>
        <P>In practical terms what all this means is that no child under 12 years of age can be charged with an offence apart from unlawful killing; a rape offence or aggravated sexual assault; no proceedings can be taken against a child under 14 years except by or with the consent of the DPP; and any case against such a child can be dismissed where the court determines that the child did not have a full understanding of what was involved in the commission of the offence.</P>
        <P>If current trends continue it will be very rare that a child under 12 years of age will be charged with an offence and the reality is that not all children under 14 years of age will be charged or prosecuted.</P>
        <P>By any standard what I have proposed is reasonable and positive.  Section 4.1 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice does not define a minimum age of criminal responsibility.  It requires that the age &ldquo;shall not be fixed at too low a level&rdquo; and that  the &ldquo;emotional, mental and intellectual maturity&rdquo; of the child should be borne in mind.</P>
        <P>I remind the Deputy that I am raising the age of criminal responsibility from 7, as it is at present, to 12 in almost all cases, effective from the 16th of October, 2006.  I have also introduced specific provisions in respect of the age and <Col N="1366"/>maturity of the child, in accordance with the Beijing Rules.</P>
        <P>The age of criminal responsibility is just one aspect of a much wider youth justice policy, the legislative framework for which is set out in the Children Act 2001.  A substantial portion of this Act is already in force, I am happy to say replacing the somewhat dated 1908 Children Act.  It is my intention, and that of my colleague the Minister for Children, to see the outstanding provisions of the 2001 Act implemented in early 2007.  There have also been a number of other significant developments in the areas of youth justice recently.  One of which was the establishment of the new Irish Youth Justice Service as an executive office of my Department last December.  These along with other developments are already creating improvements in our youth justice system and delivering better outcomes for children who come into contact with the law.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In my reply to Priority Question No. 4 of 27 April 2006, I provided a comprehensive update on the significant progress being made in relation to civilianisation, and again in reply to Oral Question No. 19 of 8 June 2006.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that over the Summer further significant progress has been made.  The main developments in this regard are as follows:  the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) in Castlebar is now almost fully operational, with some 150 civilian staff now employed there out of a sanctioned total of 160.  Recruitment of the remaining staff is currently underway.  The GISC allows Garda&iacute; who would otherwise have to return to their Stations to input data on the PULSE system, to log the information with the GISC, while remaining on the beat.  This major initiative has freed up significant amounts of Garda time for continued operational duty.  The Garda authorities are already considering what other tasks could be devolved to the GISC which would release additional Garda resources to front-line policing.</P>
        <P>Discussions have now concluded with staff interests regarding the transfer of civilian staff to the direct control of the Garda Commissioner, a reform provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  I will shortly make the required Order to give effect to the transfer of staff on 16 October next.</P><Col N="1367"/>
        <P>As part of the agreement with the staff side on the transfer of staff, sanction has been granted by the Minister for Finance for an additional 76 civilian clerical and administrative posts to be located around the country on a regional and divisional basis.  Recruitment to these posts will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The Human Resources Division for civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has now been established and when fully operational will have a staffing complement of 37 civilians who will carry out recruitment, training, discipline, industrial relations and general HR administrative functions for the 1,900 clerical, administrative, professional, technical and industrial civilians now working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Division will also play a key strategic role in driving forward the wider Civilianisation Programme.  The Director and a number of staff have now commenced duty, and recruitment of the remaining staff is underway.</P>
        <P>A new civilian Accommodation Manager at Garda Headquarters commenced duty on 11 September last.</P>
        <P>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, the Commissioner became the Accounting Officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July this year.  This transfer of responsibility is being supported by the recruitment of nine (9) civilian Finance &amp; Procurement staff.</P>
        <P>I have also received sanction from my colleague the Minister for Finance to civilianise 31 posts in the Garda Telecommunications area.  These positions, most of which were previously occupied by Garda&iacute;, will be advertised shortly.</P>
        <P>Progress is also being made on recruitment to a range of new civilian posts, including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />28 staff (statisticians, analysts and administrative staff) for the Professional Standards Unit;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />10 internal audit posts;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />14 additional teaching/training posts in the Garda College, Templemore; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />29 crime analysts.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Meanwhile, the Joint Implementation Group (JIG) comprising management representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department is continuing its work on civilianisation.  Given that the 2001 Civilianisation Report was written at a particular point in time, the JIG is taking account of changes which have occurred in the environment in which civilianisation is being pursued and looking at ways in which the Civilianisation Programme can be advanced in the shorter term, both in the context of the report and otherwise.  As the Deputy can see, considerable progress is now being made by the Group and further initiatives are being planned.</P>
        <P>I might add that significant progress is being made in the current recruitment drive to increase <Col N="1368"/>the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government.  This project is fully on target and will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.</P>
        <P>I am determined to drive the Civilianisation Programme forward to ensure that the Garda&iacute; being recruited in this current historic expansion of the Force are deployed to front-line policing duties and that appropriately trained and qualified civilians make the greatest contribution possible consistent with the effective and efficient functioning of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am confident that the progress now being made on civilianisation will deliver on both fronts.</P>

	<P>I published the Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Dean Lyons case on 1 September 2006.  I believe the Report, based on the evidence of all relevant witnesses, offers a thorough independent analysis of the facts surrounding the false confession made by Dean Lyons.  I am pleased to note that the provisions of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 which I availed of in this case have ensured a timely and cost effective investigation without in any way compromising or encroaching on its proper conduct.  I am indebted to Mr. Birmingham and his legal and administrative personnel for the thorough manner in which they performed this difficult and sensitive task.</P>
        <P>I sent a copy of the report to the Garda Commissioner and at present it is under consideration by him.</P>
        <P>I also sent a copy to the Expert Group which I established in the light of concerns arising from the Dean Lyons case.  The Group will be reporting to me on the adequacy of Garda training, protocols, regulations and procedures, in assessing the fitness of suspects to be interviewed and on the recording of any bona fide reser<Col N="1369"/>vations of an individual member of a Garda investigation team as to the truthfulness or accuracy of self-incriminating statements.  The Expert Group comprises ex Asst Commissioner Tony Hickey, Mr Charles Smith ex Director of the Central Mental Hospital, a senior official from the DPP&rsquo;s office and a senior civil servant.</P>

	<P>The question of Ireland signing and ratifying the Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings is currently being examined.</P>
        <P>Legislation creating a criminal offence of trafficking in persons for the specific purpose of sexual or labour exploitation is contained in the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill 2006 which is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  This Bill will allow for compliance with the criminal law requirements of the Convention.  However, the Bill will be more comprehensive than dealing only with trafficking issues; it will also provide greater protection to vulnerable persons, in particular children, against sexual abuse and generally keep our legislation in that respect up to date.</P>
        <P>As regards the treatment of victims, the current immigration procedure in Ireland allows victims to be dealt with sympathetically. Compliance with the Convention will require a more formalised process for dealing with trafficking victims.  However, in practice it would not result in any major change in the way cases are dealt with at present.</P>

I understand that the initial work of the Commission has involved study visits to their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK and initial meetings with the various stakeholders involved in the Garda complaints system, such as Garda management, the Garda representative bodies and officials of my Department.  This process is aimed at enabling the Commission to establish principles regarding its approach to investigating complaints and to work on the development of operational protocols with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Commission have advertised all of their senior posts: Director of Investigations, Deputy Director of Investigations, Director of Administration and Head of Legal Affairs, and all of their investigative staff.  General staff will be sourced from Department of Finance Dublin decentralisation arrangements.  The short list for the post of Director of Investigations have been interviewed and I understand that an offer to the successful candidate is imminent.  Interviews for the remaining senior posts are scheduled by the Public Appointments Service to take place later this month.  The Commission is working towards being in a position to receive complaints as soon as possible in 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148, 199, 201 and 208 together.</P>
        <P>As indicated in the Government Legislative Programme, announced by the Chief Whip on 26 September 2006, the Privacy Bill is included amongst those Bills whose Second Stage debate is awaited.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Bill was published on 4 July 2006.  The main purpose of the Bill is to introduce a modern statutory framework to protect all citizens from the invasion of their privacy.  The Bill does not introduce a new cause of action, but rather recognises the probability that there is a pre-existing cause of action in respect of privacy interests afforded by the Constitution and makes clear the scope of that cause of action.  In addition, the Bill takes into account the privacy guarantees stipulated in the European Convention on Human Rights, and the extensive development of those guarantees effected by decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Bill does not pose a threat to newsgathering activities.  The Bill, in section 5, provides for the defence in a privacy action of fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public importance.  This is a significant safeguard to the continued operation of bona fide newsgathering operations.  The Bill will support the publication of material that is in the public interest.  It will clarify the law for publishers and remove the grey areas that exist for them at present.</P>
        <P>I have met the representatives of the print media &mdash; the Press Industry Steering Committee &mdash; on a number of occasions in recent years, primarily in the context of the reform of the law on defamation.  At their request, I expect to meet again with the Committee in the near future to discuss any concerns they may have on the Privacy Bill.</P>

All of the Garda representative bodies were invited to engage in constructive discussion of those draft regulations.  The regulations were approved by Government in July and recruitment for the Reserve commenced in August.  </P>
        <P>Both the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Association, while advising their members to comply with any orders regarding implementation of the Reserve, have declared their continued opposition to the Reserve.  This is a clear contravention of the terms of the new social partnership agreement <i>Towards 2016</i>, which requires &ldquo;co-operation with the implementation of policies, initiatives and reforms following Government decisions or the enactment of legislation (primary, secondary or EU).&rdquo;  A continued unwillingness on the part of the two associations to accept this fundamental principle of Towards 2016 will prevent the application of that agreement, including its provisions on pay increases, to their members.</P>
        <P>I should say that, notwithstanding the position of both associations, members of all ranks have co-operated with the recruitment, interviewing, security vetting, equipping and training of applicants for the Reserve, and the first group of 37 Reserve Trainees was welcomed to the Garda College in Templemore last Saturday to commence training.</P>
        <P>Finally recent remarks attributed to the General Secretary of the GRA to the effect that members of the Garda Reserve would be &ldquo;hated and despised&rdquo; represents, on the face of it, a deplorable attitude for a Garda towards his fellow citizens, the Oireachtas and the democratically expressed will of the people as contained in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</P>
        <P>I have therefore asked the Garda Commissioner to investigate this reported remark and to furnish an early report to me on the matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 213 together.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 3 April 2002 and made an application for asylum on the same day.  He withdrew his request for asylum on 21 October 2002 and made an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish child born on 8 October 2002.</P>
        <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &amp; O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003.  The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date.</P>
        <P>Since the person in question did not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain was considered in the context of a Ministerial proposal to deport him.  Before that process was finalised a new residency alternative was introduced for parents of Irish born children.  The person in question made an application for permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements announced by me on 15 January 2005 for parents of Irish children born before 1 January 2005, which is commonly referred to as the IBC/05 scheme.</P>
        <P>It is a requirement of the IBC/05 scheme that each applicant is resident in the State with their Irish child on a continuous basis since the child&rsquo;s birth and that evidence of such residence be provided with the application.  The person in question did not provide satisfactory evidence of being continuously resident in the State with his Irish born children since their birth.  Consequently his application under the revised arrangements was refused on 16 November 2005 on that basis.</P>
        <P>The immigration status of the person concerned is currently being reviewed.  In the event that the person in question does not have permission to remain following this review, he will then have an opportunity to make further representations as to his continued presence in the State.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Reserve Members) Regulations 2006 were approved by Government in July 2006.  Following this, a nationwide advertising and recruitment campaign for both Garda Reserve trainees and full-time Garda trainees was launched on 14 August 2006.  The recruitment campaign for full-time trainees closed on 19 September 2006.  Recruitment for the Garda Reserve will continue indefinitely.</P>
        <P>Recruitment for the Garda Reserve is being carried out by the Public Appointments Service.  Applications are being accepted by both internet and phone.  The total number of formal applications for the Garda Reserve at 19 September was 6,661.  This demonstrates the significant level of public interest in the Garda Reserve and the willingness of people to serve their local communities.</P>
        <P>It is planned to recruit 900 Reserve members in the current recruitment campaign.  Interviews for the first tranche of Reserve trainees were held in the week beginning 11 September.  Candidates for Reserve trainee have to undergo medical examinations and are subject to the same vetting process as full-time applicants.  Reserve trainees must be aged under 60 when commencing training.</P>
        <P>The first group of 37 trainees commenced training in the Garda College in Templemore last Saturday, 30 September.</P>
        <P>The comprehensive training programme for Garda Reserve trainees consists of more than 120 hours initial training, which is in accordance with best international standards.  The programme consists of five phases as follows:</P>
        <P>Phase One is a two day induction course to give Reserve members an appreciation of the Garda Organisation and its culture.</P>
        <P>Phase Two will consist of 56 hours training at evenings / weekends during which the trainee Reserve members will learn basic law and Garda procedures.</P>
        <P>Phase Three will be two days during which the trainee Reserve members will engage in role play exercises including radio procedures and be instructed in self defence, handcuff techniques and use of equipment.</P>
        <P>Phase Four will be a minimum of 40 hours at a nominated Garda Station during which the Trainee Reserve members will engage in accompanied beat patrol with a full-time Garda and Station duty under a Station Sergeant.</P>
        <P>Phase Five will be a one day graduation at the Garda College.</P>
        <P>The initial group of trainees will be assigned to the following five Garda stations: Sligo, Mill <Col N="1376"/>Street in Galway, Anglesea Street in Cork, Pearse Street, Dublin 2 and Store Street, Dublin 1.</P>
        <P>Preparations are being made for the introduction of the Reserve into other areas of the country in the coming months. Applicants will be contacted in the near future to advise them of the selection procedures for these areas.</P>

	<P>In the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005, I have made detailed provisions for the making of Disciplinary Regulations for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>In its report earlier this year, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act Implementation Group, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, acknowledged the requirement for changes to the Garda disciplinary regulations to coincide with the coming into operation of the Garda Ombudsman Commission.  The Group was strongly of the view that the opportunity should be taken for a comprehensive revision of the Garda disciplinary framework so as to bring it into line with modern practice in human resource management.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, on 19th of May 2006, the Government statement regarding Reports of the Morris Tribunal acknowledged and accepted the views of the Tribunal that the current disciplinary regulations need to be replaced by a new less complex approach which will be swift and fair with a simple appeal process.</P>
        <P>On 17 August, on publication of the 3rd, 4th and 5th reports of the Morris Tribunal, I published new draft Garda Discipline Regulations which were drawn up in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  These draft regulations take account of the recommendations of the Morris Tribunal, follow well-established principles in the public sector and beyond, and are significantly more streamlined than existing Garda Discipline Regulations.  The new draft regulations have been put into the Garda Conciliation Council for discussion with the Garda representative associations and, in recognition of the fundamental changes now proposed, I have made available additional time beyond the original target date of the Summer recess.  I do expect, however, those discussions to be concluded promptly and effectively, and I will bring final proposals to Government for approval in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Fourth Annual Report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention and the Report of the Inspection of Cloverhill Prison which were published by me in August, 2006.</P>
        <P>At the outset I would like to recall that these reports coincided with a period of profound change in the Prison Service during which the decades long problem of dependency on excessive prison overtime was finally confronted &mdash; a confrontation which unavoidably impacted on long developed prisoner regimes.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a situation had developed in the Prison Service whereby the capital budget and every other budget within the system was being cannibalised to fund overtime expenditure.  This reached a peak in 2003 when &euro;60 million was spent on overtime &mdash; approximately 20% of the entire prison budget.</P>
        <P>In order to reverse this wholly unsustainable and incredibly damaging dependence on overtime, I put in place a number of measures including major cutbacks in overtime expenditure and new attendance arrangements.  These measures led to cuts, for necessary operational reasons, in services to prisoners in the period covered by the Inspector&rsquo;s reports.</P>
        <P>However, following prolonged negotiations the POA, in August 2005, accepted a proposal for organisational change eliminating overtime working and introducing new organisational and working arrangements which will provide long term savings to the Exchequer of up to &euro;25m per annum.  These new arrangements will not only restore but actually enhance prisoner regimes in the years ahead, particularly in terms of improving access to services, the availability of better facilities, and making more productive use of out-of-cell time for prisoners.</P>
        <P>In this regard, much progress has been made in the last 12 months in improving educational and workshop facilities for prisoners including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the refurbishment of 5 workshops in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution which will lead to FETAC accreditation in metal work, woodwork, computers, industrial cleaning and other industrial skills.  The new workshops will give constructive activity to over 70 inmates and the rollout of the opening <Col N="1378"/>of these new workshops is almost complete; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the refurbishment of Cloverhill Education Centre which has recently been completed.  Classes have now commenced and courses are being rolled out on a phased basis.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Fourth Annual Report of the Inspector covers the period April 2005 &mdash; April 2006 and deals with a wide range of issues including staffing levels, the establishment of an Inspector of Prisons on a statutory footing, prisoners rights to vote, the privatisation of prisons, recidivism, drug addiction and prisoners with psychiatric illnesses.</P>
        <P>In relation to shortcomings in conditions, the Inspector calls in his report for the immediate closure of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  The lack of modern facilities at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution has been the subject of justified criticism not only by the Inspector of Prisons but also by other oversight and monitoring bodies.  The Government shares the views expressed that St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is no longer suitable as a place of detention for young people and that its complete replacement is required.  The Institution, together with other detention facilities on the Mountjoy Prison complex, will be closed as soon as planned new facilities are constructed on a green field site at Thornton Hall, Co. Dublin.  Separate facilities will be available at Thornton Hall for 16 and 17 year old boys.  The new campus will allow us to develop progressive rehabilitative programmes, introduce enhanced educational facilities and to introduce single occupancy cells with in-cell sanitation to end the practice of slopping out.</P>
        <P>The development of the new prison campus will also provide the Irish Prison Service with room for future expansion ensuring that there is no return to the revolving door of the mid 1990s when the Rainbow Government presided over a situation with 20% of prisoners on temporary release.  By way of comparison, on 28 September, 2006 there were 3,314 persons in the prison system, of whom 156 (4.7%) were on temporary release.  The reason for the significant fall in the percentage of prisoners on temporary release between 1996 and 2006 is because this Government has provided some 1,100 net additional prison spaces since 1997.  In addition, over 400 new places are in the process of being provided for at Shelton Abbey, Loughan House, Castlerea, Portlaoise and Wheatfield Prisons.</P>
        <P>The Inspector also calls for the elimination of drugs in prisons and the introduction of sniffer dogs in prisons such as Mountjoy.  As the Deputy is aware the elimination of drugs in our prisons is one of my key priorities.  In order to achieve this, a Drug Detection Dog was introduced into the prison system earlier this year.  The service is based in the Midlands Prison and it is planned that trials will be carried out from that base across the estate.  This initial phase is being used to test the effectiveness of drug dogs in Irish <Col N="1379"/>Prisons and also to act as a learning exercise for the Irish Prison Service to refine its precise approach in a wider deployment.  The pilot has proved extremely successful to date and the dog has detected significant numbers of smuggling attempts and also acts as a strong deterrent to such activities.  It is intended that the Drug Detection Dog will be used in Mountjoy in the near future.</P>
        <P>However, Drugs Detection Dogs are just one of a much wider range of measures contained in the new Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy which I launched earlier this year.  The new Policy &amp; Strategy provides, for the first time, a co-ordinated and consistent national approach to dealing with the thorny problem of  the supply of drugs as well as ensuring that appropriate treatment is available to prisoners to help them conquer their addiction.  The Policy is currently being rolled out across the prison system.</P>
        <P>The new replacement Mountjoy and Munster prison complexes will also be constructed with an extensive perimeter to prevent drugs being thrown over the wall thus facilitating drug-free regimes.</P>
        <P>In relation to prisoners with psychiatric illnesses, the Inspector expressed concern regarding the treatment of mentally ill prisoners and prisoners with personality disorders and recommends that the Department of Health and Children take responsibility for such prisoners.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service is committed to healthcare standards comparable with those pertaining in the wider community outside prison.  Prisoners have access to medical, nursing, psychiatric, and psychological services within the prison system.  The psychiatric needs of prisoners are serviced by visiting psychiatrists.  The psychiatric service of the Eastern Coast Area Health Board at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum (which is under the management of the HSE and the Department of Health and Children) provide regular weekly counselling and treatment sessions at the Dublin prisons.  In other locations services are provided by local psychiatrists.</P>
        <P>Offenders who, in the opinion of the psychiatrist and the Prison Doctor are in need of in-patient psychiatric treatment, may be transferred by Order to either the Central Mental Hospital or a District Mental Hospital.  However, the Central Mental Hospital is the only psychiatric in-patient hospital that will, in effect, accept prisoners.  Due to increased demand on this facility from various sources in recent years it has frequently been the situation that a waiting list occurs for admission and priority is on clinical need.  This situation arises in spite of general agreement regarding the necessity for admission and, while awaiting a bed to become available, the prison authorities may be left with no alternative but to seek to manage a disturbed individual in conditions which <Col N="1380"/>provide the greatest degree of protection for the individual, for other prisoners, and for staff.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Irish Prison Service is continually engaged with the Department of Health and Children and the HSE in a process aimed at co-ordinating the provision of Healthcare (including psychiatric services) to prisoners.</P>
        <P>In relation to the use of padded cells, I have honoured my commitment to abolish the use of old style padded cells with the introduction of newly designed and improved cells.  Special Observation Cells are not used for routine reasons and are only used in cases where a prisoner is in a highly agitated state and where he or she is at risk of harming themselves or others.  No mentally ill prisoner awaiting a move to the Central Mental Hospital is detained in a special cell unless this is unavoidably necessary.  Such a practice is not common place and only takes place where the safety of prisoners require such use.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In August 2005, my Department received a submission from the Garda Commissioner on the resourcing requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The submission was based on the Commissioner&rsquo;s analysis of the policing challenges facing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the medium and longer term, including the implications of demographic change, the need to continue to combat crime and terrorist threats, and the requirements for enhanced enforcement of road traffic law and immigration control.  In the submission, the Commissioner proposed the future expansion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000 full time members.  He also proposed the expansion of the Garda overtime budget, the creation of a Garda Reserve and additional civilian support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </P>
        <P>On these last three issues, strong action has been taken.  The 2006 Garda overtime budget allocation has risen by &euro;22.4 million to &euro;83.5 million, an increase of 36.6% over the original allocation of &euro;61.1 m in 2005.  I have made the necessary regulations providing for the establishment of a Garda Reserve and recruitment and training of Reserve Members is underway.  As I outlined in an answer to another question today, significant progress has also been made on providing additional civilian support for An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>On the issue of an increase in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000, the priority now is to complete the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government.  This has involved a major redevelopment of the facilities at the Garda College, almost doubling its student capacity.  The recruitment programme is fully on target, and will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>I am now giving careful consideration to the case made by the Garda authorities for a continuation of the current intensive recruitment drive beyond the target of 14,000.  I do not want to anticipate the decision of Government, but I can say that I recognise the strength of the case made by the Commissioner and his colleagues and that I attach considerable weight to their arguments.</P>

If the Court makes a finding that a person is not fit to be tried that person cannot be committed to a prison.  If a person is found not guilty by reason of insanity that person cannot be committed to a prison.</P>
        <P>The Prison Service must accept all persons committed into their custody on foot of legal orders of the Courts.  A person committed to prison may have or develop a mental illness.  The Criminal Law (Insanity) Act, 2006 provides that where on the basis of medical assessment, a prisoner is considered to require specialist treatment that cannot be provided in prison that prisoner may be transferred to a designated centre for treatment.  The Central Mental Hospital is currently the only such designated centre.  The question of resources for the CMH is a matter for the Health Service Executive and my Department is currently working closely with both the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive with a view to ensuring that the necessary mental health facilities are available for prisoners.</P><Col N="1383"/>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that my Department has always taken its obligations under the National Archives Act, 1986 very seriously, including of course the general obligation to transfer records that are over 30 years old.  The Act does, however, provide that certain records which are over 30 years old may nevertheless be withheld from transfer on grounds specified under the Act.  These grounds would have applied in respect of a range of sensitive records held by my Department. </P>
        <P>I was concerned, however, that the long- term effect of withholding records from public inspection, done quite legitimately under the criteria set out in the Act, would be to exclude documents of genuine historic value from public scrutiny.  Indeed, this was a concern shared by the senior officials in my Department.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I appointed an Archives Advisory Group in February, 2006, comprising of a number of eminent historians and academic figures, with Professor Mary Daly as Chairperson, to advise me on the historical value of these records and how access to them might be facilitated.  The Group concentrated, initially, on records relating to National Security and Northern Ireland matters up to 1956.  It submitted its first Report to me on 25 September and amongst its conclusions has recommended that these 50 year old records should be transferred to the National Archives over the next 12 months.</P>
        <P>I have accepted this recommendation and look forward to receiving further reports on the Group&rsquo;s work.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the view expressed by the former Vice-Chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board advocating the establishment of a similar policing authority in this jurisdiction.  The perceived advantage of such an authority is that it interposes an additional layer of independent accountability between the political process and the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </P>
        <P>The idea of such an authority makes perfectly good sense in the context of the UK regional police structure where there is no corresponding regional democratic unit, and in Northern Ireland, of course, where there are unique requirements associated with the need for confidence building in a cross-community environment.</P>
        <P>I believe, however, that where there is a single national police force the case for the setting up of a policing authority to act as a link between democratic institutions and the day to day responsibility for operational policing loses much of its force.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I would contend that this additional layer in our scheme of things would very seriously dilute democratic accountability and political responsibility, as well as the performance and effectiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself.  The relationship between the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas has developed over time.  The accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to this House, both directly and through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has been strengthened by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</P>
        <P>To establish a separate authority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would also raise the question of who should serve on such an authority and how they should be selected.  I believe it is more appropriate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be accountable to the Government and to the Oireachtas &mdash; which are fully representative of Irish society &mdash; than to an unelected body.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish law relating to prosecution appeals has been the subject of scrutiny in recent times.  As the Deputy may be aware, in this jurisdiction there exists only a limited prosecution right of appeal against an acquittal.  This situation has its origins in the common law rule against double jeopardy, i.e. that no-one should be tried twice for the same offence.  The existence of this rule does not, however, prohibit the introduction of statutory provisions allowing for a prosecution right of appeal against acquittal.  For example, a prosecution right of appeal in relation to cases tried on indictment is contained in section 34 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, as amended by section 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  This section provides for a prosecution right of appeal on a point of law which arose during the trial of an acquitted person. This right of appeal is without prejudice i.e. it cannot interfere with the decision to acquit the accused. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy points out the United Kingdom has introduced legislative provisions, contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2003,  which provide for an exception to the double jeopardy rule for certain serious offences.  A prosecutor in that jurisdiction is empowered, subject to the written consent of the DPP in that jurisdiction, to apply to the Court of Appeal for an order quashing a person&rsquo;s acquittal and ordering a re-trial.  The DPP may only consent to the making of the application if certain conditions are met, including that there is new and compelling evidence and that it is in the public interest.</P>
        <P>I mentioned earlier that the system of prosecution appeals in this jurisdiction has been under examination.  In May 2002 the Law Reform Commission issued a Consultation Paper on the subject of prosecution appeals.  The Commission stated in that paper that it is strongly of the view that Irish law should move from a near token system of prosecution appeals to one in which prosecution appeals would represent a real and substantial element in the criminal process.  It further sets out five possible options for reform ranging from a narrow without prejudice model to a comprehensive with prejudice model.  It is expected that the Commission will publish a final report detailing its recommendations later this year.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the ongoing work of the Commission I have taken the opportunity to bring to the attention of the Commission the question of allowing for an appeal mechanism whereby an acquittal may be set aside and a person retried.  I should point out that the introduction of such a provision in this jurisdiction would constitute a fundamental change and requires <Col N="1386"/>careful consideration.  I would therefore propose to await the views of the Law Reform Commission before bringing forward any legislative proposals on the matter.</P>

        <P>I expect that the Bill will be published early next year.  After publication, its legislative progress will be in the Hands of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The D&aacute;il Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights will have an opportunity to consider the Bill in detail during the Committee Stage of its progress through the D&aacute;il.  Should the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights wish to consider the Scheme of the Bill in advance of that process, it is open to that Committee to do so of its own initiative.</P>
        <P>I expect that publication of the Scheme will stimulate wide public debate on the shape of immigration law and policies in the State and I look forward to receiving comments and suggestions for the legislation, from whatever source, over the coming months.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 191 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has responsibility for 16 and 17 year old children who have been ordered to be detained by the Courts, the majority of these are male and detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution which accommodates 16 to 21 year olds.  In addition, each of the prisons in the State can accommodate persons aged 17 years and over and the Courts have discretion to commit 17 year olds directly to prison.  This can often happen at the request of the person&rsquo;s legal team in order for them to be located nearer to their family home.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that their records indicate that there was a total of 276 persons aged under the age of 18 years committed to their custody during 2005, of which 214, or 78%, were committed to St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  I understand that on average last year there were, at any one time, approximately 60 male children and 1 female child detained in facilities under the remit of the Irish Prison Service and that on 22 September 2006 there were 50 male children being detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and 10 male and 2 female children being detained in adult prisons.</P>
        <P>Following a review of the youth justice system the Government agreed, in December 2005, a number of reforms including amendments to the Children Act 2001 and the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service.  The Irish Youth Justice Service has been established as an executive office of my Department and is to, <i>inter alia</i>, manage detention services for young people under the age of 18 years.  The legislative, operational and administrative changes will see the transfer of responsibility for the detention of young offenders under 18 years of age, ordered to be detained by the Courts, from the Department of Education and Science and the Irish Prison Service to the Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department.  The net effect of these reforms to the detention services will be to end the practice of using adult prison places for the detention of children and to extend the children detention school model to all offenders under the age of 18 years.</P>
        <P>The development and construction of children detention school places which can accommodate 16 and 17 year old children with the requisite facilities to provide care and education will take some time to complete.  In the interim, work is well underway in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution for the separation of the majority of children under the <Col N="1388"/>age of 18 years from the older age groups.  Planning for commencement of the Children Act 2001, as amended, is being carried out through the close co-operation of the Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department and officials in the Departments of Education and Science, and Health and Children.  In addition the Government has agreed to the recruitment of a National Manager for Detention School Services for the Irish Youth Justice Service and I understand that this appointment will be made shortly.  A cross- departmental group has been formed to plan for the development of detention places needed to implement the changes under the Children Act, as amended.  The transfer of the schools which are currently within the remit of the Department of Education and Science to the remit of the Irish Youth Justice Service will take place in 2007.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of any mistreatment of 16 and 17 year old children in custody in the prison system or of any reports of such mistreatment.  I can say that any such reports would be treated with the utmost seriousness.  If the Deputy has details of any alleged mistreatment, he should pass them to my Office and I will undertake to have them investigated.  Prisoners may make a complaint about treatment in custody through a number of channels, including local prison management, the Prison Visiting Committee, the Inspector of Prisons, the Minister, and he or she also has access to the Courts.  They may also complain to the European Court of Human Rights and to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.  In the cases where allegations of assault are made, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are called to investigate.</P>
        <P>At a recent examination by the United Nations on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, my colleague, Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D., Minister for Children, made clear the results to date of our joint initiative to reform the youth justice sector, including measures to deal with the detention of young people in prisons.  Minister Lenihan also underlined this Government&rsquo;s determination to implement the changes I have described here.</P>

	<P>The Garda authorities advise me that 131 Garda stations have audio/video-recording interview equipment out of a total of 703 Garda stations.  </P><Col N="1389"/>
        <P>It was never the intention that all Garda stations would be equipped to carry out audio/video recording of interviews.  Indeed, most Garda stations are not used for detention and interviews.  Rather the intention was that a sufficient number of interview rooms in Garda stations across the country be equipped to provide a broad nationwide coverage.</P>
        <P>Where a Garda station is not equipped with an audio/video system, a person to be interviewed in accordance with the Regulations will be taken to the nearest Garda station with such equipment.  In this context, the Garda authorities have advised me that, in June 2005, a Garda survey indicated that 98.1% of interviews as specified in the Regulations were being recorded.  Interviews are not recorded mainly because either the arrested person declines to have the interview recorded or the equipment is already in use or is otherwise unavailable.</P>
        <P>With regard to future and additional requirements I am advised that the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with my Department, is finalising proposals for the provision of additional audio/video systems.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The total number of prisoners in custody on 28 September, 2006 was 3,158 compared to a bed capacity of 3,383.  This represents an occupancy level of 93%.  There is no  overcrowding crisis or immediate issue relating to the capacity of the prison system.  There is consequently no need for the widespread use of early release simply to ease overcrowding levels.  This is in stark contrast to the situation which prevailed in the mid-1990s where the scandal of the &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; was at its height.  However, we are close to our prison capacity limit and there is a need to upgrade and increase our prison stock.  The Thornton Hall and Spike Island developments are addressing those matters.</P>
        <P>I am aware of allegations to the effect that prisoners are running criminal syndicates from inside prison cells.  I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to implementing all appropriate measures within the law to prevent such activity and to ensure that the contact that prisoners have with the outside world is properly controlled and monitored.</P>
        <P>Prisoner visits in all closed prisons are carefully controlled and held in sight of prison officers.  In <Col N="1390"/>addition, new Visiting Card arrangements are in place in almost all closed prisons whereby only persons who have been pre-approved by the Governor are permitted to visit.  Telephone calls in closed prisons are monitored by prison officers and incoming and outgoing mail is subject to examination by a prison censor.  In addition, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues and I can assure the Deputy that Garda&iacute; would be contacted where any suspected criminal offence has taken place.</P>
        <P>One of the major challenges in prisons today lies in preventing access to contraband items, primarily mobile phones and drugs, which for obvious reasons, are viewed as highly valuable commodities which could assist in illegal activity from the prisoner cells.  Efforts are made on a continuous basis to prevent the flow of such contraband into our prisons, by for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, upgraded CCTV monitoring, the use of screened visits and the use of daily prisoner and cell searches.  In addition, the Prison Service are currently examining technological options for dealing with the use of mobile phones within prisons.</P>
        <P>Random searches of cells and their occupants and searching of correspondence and other items have all intercepted significant quantities of contraband in recent years.  When a person is admitted to prison custody, he or she is searched and prohibited items and money are taken.  Similarly, searching takes place of prisoners returning from court, temporary release or visits.  Searches of prisoners also take place where their behaviour or information received raises suspicions that they may be in possession of contraband.  The new prison estates at Thornton Hall and Spike Island will also make it harder for contraband to enter the prison over the perimeter walls by means of locating recreation yards away from perimeter walls.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there have been 16 murders with firearms since the beginning of this year to 30 September.</P>
        <P>All killings regardless of the circumstances involved are the subject of a rigorous investigation by the Garda authorities.  I am informed that Garda management analyses available intelligence and selects targets involved in serious criminal activity, particularly gun-related crime.  Intelligence-led operations against targets are used by Garda management to combat this type of criminal activity on an ongoing basis.  This involves the strategic deployment of both local and specialised Garda operation units to counter such activities.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in recorded crime in the target crime areas under the operation.  An example of a recent success is the operation carried out in the Moyross area last week, in which four arrests were made and four firearms (two rifles and two sawn off shotguns) and a quantity of ammunition were seized.</P>
        <P>In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.</P>
        <P>New mandatory sentences of up to 10 years for possession of firearms with intent to endanger life and other related offences are contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 and are due to be commenced with effect from the beginning of November this year.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced the establishment within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the Traffic Corps on 23 November, 2004.  A Strategic Review of Traffic Policing was also published on that date.  In line with the recommendations contained in that review an Assistant Commissioner Traffic was appointed on 22 February 2005.</P>
        <P>The Assistant Commissioner in charge of Traffic has been tasked with implementing the recommendations contained in the Strategic Review of Traffic Policing which will see 1,200 personnel attached to the Traffic Corps by 2008.  This increase of personnel is taking place on a phased basis as the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increases to 14,000.  At the start of 2006, the total dedicated strength of the Garda Traffic Corps stood at 520 all ranks.  The current strength stands at 740, with an additional 60 members to be allocated during the remainder of 2006.  These allocations will continue until the target strength of 1,200 is achieved.</P>
        <P>I am  informed that Garda Traffic Corps personnel are allocated to each Garda Division and are engaged in achieving the strategic objectives contained in the Strategic Review of Traffic Policing which will contribute to reducing road fatalities and casualties, improve traffic flow, enforce road traffic legislation effectively and consistently as well as enforcing road transport and haulage legislation effectively and consistently using available technologies.  The Traffic Corps are also engaged in providing appropriate policing support and response to the National Development Plan provisions relating to traffic and transport, providing a systematic and structured road traffic collision service and providing accurate timely and sufficiently detailed information to key stakeholders.</P>
        <P>While the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Traffic Corps are specifically dedicated to traffic duties, they remain police officers will full powers and as such retain the general responsibility for preventing and detecting crime which all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have. <Col N="1393"/> Similarly members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not members of the Traffic Corps have the responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, to deal with traffic duties when breaches of road traffic law occur.  Garda&iacute; spend two years training at the Garda College.  The focus of such training is on all areas of policing.  Garda management will not allow a situation to arise where the establishment of the Traffic Corps would lead to the Garda&iacute; who are members of it having no regard to other policing duties regardless of seriousness if and when they arise in the course of carrying out their duty, and similarly Garda&iacute; who are not members not having regard to traffic policing duties.</P>
        <P>The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  Of particular relevance in the context of the latest reports of the Tribunal are the new draft discipline regulations which have been drawn up.  These are based on well-established principles in the private and public sector and are significantly more streamlined than the system which is currently in existence.  The next step is for them to undergo consideration by the Garda representative bodies.  Also, arising from the most recent reports, on my instructions regulations for a Whistleblower&rsquo;s charter within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been drawn up and are being finalised in consultation with the Commissioner, the Ombudsman Commission and Garda Inspectorate, as provided for in Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</P>
        <P>Change in our national policing service is being pursued in a vigorous but sensible manner &mdash; I am conscious of the fundamental importance of getting it right.  I intend to do so.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 184 together.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area.  The pur<Col N="1394"/>pose of the committees is to provide a forum where a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area.</P>
        <P>In view of the innovative nature of the committees and the number which will be established, I decided, following consultation with my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to pilot the committees in 22 local authority areas for a limited period.</P>
        <P>I issued the guidelines for these pilot committees in June 2006.  I was anxious to strike in the guidelines the right balance between inclusiveness and effectiveness in the size and composition of the committees.  With regard to membership of the committees by local authority members, the guidelines provide either for all local authority members to be members of a committee or for representation of each political grouping on the local authority, depending on the size of the local authority.  Because of the size of its population, the Dublin City Council area has in addition to an overall committee five sub-committees, corresponding to the Council&rsquo;s five operational areas.  The guidelines provide for membership by all the local authority members for the appropriate area on the relevant subcommittee.  With regard to the overall committee, they provide that each political grouping represented on the Council be represented to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas members represented on a committee are chosen from among their number by those members of the Oireachtas who have registered their interest in being a member of that committee.  If the members of the Oireachtas are unable to choose members, they are chosen by lot.</P>
        <P>The pilot phase will end in mid-2007, after which there will be a time-limited review of the guidelines in the light of the experience of the pilot committees.  As part of that review, the provisions regarding the composition of the committees will be considered.  Following the review, the guidelines will be amended as necessary and new guidelines issued for a full rollout of the committees.</P>

This recommendation has been accepted by me and was implemented immediately by the prison authorities.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday 8 September following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of <Col N="1396"/>10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>The personnel strength of the Limerick division as at the 31st of December, 2002 was 460 Garda&iacute; (all ranks).  The personnel strength of the Limerick Division as at the 27th September, 2006 was 512 Garda&iacute; (all ranks).  This represents an increase of 52 Garda&iacute; (or 11.3%) in the number of personnel allocated to the Limerick Division since the 31st of December 2002.</P>
        <P>The Moyross area of Limerick is policed by Garda&iacute; attached to Mayorstone Park Garda Station.  The personnel strength (all ranks) of Mayorstone Garda Station as at 31 December, 2002 and  27 September, 2006 was 41 and 49, respectively.  This includes one (1) Sergeant and three (3) Garda&iacute; allocated to Mayorstone Garda Station on the 21st September, 2006.  This represents an increase of 8 (or 19.5%) during that period.  An additional one (1) Garda is due to be allocated to Mayorstone Park Garda Station with effect from the 10th October, 2006.</P>
        <P>Local Garda Management report that the issues surrounding the provision of policing resources to the Moyross area have been given priority attention by Garda Management in Limerick over the past several years.  The policing plan in place for the Moyross area of Limerick City is most comprehensive and this has been the situation for some time to allow Garda management monitor criminal activity.  Additional resources have been provided to the Moyross area as occasions have demanded from time to time and Garda personnel have dealt professionally with all of the incidents that have arisen in this general area.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that apart from routine patrols conducted by uniformed and plain-clothes units based at Mayorstone Garda Station, a number of additional patrolling initiatives are in place to deal with the unique policing situation in Moyross.  A dedicated uniform mobile patrol, consisting of 1 Sergeant and 2 Garda&iacute;, perform<?oasys _jy ?>a specific night-time patrol of the Moyross<?oasys _jy ?>area.</P>
        <P>Garda management state that Community policing is an important element of the policing strategy in Moyross.  A vehicle is allocated to the Unit which is utilised, full-time, in the Moyross area.  A well established and active Youth Diversion Project is also in place, for many years, in the Moyross area.</P>
        <P>Garda management further state that there is well established and ongoing liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other leading agencies in Limerick City who provide services for the Moyross area.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to <Col N="1397"/>14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Moyross will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 241 and 246 together.</P>
        <P>As a means of promoting the safety and security of vulnerable client groups, the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU), in liaison with the Health Service Executive (HSE), formerly the Health Boards, has made and continues to make available criminal history vetting in respect of all pro<Col N="1398"/>spective employees of children&rsquo;s residential centres.</P>
        <P>In keeping with sound administrative practice, all vetting applications are processed centrally through the HSE for onward transmission to the GCVU, rather than at a myriad of local levels.</P>
        <P>In recent months, new liaison mechanisms with the GCVU have been successfully implemented within the HSE.  These include, most notably, the centralisation of the HSE&rsquo;s vetting operations, which allows for the development and concentration of expertise in the checking and counter-signing of vetting application forms within the HSE.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the average turnaround time for processing valid vetting requests received by the GCVU has been approximately 4 to 5 weeks.  This represents a marked reduction in processing times over recent years.  By way of comparison, in 2004 and 2005, the average processing period for valid vetting requests was approximately 6 to 8 weeks.  All client organisations of the GCVU are advised of the current processing time frame and have been further advised to allow for it in their recruitment and selection processes.</P>
        <P>In order to facilitate the major, ongoing expansion in the availability of Garda vetting to a range of other employment sectors involving the care of children and vulnerable adults, staffing of the GCVU has already more than doubled in the past year, i.e., from 13 to 30 staff members.  Existing staffing levels are adequate to meet existing demand, but they will be subject to continuing review as expansion proceeds.</P>
        <P>The child protection vetting process involves the disclosure by the GCVU of criminal history information, not so-called soft information such as &lsquo;Garda intelligence&rsquo;, to the recruiting organisation, upon receipt of a written application which necessarily includes the written consent of the person to be vetted to the disclosure.  The disclosed information should constitute only one factor in the recruitment decision, which at all times remains the responsibility of the recruiting organisation rather than the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Disclosure by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is based on common law principles and is performed in accordance with the legal advices of the Attorney General.  Recruiting decisions made by recruiting organisations, which, in part, may be based on disclosed criminal history information, are and will continue to be properly subject to existing employment and other law.  Accordingly, the issue of indemnification does not arise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government places a high priority on putting in place measures aimed at tackling crimes of rape, sexual assault and other crimes of a sexual nature.</P>
        <P>The provisional headline crime statistics for the second quarter of 2006 show sexual offences generally decreased by 28% for the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2005 and 10% for the twelve months up to 30 June compared to the same period for 2005.</P>
        <P>All  sexual offence cases are the subject of rigorous investigation by the Garda&iacute;.  All available resources are employed in respect of all sex offence cases to bring these investigations to a successful conclusion.  Investigation files are forwarded to the Law Officers for a decision as to what charges are to be preferred.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na actively encourages people who are the victims of any crime to report the offence to the Garda&iacute;.  In addition, a number of established initiatives underpin this policy, such as the Garda confidential telephone number, Crimestoppers and Crimecall.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that there is a high attrition rate in rape cases in Ireland and that a large number of cases reported to the Garda&iacute; do not <Col N="1400"/>reach prosecution stage for a variety of reasons.  My Department has approved joint funding for comprehensive research into attrition rates in rape cases.  The research, which is entitled &ldquo;the Understanding of Attrition, Early Withdrawal, the Trial Process and Identifying Possible Changes to Support Complainants in Rape Cases&rdquo;, is being carried out by the Department of Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, over three years and is expected to be completed in 2007/2008.  This research should provide a greater understanding as to why some victims choose not to report cases to the Garda&iacute;, what can be done about under reporting and why, of the cases that are reported, only a relatively small percentage result in a court hearing.</P>
        <P>There are indications that the situation with regard to the listing of cases for trial in the Central Criminal Court has improved.  In 2002, the waiting time between return for trial and trial was 18 months.  By comparison, cases listed in March, 2006 were scheduled for trial  to start on dates in October and November, 2006, that is in 7-8 months.  These improvements can be attributed to the decision of the President of the High Court to assign four judges to the Central Criminal Court on an ongoing basis and to the very active management of the court list.  Already the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate have been appointed &mdash; the composition of both these bodies is indicative of the level of importance which the Government attaches to them.  Staff from my Department have been assigned to each and are currently engaged in putting the necessary infrastructure in place.  I understand that the Commission is working towards being in a position to receive complaints as soon as possible in 2007.</P>
        <P>New Promotion Regulations came into effect on 22 September.  Those regulations will bring about significant modernisation of the system for promotion within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They formalise the requirement for promotion to be based on merit and for all competitions to be held in a manner which is:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="8">(a) fair, impartial and objective,</P>
       <P LI="1" el="8">(b) in line with best practice,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="8">(c) consistent throughout, and</P>
        <P LI="1" el="8">(d) open, accountable and transparent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173, 197 and 200 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda management analyses available intelligence and selects targets involved in serious criminal activity, particularly gun-related crime.  Intelligence-led operations against targets are used by Garda management to combat this type of criminal activity on an ongoing basis.  This <Col N="1402"/>involves the strategic deployment of both local and specialised Garda operation units to counter such activities.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in recorded crime in the target crime areas under the operation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.</P>
        <P>This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  Operations are reviewed on a ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management are satisfied that current resources available are sufficient, with local units being supplemented by personnel from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Organised Crime Unit, the Emergency Response Unit and the Special Detective Unit.</P>
        <P>In addition I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday 8 September following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 183 together.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the time of the Barr Report&rsquo;s publication, it is important that we learn whatever lessons we can from the tragic death of John Carthy.  In this regard, and in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, I have forwarded a copy of the Report to the Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole.  In the light of the Report&rsquo;s findings I have asked her to review Garda procedures and practices for dealing with incidents of the nature that arose in Abbeylara.  In addition, under the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, all fatal shooting incidents involving the Garda&iacute; will automatically be referred to the new Garda Ombudsman Commission.</P>
        <P>However, the improvements that have already been made, both in terms of legislation and those initiatives already adopted by the Garda Commissioner, should not be overlooked.  Legislatively, in addition to the new provisions of the <Col N="1404"/>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 substantially reforms the law in relation to legally and illegally held firearms.  These include amongst other things measures relating to suitability to possess firearms, secure accommodation for firearms, and mandatory sentences for certain firearms offences.</P>
        <P>With regard to &lsquo;less lethal&rsquo; weapons, following the tragedy in Abbeylara the Garda Commissioner appointed a Working Group to consider their use.  The report of this Group was considered by Government in November 2002 and authorisation was granted for the introduction of three types of &lsquo;less lethal&rsquo; weapons for use by the Garda ERU where appropriate, namely bean bag shot, pepper spray device and ferret pepper spray shot.  The Emergency Response Unit has since been equipped with these devices and fully trained in their use.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also commenced a review in relation to response to critical incidents in 2003.  Following this review, a Manual of Guidance for On Scene Commanders, outlining policy and procedures for dealing with critical incidents, was approved in May 2005.  To date twenty-nine officers of Superintendent and Inspector rank have completed the On Scene Command training.  In addition, as part of its Critical Incident Response Programme, discussions are continuing between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive on the provision of specialist medical assistance at critical incidents in the form of psychological experts.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Garda Commissioner has assured me that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are examining Mr Justice Barr&rsquo;s report carefully and comprehensively with a view to addressing the issues which arise.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 207 together.</P>
        <P>The publication of the third fourth and fifth reports of the Morris Tribunal underlined the absolute necessity for the Government to continue to implement its radical reform programme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This reform process had its origins in the publication of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill in 2003.  Nothing in the latest Morris reports negate in any way the vigorous approach taken since then &mdash; in fact the reports emphasise the need to redouble our efforts to ensure that the ongoing process of change continues apace.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 represents a fundamental restatement of the oversight and accountability relationship which has existed between my Department and the Garda&iacute; since 1922.  It goes to the very core of policing &mdash; recasting in statute form the formal relationship between the Executive, the Minister, the Oireachtas and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as the Force&rsquo;s relationship with local Government.  It imposes a clear statutory duty on every member of the force, when required to do so by a member of higher rank, to account for his or her action or inaction while on duty.  Failure to do so is sufficient to ground disciplinary action which may lead to dismissal.</P>
        <P>Already the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate have been appointed &mdash; the composition of both these bodies is indicative of the level of importance which the Government attaches to them.  Staff from my Department have been assigned to each and are currently engaged in putting the necessary infrastructure in place.  I understand that the Commission is working towards being in a position to receive complaints as soon as possible in 2007.</P><Col N="1406"/>
        <P>New Promotion Regulations came into effect on 22 September.  Those regulations will bring about significant modernisation of the system for promotion within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They formalise the requirement for promotion to be based on merit and for all competitions to be held in a manner which is:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) fair, impartial and objective,</P>
       <P LI="1">(b) in line with best practice,</P>
        <P LI="1">(c) consistent throughout, and</P>
        <P LI="1">(d) open, accountable and transparent.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These principles, combined with the introduction of additional external expertise in selecting candidates for promotion within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will result in a system which reflects current best practice.</P>
        <P>In the wake of the recent reports, and with the agreement of the Commissioner, I have appointed a four person civilian expert group, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, to advise him on the development of management and leadership skills for senior officers, the promotion of a culture of performance management and accountability, the development of human resource management and succession planning and the development of specialist skills and enhanced training for members and staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Of particular relevance in the context of the latest reports of the Tribunal are the new draft discipline regulations which have been drawn up.  These are based on well-established principles in the private and public sector and are significantly more streamlined than the system which is currently in existence.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 187 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that at present, there are 87 Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers and 8 Juvenile Liaison Officer Sergeants working in various Divisions throughout the country.  In addition to this, the National Juvenile Office has a staff of 1 Superintendent, (the Director of Diversion Programme), 1 Inspector and 2 Sergeants.</P>
        <P>JLOs are responsible for implementing the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme, which provides an opportunity to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity.  It operates on a nationwide basis under the supervision and direction of the Garda National Juvenile Office, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2.  The Programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age, who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident, may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution.</P>
        <P>The Children Act, 2001 provides a statutory basis for the Juvenile Diversion Programme.  The Programme came into operation on 1 May, 2002 and now includes provision on restorative cautioning and conferencing which form part of the comprehensive restorative elements of the Act.  The Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, who are responsible for administering the Programme at the local level.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for a change to the age of criminal responsibility and for the introduction of behaviour orders for children.  Officials of the Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department have begun consultations with the Garda authorities on the effect and resource implications which these changes will have on the work of the Juvenile Diversion Programme.  These provisions have not yet been commenced.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Juvenile Diversion Programme, there are also 64 Garda Youth Diversion Projects nationwide.  Garda Youth Diversion Projects aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature.  These projects cater for approximately 2,500 participants per annum and are particularly targeted at <Col N="1408"/>10-18 year old &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified.  The allocation of funding for the 64 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (along with 7 Local Drug Task Force Projects) in 2006 is just over &euro;6.6 million, which is an increase of &euro;1.2 million on 2005.</P>
        <P>It is my intention  to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.  Recently, I  announced the establishment of ten new projects in the first phase of the expansion of the scheme, bringing the total number of projects to 74.  The ten new projects are located in Blanchardstown, Birr, Carlow, Castlebar, Cavan, Clondalkin, Limerick, Tallaght and Tralee (two projects).  The appointment of additional Juvenile Liaison Officers for these projects is under consideration.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am actively pursuing the only viable long term remedy to the problems to which the Deputy refers, through constructing new prison facilities in Dublin and Munster.  I hope that I can have the support of the Deputy and his colleagues in this regard.  The new facilities will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work training, education and medical services as well as providing predominantly single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation facilities.  These are major undertakings involving replacement of close to 40% of the entire prison estate.  They will take a number <Col N="1409"/>of years to complete but it is my intention that they will proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>In the interim appropriate strategic measures are being taken.   As the major committal prison in the State, Mountjoy was susceptible to short term pressures on accommodation arising from sudden influxes of prisoners sentenced by the Courts, sometimes late in the evening.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 September 2006, I have designated Wheatfield Prison and the Midlands Prison as committal prisons for certain male adult prisoners sentenced by courts.  This will significantly reduce the numbers being committed to Mountjoy in the first instance and make for a somewhat more stable and manageable prisoner population there.</P>
        <P>In addition the two holding cells in the B Base Mountjoy have been closed.  One of the cells is being converted into a 4 shower unit for prisoners accommodated in the Base.  The other cell is being refurbished to provide one single occupancy cell.  A2 and A3 landings of Mountjoy prison are to be re-opened following refurbishment.  There are 42 cells on each landing.  The re-opening of these landings will result in a significant increase in the number of single occupancy cells in the prison.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have appointed Mr. Michael Mellett to conduct an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death in Mountjoy and to make appropriate recommendations.  I await his report.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach and I met representatives of the Stardust Victims Committee on 18 September.  The purpose of the meeting was to hear from the Committee regarding the detailed submission made by them during the summer, in which they set out their case for a new public inquiry into the tragedy.  We emphasised that we did not wish to finalise our thinking on this issue until we had heard at the meeting from the families in person and that a formal response would issue once their submissions, both written and verbal, had received detailed examination and consideration.</P>

	<P>The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 sets out the obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences.  A convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison. </P>
        <P>Thereafter, the offender must notify the Garda&iacute; of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more s/he must inform the Garda&iacute; of this fact and the address at which s/he intends to stay and also notify the Garda&iacute; of his/her return.  If s/he did not intend to stay away for more than seven days but did, s/he must inform the Garda&iacute; within a further seven days.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries.</P>
        <P>It is an offence to fail to comply with the notification requirements.  The penalty is imprisonment for up to 12 months or a fine of &euro;1,900 or both.</P>
        <P>The information provided by persons subject to the notification requirements set out in the Act is held centrally at the Garda Domestic Violence and Sexual Assaults Investigation Unit.  It is accessible to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including nominated Garda Inspectors in each Garda Division who have responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 in their Division.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 are kept under regular review by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department with a view to ensuring they are operating in a satisfactory manner.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department recognises the enormous challenges facing Irish society today as a result of the major demographic changes that have occurred in recent <Col N="1412"/>years.  These challenges are particularly acute since these changes have not been gradual.  Indeed, recent statistics indicate that newcomers may now account for up to 10% of the population.</P>
        <P>As part of the response to these changes, in 2005 I established the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service &mdash; INIS for short, which brings together the various strands of Government activity which have a direct bearing on immigration and integration issues.  Within these revised structural arrangements, a new framework is now being finalised under which INIS will exercise its responsibility for promoting and coordinating all social and organisational measures across the whole spectrum of Government for the acceptance of lawful immigrants into Irish economic and cultural life.</P>
        <P>A new Integration Unit within INIS is also being established to carry out this specific function.  The Unit will work with other Departments on studies and projects which have a major leverage effect on overall integration objectives.  It will also assist in the development of a broad integration policy, building comprehensive strategies that will be linked with progress already achieved in the areas of social inclusion and anti-racism.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year I announced an Integration Fund of &euro;5m to accelerate the process of ensuring that all newcomers to Ireland can develop their full potential in the context of a new integrated society.  Local Partnership Companies involved in the social inclusion area and Non Government Organisations with expertise in the area of integration will be involved in the implementation of this initiative.  The Fund will also be made available for a range of research and mapping initiatives and will be used to accelerate the implementation of the National Action Plan against Racism which already has a significant integration element.</P>
        <P>The Reception &amp; Integration Agency (RIA) has responsibility for the coordination of integration services for refugees and persons with leave to remain and is actively involved with stake-holders at all levels both statutory and non-statutory to ensure that the needs of that client group are identified and addressed.</P>
        <P>A high-level Inter-Departmental Working Group, coordinated by the RIA, was established in 2005 to oversee the integration of refugees admitted under resettlement programmes.  While the brief of this Inter-Departmental Working Group refers to refugees admitted under resettlement programmes, many of the issues which arise apply also to other newcomer minority groups.</P>
        <P>Most integration occurs at a local and community level and the RIA are actively involved with Local Authorities, County Development Boards, and Partnership Companies to promote the development of integration strategies within their Social Inclusion remit.</P><Col N="1413"/>
        <P>In May of this year the RIA, in cooperation with the Department of Education &amp; Science, held a 1 day seminar entitled &ldquo;Towards a National English Language Policy for Adult Newcomers&rdquo; designed to bring together core English language providers and other key stakeholders.  Further detailed research is now being undertaken in this area to capitalise on the results of the seminar.</P>
        <P>The RIA is also working with the Department of Community Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs and Pobal (Dormant Accounts programme) to develop targeted initiatives to promote the integration of refugees with a particular focus on parents of Irish-born children who were granted leave to remain last year.</P>
        <P>The needs of this client group is also being addressed by the NDP Gender and Equality Unit of my Department who have provided funding to facilitate access to training and employment.  Ireland has developed one of the most comprehensive anti-discrimination codes in Europe and the National Action Plan against Racism (NAPR) to which I have already referred continues to provide strategic direction to combat racism and to develop a more inclusive, intercultural society in Ireland.  It is based on a commitment to inclusion by design and not as an add-on or afterthought and its focus is on five objectives &mdash; participation, inclusion, provision, recognition and protection.  The plan will run until 2008.</P>
        <P>A Strategic Monitoring Group, coordinated by my Department, with representatives of the social partners, NGOs and Government has been established to oversee implementation of the NAPR measures.  The Group has established three working groups from its members and each group has brought in further expertise as required thereby directly involving people from minority ethnic backgrounds in policy implementation in specific projects.</P>
        <P>A network of Liaison Officers in Government Departments has been established and a wide range of projects are already well advanced.  These include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Development of intercultural school guidelines: Guidelines for primary school teachers have been completed and post-primary guidelines are expected to be published very soon.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Developing anti-racist and diversity (ARD) plans: The first ARD Plan is already in operation in Galway.  Work is currently underway with Roscommon County Council, Dublin Inner City, Fingal County Council and Louth County Council.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Cooperation with the Garda&iacute;: Under the auspices of NAPR, the first Intercultural Consultative Forum was held on the 6th September and involved representatives of <Col N="1414"/>minority communities and the Traveller communities.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Research into racism and the criminal law:  This is being carried out by the Law School, University of Limerick and is due to be completed in November this year.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Using sport for integration: A Grant Scheme with Local Sports Partnerships to develop integration projects is now under way.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Promoting Anti-Racist Workplace Week: 2005 was the sixth year of the Anti-Racist Workplace Week.  The purpose of the week is to raise awareness of the need to combat racism in organisations and promote support  for the accommodation of diversity in the workplace.  The week is organised by the Equality Authority in close partnership with this Department, NAPR steering group, IBEC, ICTU, the Construction Industry Federation, the Small Firms Association, Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and the Irish Farmers Association.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Finally, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that while my Department continues to develop integration initiatives in accordance with its mandate, a whole range of measures are continually being undertaken by other Departments in terms of both services and funding.  I believe that the broad social inclusion programme being pursued by this Government will be of major influence in addressing the important challenge referred to by the Deputy.</P>

The new headquarters building for <Col N="1416"/>the Irish Prison Service is scheduled to be completed and ready for occupation in the first half of 2007.

	<P>The Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2006, which was enacted on 18 May last, amends the Parental Leave Act 1998 to implement agreed recommendations in the Report of the Working Group <Col N="1417"/>on the Review of the Parental Leave Act 1998.  It also implements an increase in the maximum age limit of an eligible child to 8 years, agreed subsequent to the publication of the Report in the context of the Sustaining Progress Partnership Agreement.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the Bill, as initiated in the Seanad on 16 December, 2004, amended section 6 of the 1998 Act by substituting it with a new section 6 to take account of a number of changes in relation to the entitlement to parental leave i.e. increase in the upper age limit of an eligible child, extension of the provisions to include adopting parents and persons acting in loco parentis of an eligible child.</P>
        <P>However, at Report stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, an Opposition amendment was accepted which inserted a new section to the Bill which amends section 6(7) of the 1998 Act to allow for the transfer of parental leave between parents where both parents are employed by the same employer.</P>
        <P>This amendment was technically flawed, as the new section 3 seeks to amend a subsection which was deleted and substituted by the text of subsection 2 of the Bill (now Act).  It was not possible to correct the problem with the text before enactment, without creating further delay to the enactment of the Bill.</P>
        <P>While the amendment itself does not pose a difficulty in principle, I acknowledge that it confuses the issue regarding the transferability of parental leave.  I intend to seek Government approval for an amending provision, to be included in a suitable legislative instrument, at an early date.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the total number of murder offences where a firearm was used, recorded, detected, proceedings commenced and convictions for the years 1998 to 2005 and up to 1 October, 2006.</P>

The rate of murder/manslaughter in Ireland in 1995 was 1.47 per 100,000 of the population.  The comparative figure for 2005 is 1.41 per 100,000 of the population.  A wide range of provisions to combat gun crime were introduced in the Criminal Justice Act, 2006.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that murders involving the use of firearms tend to have lower conviction rates than other murders.  This is not unique to Ireland.  I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the highest priority is given by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the investigation of murders and the detection of those responsible.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is statutorily independent in the performance of his functions.  Furthermore, judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on their decisions.</P><Col N="1417"/>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the action he will take to deal with vandalism and anti-social behaviour which is causing major problems in many communities with families harassed and property vandalised; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns expressed about anti-social behaviour and its effects on people.  In many such incidents, vulnerable people, often the elderly, are subjected to serious nuisance and forms of harassment which cause significant and persistent distress to the people concerned and interfere fundamentally with their capacity to enjoy quiet and peaceful lives.  Often such people are simply too frightened to stand up to their persecutors.  Equally, few of them have the financial resources to engage lawyers to seek private law injunction-type remedies to protect their rights to enjoyment of their property.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 contains provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour.  The Act empowers a senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner.</P>
        <P>The relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 will be commenced following consultations between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These consultations are currently ongoing. The purpose of this is to ensure that these provisions will commence as soon as the Commissioner has made the necessary internal arrangements to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.</P>
        <P>Separate provision is being made in relation to young people.  The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act, 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There will be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.  Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the Courts.</P><Col N="1420"/>
        <P>Strong provisions are in place to combat vandalism and anti-social behaviour.  The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I have brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.  One of the provisions of the Act is to broaden the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which was originally introduced to combat under-age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of offences, such as a licensee supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and permitting disorderly conduct on the licensed premises.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licenses, late night clubs and food premises where there is disorder or noise on or close to the premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals convicted of a range of public order offences, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the 1994 Public Order Act.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a pro-active approach to policing anti-social/public disorder issues by immediate intervention, arrest and prosecutions or advice, as appropriate.  Local Garda management provide for this in policing plans and make every effort to provide a highly visible police presence on the streets of our towns and villages through the deployment of uniform Garda&iacute;, detective units, divisional traffic corps, community policing units and mountain bike units as appropriate.  Garda patrols pay particular attention to areas where the public tends to congregate such as licensed venues and fast food outlets while awaiting transport, so as to prevent and detect incidents of public disorder.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that Operation Encounter which was introduced by Garda management in 2002 targets public disorder offences including assaults and drinking by underage persons.</P>
        <P>Under the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme Divisional Juvenile Liaison Officers regularly visit schools, youth clubs and social services to give presentations under the education programme and highlight alternative options for regular offenders.  Community Garda&iacute; and the Garda Schools Liaison Officers also visit schools and address young people on a variety of topics including anti social behaviour.</P>
        <P>Members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are frequently in contact with other Government and non-government agencies, including the Health <Col N="1421"/>Services Executive and the local authorities in order to have a multi agency approach to addressing criminal issues.  This multi agency liaison will continue.</P>
        <P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development and promote civic responsibility.  The Garda Youth Diversion Projects are funded by my Department and administered through Garda Community Relations Section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the 64 Garda youth diversion projects currently in place cater for approximately 2,500 participants per annum.  The allocation of funding for the 64 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (along with 7 Local Drug Task Force Projects) in 2006 is just over &euro;6.6 million, which is an increase of &euro;1.2 million on 2005.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.  Recently, I announced the establishment of ten new projects in the first phase of the expansion of the scheme, bringing the total number of projects to 74.  The ten new projects are located in Blanchardstown, Birr, Carlow, Castlebar, Cavan, Clondalkin, Limerick, Tallaght and Tralee (two projects).</P>

        <Quest> the reason a person (details supplied) was deported despite the fact that one of their children was left here; his views on whether this is a fair system in view of the fact that they were not allowed to remove there belongings or second child; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy is a Nigerian woman who was deported from the State on a charter flight to Lagos on the night of the 20/21 September, 2006.  She arrived in the State on 18 May 2005 and was accompanied by her son, a minor child born on 12 June 2001.  On 18 July 2005 the person concerned gave birth to a second son in the State.  The asylum application of the person concerned and her two children was refused following negative determinations by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Their cases were further considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, including representations on their behalf for leave to remain in the State from the Refugee <Col N="1422"/>Legal Service, before deportation orders were signed.</P>
        <P>Despite the best efforts of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on the day of the removals to maintain the unity of the family, the person concerned refused to co-operate with the Garda&iacute; in locating the whereabouts of all her children.  In the end she was deported accompanied by her youngest child.  It is understood that the elder child, who was hidden from Garda&iacute;, was passed into the care of other local Nigerian nationals by his mother.  I understand that the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) informed the local area Health Service Executive of the position in relation to this child.  I am advised that the GNIB was notified of the whereabouts of the missing child a few days after the charter operation took place.  I am further advised that the child in question is now in the care of the North Western Regional Health Authority and that a Child Care Order hearing in respect of him has been adjourned until 3 October 2006.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the persons concerned were deported following a comprehensive examination of their asylum claims and of their claims to remain temporarily in the State.  It should be pointed out that it was as a consequence of a deliberate choice on the part of  the person concerned that she is now separated from her elder child.  This behaviour by parents cannot form a basis for either non-enforcement or revocation of the deportation orders in this instance.</P>

	<P>The expenditure estimates for my Department contain relatively small provisions for the administration of the Department and of the bodies which come under its aegis and it is anticipated that this funding will be spent during the year in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s operating requirements.</P>
        <P>My Department is closely monitoring expenditure and will continue to do so as year-end approaches and any overall savings identified will of course be made available to the Exchequer.  It is not yet possible to definitively identify the nature and amount of any such savings, as this often depends on the timing of activities and related events.  However, it is not expected that there will be a material level of allocation not required by year end.</P>

	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy has expressed an interest in transferring to a prison in Ireland under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  However, the formal application and necessary supporting documentation has not been received to date from the United Kingdom authorities.  My Department has written to the United Kingdom authorities requesting them to commence processing this individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>The Convention requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered.  A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here.</P>
        <P>These procedures are required under the Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, and must be adhered to in processing each application.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Local Garda Management report that members attached to Dunfanaghy Garda Station attend Creeslough Garda Station to ensure it is open at the specified times, however this is determined by resource availability and the rostered tour of duty of the members attached to Dunfanaghy Garda Station.</P>
        <P>Milford Garda District forms part of the Donegal Division.  In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Garda resources for this Division are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</P><Col N="1425"/>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the area referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 8 (4) (b) also refer.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that against the background of the above statutory provisions, the <Col N="1426"/>State Claims Agency provided a confidential report, concerning Garda driving etc., to the Garda authorities for consideration and discussion between the Agency and the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed that the State Claims Agency is dependent on a strong and good working relationship with the State authorities when it carries out risk reviews.  This has worked extremely well on the basis that the State Claims Agency acts as an agent on behalf of the State authority and that the report becomes the State authority&rsquo;s once it is completed.  The view of the State Claims Agency is that the publishing of such risk reviews might inhibit the capacity of the State Claims Agency to carry out reviews in the future.</P>
        <P>In this particular case, as part of its review, the State Claims Agency looked for appropriate benchmarks to allow it to compare the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with that of an analogous organisation.  Having considered the key characteristics of the Garda driving operation, it was considered that it was not comparable with the driving operations of other emergency services such as ambulances and fire brigades.  Benchmarks which were eventually settled on were found in UK police forces.  As such, I am advised by the State Claims Agency that the findings of the report would not be of particular relevance to other emergency services.  In view of the foregoing I will not be publishing the report at this time.</P>

	<P>There are plans to construct a new Wexford Divisional Headquarters Garda station.</P>
        <P>I understand that the necessary first step in providing the new station, the acquisition of a suitable site, has almost been completed by the Office of Public Works and it is expected that this will be finalised by the end of October, 2006.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities and my Department have undertaken the necessary preparatory work to ensure that the new station will meet the present and future requirements of the Wexford Division.  To this end, at a meeting to discuss and agree the new station&rsquo;s accommodation requirements which took place in Wexford Garda station on the 27th September, 2006, a brief of accommodation requirements was discussed in detail and agreed.  This agreed brief of requirements will be submitted shortly by the Garda authorities and the Office of Public Works will then produce a sketch design scheme for agreement by Garda management and the representative bodies.</P>
        <P>With regard to the expected construction start and completion dates for the new station, I have been advised by the Office of Public Works that preparations for construction is planned to commence early in 2007 and it is envisaged that construction work on the new Wexford Divisional Headquarters Garda station will commence on site at the end of 2007 or early 2008.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the person referred to by the Deputy failed to return to the Training Unit on 20 January, 2006 having been granted a short period of temporary release for humanitarian reasons.  He was returned to prison custody by Garda&iacute; on 5 June, 2006 and was transferred to the Midlands Prison on 8 June, 2006.</P>
        <P>His case was subsequently discussed at a local review meeting in the Midlands Prison.  These meetings facilitate the exchange of information and aid decision making with respect to the management of prisoners&rsquo; sentences.  They are chaired by the Governor with the attendance of senior prison management, Probation staff, chaplains, teachers, other prison staff and an official from the Prisons Service Headquarters.  Following consideration of his case at this meeting a transfer to <Col N="1429"/>Shelton Abbey was approved.  This transfer took place on 17 August, 2006 and was on the basis that he would not benefit from enhanced remission.</P>
        <P>While in Shelton Abbey he made a number of applications for temporary release which were refused.  He absconded from Shelton Abbey on 23 September, 2006 and is, therefore, unlawfully at large.  The Garda&iacute; are now seeking this fugitive.  If past experience is any guide he will be soon returned to prison custody.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for bringing this matter to my attention.  Given the unusual sequence of events and circumstances of this case, I have asked for a full report.</P>

As the individual has not addressed the issues raised by my officials in previous correspondence and has been unable to provide any information or supporting documentation which would resolve this issue, she was advised, in a letter dated 14 August 2006, that it was assumed she no longer wished to pursue citizenship on the  basis of her marriage to an Irish born national.

	<P>The average cost of keeping a prisoner in custody in 2005 was &euro;90,900.  The cost of keeping a prisoner in custody in Portlaoise Prison in 2005 was &euro;240,700.</P>
        <P>The average cost of keeping an offender is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders in those institutions.  These costs include certain items which are fixed no matter what the number of offenders in custody, e.g. utilities, staff salaries, etc.  It also reallocates the cost of central services, e.g. H.Q., Prison Service Training Centre, I.T., etc. to each prison institution.</P>
        <P>The relatively high costs of keeping a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison arises primarily because of the unique nature of the prisoners held there and the consequent security considerations which require a higher staff to prisoner ratio.</P>

        <P>The precise information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  The compilation of these statistics would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to prepare and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  However, I can advise the Deputy that &euro;2.37 m was expended on the administration of the Community Service Order Scheme during 2005, that figure does not include professional, administrative or other ancillary costs.  I can further advise the Deputy that 1,167 Orders were made in 2005 of which 449 persons completed the full number of hours specified in their Order in that year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, section 7(2) of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983 allows an offender, in respect of whom a community service order is made, twelve months to complete his/her specified hours beginning on the date an Order was made.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the norm in Cloverhill Prison is that, with the exception of professional visits, all visitors are separated from prisoners by a screen.  There are specific visiting booths, equipped with telephones, which are available to prisoners or visitors who experience hearing difficulties.  This policy is, in my view, an important tool in preventing contraband from entering the prison system.  The Governor of Cloverhill Prison does, however, have the discretion to authorise special open visits having had regard to a number of factors such as the behaviour of a prisoner and the individual circumstances of any particular prisoner or visitor including facilitating persons with hearing difficulties.</P>

        <Quest> if, in this country or throughout the EU, efforts are being made to deter the use of the Internet for the pursuit of child pornography or people trafficking; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30748/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>By its very nature, the internet lends itself to being used for a wide range of criminal activities.  This can include illegal pornography, racist or hate materials, financial fraud, intimidation or any other criminal activity carried out via the internet.  Combating such illegal, harmful and predatory use of the internet requires a response at national, EU and <Col N="1435"/>wider international levels.  The internet is an international and world-wide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  Measures to combat illegal materials and activities on the internet are, therefore, hampered by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems, and differing societal norms.  Furthermore, new developments in communications technologies allowing for internet access by new means are a regular occurrence.  These are largely positive developments but also bring particular challenges for those charged with protecting against the downsides of the internet.</P>
        <P>A combination of responses, and the co-operation of all the stakeholders, at both national and international level &mdash; legislators, law enforcement, schools, child protection practitioners, parents and guardians &mdash; is essential.  My Department is fully committed to playing its part in a proactive way.  In terms of legislation, in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, Ireland has one of the most robust pieces of legislation anywhere.  Under the Act, the possession, distribution, importation and exportation or sale of all forms of child pornography &mdash; films, video or material in written or auditory form including material produced or transmitted via the internet &mdash; are offences with penalties of up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment.  Mere possession of child pornography can be punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.  Using a child or allowing a child to be used for the production of child pornography is also punishable by up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</P>
        <P>The EU Council adopted a Framework Decision on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography on 22 December 2003.  While I have indicated that the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is a particularly robust legislative measure, this Framework Decision requires some relatively minor amendments to our legislation and these are contained in the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill which is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Among the provisions of the Bill is one that prohibits the sale of children, including through a computer system, for the purpose of the sexual or labour exploitation of a child and other provisions will prohibit the sexual grooming of children, including by means of communication through the Internet.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that they monitor child pornography on the internet and where evidence is available action is taken in accordance with legislation.  Similarly, where evidence becomes available that the internet is used for trafficking of human beings action will also be taken to apprehend those responsible.  Other incidents of child pornography or trafficking in human beings coming to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are fully investigated and where <Col N="1436"/>there is evidence to support a prosecution criminal proceedings are commenced, as directed by the Law Officers.  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that staff from the Computer Crime Investigation Unit (CCIU) in the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation participate in numerous fora where crime prevention advice is given to companies and members of the public on the safe use of the internet.  The Unit provides support to the many operations by other national and local units in targeting paedophiles and others suspected of downloading child pornography in Ireland.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attached to the National Bureau of Investigation augment these units as the volume of work requires.  Computer forensics are carried out by the members attached to the Domestic and Sexual Assault Unit and also by members attached to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation utilising up-to-date forensic software.</P>
        <P>On the structural side, the Government established a working Group in 1997 to examine and report on the whole question of the illegal and harmful use of the internet with particular reference to child pornography.  The Report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful Use of the Internet was published in July 1998.  The main recommendation of the Report was for a system of self-regulation by the Internet Service Provider industry and the components of such a system were to include an Internet Advisory Board (IAB) &mdash; established Feb 2000 &mdash; to promote awareness of Internet downside issues, co-ordinate efforts to combat child pornography on the Internet and monitor the progress of self regulation by the Internet Service Provider industry; a Public Hotline for reporting child pornography (established 1999 and funded by the industry); and an industry Code of Practice and Ethics setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet Service Provider (agreed February 2002 and reviewed in 2004).</P>
        <P>The Internet Advisory Board oversees and monitors progress on anti-child pornography measures, and supervises a self-regulatory regime for the Irish Internet Service Provider industry.  The self-regulatory approach to Internet regulation has been adopted world-wide, and the Internet Advisory Board helps and supports the Irish Internet Service Provider industry to deliver an effective self-regulation environment, in accordance with an agreed Code of Practice and Ethics for the industry.  The Irish Code of Practice and Ethics is recognised throughout Europe as a model of its type.  The Internet Advisory Board&rsquo;s brief also extends to general downside issues on the internet, including general safety for children while on-line, the conduct of research and information campaigns.  The Hotline (<i>www.hotline.ie</i>), funded by the Internet Service Providers&rsquo; Association of Ireland with support from the EU Safer Internet Action Plan, was launched in November 1999 and has been operating since that time. <Col N="1437"/> Special protocols operate between the Garda&iacute; and the Hotline that maximise co-operation on law enforcement issues so that offences in the area of child pornography can be detected and prosecuted.  The Hotline works closely with, and is a founding member of, the international INHOPE Association (<i>www.inhope.org</i>), a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world.  The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography.  International co-operation is a vital part of the fight against pornography on the internet, and Ireland is fully committed to playing its part.</P>
        <P>In September 2001, the Council of Europe Ministers&rsquo; Deputies approved the first international Convention on Cybercrime.  Ireland signed up to the Convention in June 2002.  The main objective of the Convention is to foster international co-operation in protecting society against cybercrime.  The Convention deals specifically with the distribution of child pornography on the internet, infringements of copyright, computer related fraud and violations of network security.  On 15 September 2006, I announced that Government approval had been obtained to the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  This Bill is being used to give effect to a number of international instruments including the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 2001.  The European Union has taken a strong line on combatting pornography on the Internet.  Since 1999, under the Safer Internet Action Plan, the EU has provided financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children.  A new EU action plan &mdash; Safer Internet Plus &mdash; covering the period 2005 to 2008 and with a budget of &euro;45m, was agreed under the Irish Presidency in June 2004 and is now in operation.  My Department is represented at the management committee for the programme.  My Department is fully committed to co-operating with and promoting these measures nationally, at EU level and the wider international level.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday 8 September following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management are satisfied that resources allocated to Tallaght Garda Station are reviewed on an on-going basis and are deployed in-line with demand and crime trends, to ensure that a quality service is provided to the local community.  The total strength of Tallaght Garda Station as at 2 October, 2006 was 173 (all ranks).  The total strength of Tallaght Garda Station as at 31 December, 1997 was 133 (all ranks).  This represents an increase of 40 (or 30%) in the number of personnel allocated to Tallaght Garda Station since that date.  The area referred to, is patrolled by uniform and plain-clothes Garda&iacute; supplemented by Divisional Crime Task Force Units, Divisional Traffic Corps and District and Divisional Drug Units in conjunction with District Community Policing Unit and the Garda Mountain Bike Unit.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that uniform patrols, mobile and foot, pay particular attention to areas where youths tend to congregate including green areas, licensed venues and fast-food outlets.  Garda Management state that Operation &lsquo;Encounter&rsquo; was put in place by the Commissioner in February, 2002 to target offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  Garda authorities state that the current policing plans in the area are designed to achieve, inter alia, the prevention of anti-social and public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life for the residents.  This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area.  It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel <Col N="1441"/>allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the area referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received on the 12th May 2006.  The position in relation to granting long <Col N="1445"/>term residency is as follows: persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension.  In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not exempt the person from employment permit requirements.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  I understand that applications received in April 2006 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, both the Deputy and the person concerned will be notified.  </P>

	<P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy is not yet to hand.  I will communicate it to him as soon as possible.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P><Col N="1446"/>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the areas referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the Government&rsquo;s top policing priorities for 2006 remains that of organised crime, including drug trafficking, and the gun culture associated with it.  Tackling organised crime is achieved through the use of specialist units and targeted, intelligence-led operations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na employ a range of techniques and expertise in the fight against organised crime.  The establishment of specialist Garda units, operating under the Assistant Commissioner in charge of National Support Services, has enabled An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle organised crime effectively. </P>
        <P>The National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is the Garda specialist unit tasked with the role of tackling organised crime.  It carries out this role by conducting intelligence-driven operations in close co-operation with other specialist units including the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members.  The increase in garda numbers which has been achieved will permit senior garda management to deploy these extra resources to target areas of concern.</P>
        <P>In financial terms, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has never been as well resourced, with the 2006 budget reaching a historic high of &euro;1.310 billion. <Col N="1447"/> In particular, the 2006 overtime allocation has risen to &euro;83.5m which represents a major increase of 36.6% over the allocation of &euro;61.1m for 2005.  This increase will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to further intensify its crime detection and investigation capabilities.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the technology required to assist in the fight against crime is available to them.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na constantly evaluate all available technology with a view to determining the technology best suited to their needs.  Significant resources are being invested in technology for the Garda&iacute; to assist them in the exercise of all their functions.  The capital allocation for IT in 2006 is &euro;33.323 million.  The allocation for communications is &euro;12.9 million.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region on 17 May, 2005.  This is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting this criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The operation remains in place and on-going in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and has been extended nationwide in 2006.</P>
        <P>Outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region, a series of special operations, prepared by senior Garda managers and designed to focus on areas and incidents of high crime, are also in place.  Operation Anvil has been proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs and families and has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the collation of intelligence on the movements of criminals being targeted under special initiatives arising from Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Garda Commissioner, in November 2005, augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda&iacute; to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Operations carried out by the unit have resulted in firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.  In terms of the Government&rsquo;s legislative response, it is widely acknowledged that our legislative package for tackling serious and organised crime is already one of the toughest in Europe.  The recently introduced Criminal Justice Act provides a comprehensive package of further anti-crime measures which will help enhance the powers of the Garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of offences.  Finally, I can assure the House that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling serious crime under continuing review, and to this end I will continue to ensure that every necessary resource is made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>The motivation of most criminals and their organisations is to profit from their illicit activities.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that serious and organised criminal groups employ money-laundering techniques to facilitate the re-introduction of the proceeds of their criminal activity into circulation.  As investigations into money laundering operations are often intrinsically linked with investigations into other aspects of organised crime, it is not possible to definitively state the number of operations or outlets that have been identified. </P>
        <P>I am further informed that investigations carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau, which now has officers in every Garda Division, monitor criminal activity which generates proceeds from crime, financial or otherwise, and may have attendant money laundering schemes.</P>
        <P>I am assured that senior Garda management closely monitor and regularly review the allocation of personnel to ensure that resources are deployed in the most efficient manner possible.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Courts Service is responsible for the day to day management of the courts and I am responsible for ensuring that the Service is adequately funded.  The Estimates for 2006 include &euro;19.6m to enable the Service to continue its ambitious nationwide programme of Courthouse renovation and refurbishment.

        <P>Since 2002, the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the Supreme, High, Circuit and District Courts has increased from 108 to 128, an increase of 20 judicial positions.

In addition, this year&rsquo;s estimates include &euro;9.4m to support major IT modernisation initiatives such as the Civil Case Management System, the delivery of court services by electronic means and courtroom technology upgrades.  I am confident that the level of funding provided to the Courts Service is adequate to maintain existing levels of service.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the statutory independence of the Courts Service, the Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the Service to decide how the funding provided is specifically allocated.

	<P>Since 2002, the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the Supreme, High, Circuit and District Courts has increased from 108 to 128, an increase of 20 judicial positions.  The additional judicial resources provided have greatly strengthened the capacity of the courts system to meet the demands placed on it and I am keeping the need for further judicial resources under review.   </P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 260 together.  </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the closure of the Curragh and Fort Mitchel was as a result of a Government decision in November, 2003 approving a series of measures to be taken on a rolling basis with effect from 1 January, 2004 in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association on a change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Irish Prison Service.  I made it quite clear at that time that the Irish Prison Service could not continue to spend public money to feed a chronic overtime culture while sustaining outdated and inefficient work practices.</P>
        <P>These closures coincided with the opening of a new wing in Limerick Prison and an unused wing in the Midlands Prison.  The opening of these spaces was facilitated by transfer of staff from the Curragh and Fort Mitchel and the new spaces compensated for the closures of the Curragh and Fort Mitchel.  I can also advise that construction of new prison spaces is underway at Portlaoise Prison, Castlerea Prison, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey and an additional 25 new spaces are already available at Loughan House.  The Deputy will also be aware of my plans for new prison complexes in North Dublin and Munster.</P>
        <P>The total number of prisoners in custody on 28 September, 2006 was 3,158 compared to a bed capacity of 3,383.  There is consequently no need for the widespread use of early release simply to ease overcrowding levels.  This is in stark contrast to the situation which prevailed in the mid-1990&rsquo;s where the scandal of the &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; was at its height.</P>

	<P>I am aware of reports which suggest that prisoners are running criminal syndicates from inside prison cells.  I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to implementing all appropriate measures to prevent the possibility of such activity and to ensure that the contact that prisoners have with the outside world is tightly controlled and monitored.</P>
        <P>Prisoner visits in all closed prisons are carefully controlled and held in sight of prison officers.  In addition, new Visiting Card arrangements are in place in almost all closed prisons whereby only persons who have been pre-approved by the Governor are permitted to visit.  Telephone calls in closed prisons are monitored by prison officers and incoming and outgoing mail is subject to examination by a prison censor.  In addition, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues and I can advise the Deputy that Garda&iacute; will be contacted whenever any suspected criminal offence has taken place.</P>
        <P>One of the major challenges in prisons today lies in preventing access to contraband items, primarily mobile phones and drugs, which for obvious reasons, are viewed as highly valuable commodities which could assist in illegal activity from the prisoner cells. Efforts are made on a continuous basis to prevent the flow of such contraband into our prisons, by for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, upgraded CCTV monitoring, the use of screened visits and the use of daily prisoner and cell searches.  In addition, the Prison Service are currently examining technological options for dealing with the use of mobile phones within prisons.</P><Col N="1452"/>
        <P>Random searches of cells and their occupants and searching of correspondence and other items have all intercepted significant quantities of contraband in recent years.  When a person is admitted to prison custody, he or she is searched and prohibited items and money are taken.  Similarly, searching takes place of prisoners returning from court, temporary release or visits.  Searches of prisoners also take place where their behaviour or information received raises suspicions that they may be in possession of contraband.  The new prison estates at Thornton Hall and Spike Island will also make it harder for contraband to enter the prison over the perimeter walls by means of locating recreation yards away from perimeter walls.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This represents an increase of 29 (or 12%) in the number of Garda personnel assigned to Garda stations in County Kildare during that period.</P>
        <P>Garda Divisional boundaries do not always correlate with County boundaries.  Garda stations in County Kildare form part of the Carlow/ Kildare Division.  However, not all Garda stations within the boundary of County Kildare form part of this Division, for instance Leixlip Garda station forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region.</P>
        <P>In addition, I would point out to the Deputy that the Garda resources for the Carlow/Kildare Division are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully <Col N="1454"/>on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of County Kildare will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>With the huge increase in investment in Garda resources under this Government, I am satisfied that Garda strength and technology is adequate to meet the challenges of modern society.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) during that period.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>In particular, the 2006 overtime allocation has risen to &euro;83.5m which represents an increase of 36.6% over the allocation of &euro;61.1m for 2005.  This substantial increase in the overtime budget reflects in particular the continued implementation of Operation Anvil.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s general budgetary policy is aimed at securing increased efficiencies in the deployment of Garda resources and the increase in the overtime allocation assists with that.</P>
        <P>I want to see Garda&iacute; provided with all necessary equipment up to best international practice.  I am providing and will continue to provide the necessary resources for this to happen.  In relation to protective equipment generally, I am of the view that in facing the dangers that they do on our streets, members of the Force need protective and defensive equipment commensurate with that risk.  In that regard, I wish to inform the Deputy that in relation to &ldquo;Body Armour&rdquo;, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has issued Requests for Tender (RFTs) <Col N="1455"/>for the supply and delivery of  12,500 Anti Stab/Ballistic Vests and 3,000 Retractable Batons.  There is also a provision in these RFTs to purchase a further 4,700 vests and a further 12,000 Batons, if required, over the duration of the contract.  Contracts are due to be signed in the very near future for the supply of these items and it is expected that the delivery will commence shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na constantly evaluate all available technology with a view to determining the technology best suited to their needs.  Significant resources are being invested in technology for the Garda&iacute; to assist them in the exercise of all their functions.  The capital allocation for IT in 2006 is &euro;33.323 million representing an increase of &euro;5.065 million (18%) on the 2005 outturn.  One aspect of technology I am particularly committed to is the delivery of a state-of-the-art digital radio service for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To this end, the procurement of an outsourced Managed Service by the Department of Finance on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other blue light services and some non-commercial public bodies, is well underway.  While the exact timeframe for rollout will be subject to contract negotiations with the successful bidder, the implementation of the new service is planned to commence later this year.  The total allocation for communications for 2006 is &euro;12.9 million.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  I have made the necessary regulations providing for the establishment of a Garda Reserve and recruitment and training of Reserve Members is underway.</P>
        <P>I am continuing to strengthen the civilian support available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Human Resources Division for civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has now been established and when fully operational will have a staffing complement of 37 civilians who will carry out recruitment, training, discipline, industrial relations and general HR administrative functions for the 1,900 clerical, administrative, professional, technical and industrial civilians now working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Division will also play a key strategic role in driving forward the wider Civilianisation Programme.  The Director and a number of staff have now com<Col N="1456"/>menced duty, and recruitment of the remaining staff is underway.  In addition, the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) in Castlebar, is now almost fully operational with some 150 civilian staff.  The GISC allows Garda&iacute; who would otherwise have to return to their Stations to input data on the PULSE system, to log the information with the GISC, while remaining on the beat.  This frees up very significant amounts of Garda time for continued operational duty.  This unprecedented investment in resources by this Government to An Garda S&iacute;ochana, provides a firm platform to take on the challenges of policing in a modern diverse society.</P>

	<P>The precise information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  The compilation of these statistics would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to prepare and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>
        <P>Typically the temporary releases would be of short duration when the prisoner is close to completion of sentence.  From time to time, consideration may be given to a somewhat longer period of release for the purposes of residential addiction counselling or for other constructive programmes, for example work training.  In these cases, the aim is to reduce the risk of reoffending.  Temporary release, which is always conditional on the prisoner&rsquo;s good behaviour, is recognised as being a useful instrument in preparing a prisoner for reintegration with society.</P>
        <P>As a result of the additional prison spaces provided over the last number of years, the Prison Service is now in a position to accommodate almost all those sentenced by the Courts for the full duration of their sentences.  The overall percentage of sentenced prisoners on temporary release has been reduced from a figure of 20% in December, 1996 to a current figure of about 4.7% of the total prison population.  To illustrate the scale of the problem, I can inform the House that the actual number of prisoners on temporary release on 9 December, 1996 stood at 552, compared with a current figure of 156 persons.</P>
        <P>Prisoners are not granted early release as a matter of course and I must stress that the overriding concern in considering applications for temporary release from prisoners is the safety of the public.  It is also important to note that all releases are subject to conditions, which in the <Col N="1457"/>vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to his/her local Garda station, and that any offender who breaks these conditions may be arrested and returned immediately to prison by the Garda&iacute;.</P>

Specifically in relation to combating drug crime, I may add that the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 specifies a number of supply reduction targets for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of all drug seizures and the Garda&iacute; continue to achieve considerable successes in relation to these targets. </P>
        <P>National Units, such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation all have specific roles in reducing drug supply and the material benefits which accrue from drug trafficking.  All of these units operate under the direction of an Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.  These strategies continue to result in operational successes as evidenced by the ongoing levels of drugs seized by the Garda&iacute;.  The trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs at local, national and international levels is constantly monitored by the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Local divisional drug units operate in divisions throughout the country with their primary focus being local dealers and users.  Garda National Drugs Unit personnel provide assistance and expertise to these local units in operational, intelligence and training matters.  The Garda National Drugs Unit, in conjunction with other Garda units, continues to undertake &ldquo;targeted specific&rdquo; operations against the larger illegal drug importation and distribution operations.</P>
        <P>Regarding resources, the Garda National Drug Unit works closely with Divisional and District Drug Units in detecting and preventing the sale and supply of illegal drugs.  Where necessary, these resources can be supplemented by Garda personnel operating at local level.  The needs of drug units are and will be kept under ongoing review, including in the context of distributing the additional resources being made available arising from the Government&rsquo;s decision to increase the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s top policing priority for 2006 is to continue to target organised crime, including drug trafficking.  The trafficking and dis<Col N="1458"/>tribution of all illicit drugs, at local, national and international levels will continue to be vigilantly monitored by the Garda&iacute;.  I am determined to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is appropriately resourced to advance its objectives in this regard.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that legislation providing for the issue of fixed charge notices requires that motorists detected for committing certain offences be issued with a fixed charge notice.  The notice sets out the amount of the fixed charge and the penalty points applicable to the offence.  The person has the option to pay the fixed charge and, as part of the payment process, completes a declaration that he or she is aware of the contents of the notice.  The decision whether to pay a fixed charge rests with the recipient.  The legislation also provides that in the event that the individual fails to pay the fixed charge within the prescribed time frame a prosecution can be initiated.  Once a prosecution is initiated it is then a matter for the court to determine the guilt or otherwise of the person based on the evidence presented.  As in all cases the decision of the District Court may be appealed.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that the Bye-Laws enacted by Wicklow County Council for the Newtownmountkennedy area have been in order at all times and no further action is required in respect of cases where a fixed charge payment was made for exceeding the relevant speed limits.  I am also informed that following a decision at Bray District Court on 16 June 2006 an application to bring a case stated has been made.</P>

	<P>I understand that the person concerned applied for the tax concessions under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme and that the application has been unsuccessful at first instance and on appeal to the Medical Board of Appeal for the Scheme. </P>
        <P>I have no direct responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the Medical Board of Appeal for the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme. Queries regarding individual cases may be addressed to the Secretary of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, c/o the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dun Laoghaire, County Dublin or alternatively by telephone at 01 2355279.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which determines appeals from a refusal of a Primary Medical Certificate under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme, is independent in the execution of its functions.</P>
        <P>In relation to extending the scope of the Scheme, the operation of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme was reviewed by a special Interdepartmental Review Group.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Group&rsquo;s Report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the possible future development of the scheme. The short-term recommendations in respect of the appeals process have been implemented.  The main change arising from these was that an increased number of members could be appointed to the Appeal Board, which facilitated a far greater number of appeal hearings than had been the case prior to the Report&rsquo;s publication.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context <Col N="1463"/>of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</P>

	<P>I presume that the Deputy&rsquo;s question arises from the EU&rsquo;s proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information on the <Col N="1464"/>payer accompanying transfers of funds.  This proposal has not yet been adopted by the European institutions, but when it is, it will have direct application in all Member States.  It is likely to come into effect in January 2007 at the earliest.</P>
        <P>The proposed Regulation is considered to be essential to detecting terrorist financing, money laundering and other criminal activity.  The Regulation would require international money transfers to be accompanied by the identity of the sender including the name, address and account number.  A less detailed regime is required within the EU.  The objective is to have this information available to law enforcement authorities and hence assist them in detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorists and other criminals and tracing their assets.  This proposal is part of the EU Plan of Action to Combat Terrorism.  My Department will issue further information when this Regulation comes into effect.</P>
        <P>In anticipation of the implementation of the Regulation, I understand that banks have already informed their customers of the new requirements and of the necessity to include details of their International Bank Account Number (IBAN) the associated Bank Identifier Code (BIC) when transferring funds.  Banks are obliged to state their customer&rsquo;s IBAN and BIC on their account statements since 1 July 2003.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> his proposals to reduce the incidence of tax avoidance in view of more than 25 of the highest earners having had no tax liability; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30803/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already acted in a systematic, detailed and radical manner to deal with the issue of inequitable use of tax incentives and allowances by a proportion of higher earners.  I would refer the Deputy to Budget and Finance Act 2006.  In these, I announced and introduced significant changes which mean that the potential for individuals to reduce their net liability for tax by using tax reliefs will be curtailed.</P>
        <P>In particular, a restriction has been placed on the use of specified tax reliefs by high income tax payers.  The restriction will come into effect from 1 January 2007.  The list of specified reliefs includes various property based tax incentives and certain other reliefs such as the Business Expansion Scheme, film relief and donations.  Also to be restricted are certain tax exemptions including artistic income, stallion fees, and patent royalties.</P>
        <P>However, it should be pointed out that individuals will still be fully entitled to claim for normal business expenses and deductions for capital allowances on plant and machinery, genuine business related trading losses and losses from a rental business without restriction.  In addition, they may also continue to claim without restriction the normal deductible items such as medical expenses, trade union subscriptions, the personal tax credits and exemptions such as that for child benefit.</P><Col N="1466"/>
        <P>Moreover, following on fundamental reviews which I have had carried out of around two dozen specific tax incentives, I have already provided that a range of existing property based tax schemes are to be phased out, subject to transitional measures the effect of which will be that no relief will be available for expenditure arising after end-July 2008.  I have left in place some incentives which are justified having regard to benefits they can provide.</P>
        <P>I should say that in any event, it is not clear where the Deputy has sourced the statistic that more than 25 of the highest earners have no tax liability.  The latest figures available in relation to the tax year 2003, as included with my reply to Parliamentary Question Reference No. 29483/06 on 27 September, indicate that nobody in the PAYE sector with gross income of &euro;500,000 or over had a nil net liability for income tax.  However, 19 self employed individuals with gross income of &euro;500,000 had a nil net liability for income tax.  Persons in the self-employed category may include a broad range of individuals, for example shop owners, tradespersons and farmers as well as those in pursuit of various professions such as dentists, doctors, solicitors etc.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, however, that there are many reasons why a self employed person may have a nil net liability for tax.</P>
        <P>Gross income is income before adjustments are made for items such as capital allowances, interest paid, losses and allowable expenses, including normal business expenses and depreciation on plant and machinery.  For example, capital equipment purchased by a dentist in establishing a practice or farm machinery, such as a tractor, purchased by a farmer are allowable as deductions against gross income at a rate of 12.5% of the capital cost per annum for eight years.  Gross income must be distinguished <Col N="1467"/>from taxable income which is income after adjustments for deductions of the type described, including normal business expenses.</P>

        <Quest> the changes made in the claiming of special tuition charges for dyslexic children by way of a medical expense against income tax liability; the reason these changes were made; the reason parents can no longer claim tax relief on these tuition charges for dyslexic children in view of the fact that this was allowed previously; if there is a way that these costs can be treated as a legitimate medical expenses eligible for tax relief; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that expenses in respect of tuition for children with dyslexia do not qualify for health expenses tax relief and have never qualified for the relief since it was first introduced in 1967.  </P>
        <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners, who deal with such claims, that individuals may have been under the impression that tuition for children with dyslexia was allowable under the heading of health expenses relief.  I also understand that the Revenue Commissioners have written to the Dyslexia Association to clarify the matter.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to extend the relief but the matter, like any other, can be raised by the Deputy at Finance Bill time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 and 288 together.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance, in common with all other civil service Departments and Offices, fully implements the Government&rsquo;s policy on the employment of people with a disability.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that, as part of a review of policy on the employment of people with a disability in the civil service, my Department commissioned independent research in relation to the operation of the 3% employment target.  A survey carried out as part of this research  which was published as &ldquo;Employment and Career Progression of people with a disability in the Irish Civil Service,&rdquo; shows that 7% of Civil Service staff have a disability compared with the 2 to 3% generally reported in the annual surveys.  The consultants therefore concluded that the arrangements in relation to reporting disabilities needed to be addressed.</P>
        <P>In the light of the consultants&rsquo; recommendations, the Government approved proposals to improve the operation of the existing policy.  These included [a] the development, in conjunction with the staff unions, of a new code of practice for all Departments to support staff with a disability and [b] ensuring that the civil service continues to provide employment opportunities which might not otherwise exist for people with a disability.</P>
        <P>A number of significant initiatives have been taken recently.  The Department of Finance has recruited a Disability Advisory Officer to develop guidelines in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer for the monitoring, reporting and recording arrangements for staff with a disability in the Civil Service.  My Department is working with the National Disability Authority to explore potential new approaches to supporting staff with disabilities, including the possible use of a survey based on voluntary self-disclosure, both for new staff on appointment and for existing staff.  A Disability Liaison Officers network involving all Departments has also been set up to share information and advice.  It is also important that the Civil Service continues to offer employment opportunities to people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>In relation to recruitment, a new approach to the recruitment and placement of people with a disability into the Civil Service is being adopted, which will include special competitions or sub-panels being held from time to time with the aim of ensuring that 3% of all recruits to the Civil Service are people with a disability.  Recruitment <Col N="1469"/>competitions run by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) are open to all, including people with disabilities, subject to their meeting the eligibility requirements of the competition in question.  Application forms invite applicants to indicate if they have special requirements when undergoing the selection process and the PAS makes every effort to facilitate these requests.</P>
        <P>In relation to employment in the Department of Finance, my Department is participating in the WAM (Willing Able Mentoring) Project, which is a work experience placement and administered by the Association of Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) which aims to place graduates with disabilities with employers in the public and private sectors.</P>

        <Quest> the plans she has for legislation requiring all retail outlets for meat products to clearly label their products with country of origin of the products in the interests of traceability and public health; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>EU food labelling legislation is harmonised by Council Directive 2000/13/EC, as amended.  That directive, as amended, has been transposed into national legislation by the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2002 to 2005.  These regulations apply to the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer, or for supply to mass caterers, and are based on the principle that food labelling should not mislead consumers.  </P>
        <P>Labelling rules are designed to inform consumers so that they can make informed choices.  Currently, origin labelling is not required for pre-packaged food unless its absence misleads the consumer.  Thus, for example, where other particulars such as a flag or a map other than that of the country of origin are displayed on a label, the true country of origin must be clearly declared to ensure that the consumer is not misled as to the true origin or provenance of the food.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is currently reviewing the horizontal labelling legislation in order to recast and modernise its provisions.  My Department has responded to this consultation, suggesting, inter alia, that consideration should be given to the extension of food labelling legislation to provide for a clear indication of the country of origin for all meat and of products made substantially from meat.  A legislative proposal from the Commission is awaited and the Deputy will appreciate that as food labelling legislation is harmonised across the Member States, Ireland cannot pre-empt the outcome of the Commission&rsquo;s ongoing review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The seven year Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000-2006, which is implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children, has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of childcare facilities to address the needs of parents, in reconciling their childcare needs with their participation in employment, education and training.  </P>
        <P>With regard to specific provision under the EOCP for school age childcare, to date 191 capital and staffing grants which included after school childcare have been approved, to a total value of some &euro;18.5 million. It is anticipated that, when fully drawn down, these grants will lead to the creation of 2,170 new childcare places and support or enhance 2,286 existing places.</P>

	<P>The Prevention and Early Intervention Programme for Children was established by Government  to support and promote better outcomes for children in disadvantaged areas, through more innovation, effective planning, integration and delivery of services.  The purpose of the programme is to support the development of plans for children at local level drawn up by the statutory and relevant non-statutory agencies operating in the areas concerned.  The Programme will provide for the introduction and evaluation of a range of integrated interventions for children and their <Col N="1473"/>families and test if they make a positive difference to children.  The focus of the programme is on supporting proposals for interventions, which fit with national policy objectives, have been developed in conjunction with the local community, are based on clear evidence of local need and which are informed by evidence of &lsquo;what works&rsquo;.  Learning and evaluation are important components of the programme and individual services, area projects and the overall programme will be subject to ongoing and robust review and evaluation.  The programme will run for an initial three-year period and will have a fund amounting to &euro;36 million in total, half of which will be provided by Government and half by The Atlantic Philanthropies.</P>
        <P>The Government agreed that the best use of this funding was to focus initially on a small number of projects in severely disadvantaged communities.  Three areas are being targeted during this period, subject to assessment of plans submitted.  These have been identified as areas of severe disadvantage with a strong community commitment to improving outcomes for children.  Research and planning on prevention and early intervention measures sponsored by Atlantic Philanthropies, has been undertaken over the last two years in these areas and they are now in an excellent position to test new models of service delivery.  If these models prove successful, the results of these projects may provide the basis for enhanced resource allocation processes and policy changes.</P>
        <P>My Office recently invited three projects to submit the details of their projects for consideration for funding under the Programme, one of which was the Childhood Development Initiative in Tallaght West.  These project proposals are currently being examined and my officials will be meeting with the projects in the next week to discuss the submissions.  The plans will then be assessed by an International Expert Panel against criteria agreed between Government and Atlantic Philanthropies.  The allocation of the funding will follow this extensive evaluation.  Assuming the applications are successful, it is expected that some funding will be drawn down before year end.</P>

	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.  The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility.</P>
        <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process the Health Service Executive can take into account a range of measures including the household income guidelines, particular circumstances and the medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  In addition people over the age of 70 years have an automatic entitlement to a medical card regardless of income.  Application should be made to the local area office of the HSE.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, I introduced a new graduated benefit &mdash; the GP Visit Card to extend free GP care and treatment to individuals and families on moderate incomes.</P>
        <P>In June last year, I simplified the means test for both medical and GP visit cards.  It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  In 2005 the income guidelines for medical cards were increased by a cumulative 29 per cent.  The income assessment guidelines used for the GP visit card are 50% higher than those used for medical cards.  These improvements have made the assessment process much fairer and ensure that those on low to moderate incomes can qualify for free GP care.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month, or approximately  &euro;20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly <Col N="1477"/>reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>

	<P>I have met with representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of my wish to have a quality assured programme rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  For this to happen, essential elements of the roll out must be in place including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes.  I have made additional revenue funding of &euro;2.3m available to BreastCheck to meet the additional costs of roll out.  I have also approved an additional 69 posts.  BreastCheck recently appointed Clinical Directors for the Southern and Western regions and the recruitment of Consultants and other staff is now underway.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck also requires considerable capital investment in the construction of two new clinical units and in the provision of  five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  I have made available an additional &euro;21m capital funding to BreastCheck for this purpose.  Demolition works at South Infirmary/Victoria University Hospital were completed last month.  The Department has issued approval to BreastCheck to award contracts for the construction of the static units at the South Infirmary/Victoria University Hospital, Cork and University College Hospital Galway.  BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of roll out to the Southern and Western regions will be met.</P>

	<P>In considering the Report of the Task Force, complex legal and financial issues emerged in relation to aspects of the proposed scheme and their implications for the health service and the wider public service.  As a result the Government decided in July 2005 not to introduce a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme for psychiatric nurses as outlined in the Task Force Report.  I confirmed this position to the nurses&rsquo; representatives at a meeting in July 2005.</P>
        <P>However, following the Government decision it was decided to request the State Claims Agency (SCA) to examine the possibility of establishing a fixed redress fund for psychiatric nurses physically injured as a result of an assault by a patient.</P>
        <P>Consultations between my Department, the Department of Finance, the SCA and the Health Service Executive &mdash; Employers Agency have been ongoing.

	<P>The provision of private care in public acute hospitals is long standing feature of the Irish <Col N="1484"/>health care system.  Some 2,500 beds in public hospitals are designated as private and semi-private.  The 80:20 ratio to which the Deputy refers is an average across the entire acute system.  The percentage of beds designated as private varies between individual hospitals; for example, there is a higher ratio of private beds in maternity and paediatric hospitals and a lower ratio in other hospitals.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that there are instances where the ratio of private work has far exceeded the stated bed designation.  This is a matter which is central to this Government&rsquo;s reform programme, in particular, in relation to a new hospital consultants&rsquo; contract.</P>

	<P>There is no ban on recruitment of staff in the public health service.

I have also emphasised the need to achieve an appropriate balance between clinical and non-clinical posts.</P>
        <P>Approved employment levels for the health service have been adjusted since 2002 in line with Government policy on public sector employment and also to take account of specific policy measures aimed at increasing service levels.

	<P>Tackling the problems in A&amp;E departments is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A&amp;E and do not require admission.</P>
        <P>A &amp; E services are improving around the country.  Compared to this time last year, the average number of patients in A &amp; E departments awaiting admission is down by approximately 40%.  The average time that patients spend waiting for admission has also been reduced.</P>
        <P>The HSE established a dedicated Task Force to work with hospitals to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services in A&amp;E departments.  Teams from the Task Force undertook site visits to each of the hospitals identified as experiencing consistent difficulties in A&amp;E services to discuss individual issues and potential high impact solutions.  The Task Force&rsquo;s conclusions and recommendations will inform the HSE&rsquo;s actions in relation to A&amp;E over the coming months.</P>
        <P>A &amp; E departments are not standalone services; they are a critical part of a complex healthcare system.  Their ability to function efficiently and effectively is heavily dependent on well-functioning practices and processes within the entire acute hospital system, and the availability of integrated primary and community services.</P>
        <P>In order that A &amp; E targets and objectives can be achieved over the clinical winter months, the HSE is introducing a broad-based Winter Initiative to build on its existing range of initiatives.</P>
        <P>The Winter Initiative will be similar to those in place in other health systems internationally.  Its <Col N="1487"/>purpose is to ensure that the services required to address the particular demands of the winter season are in place and operating optimally.  It will focus on a range of measures, including preventative measures, public communications, discharge initiatives, continuing care and home supports.  Tackling the issue of care for older people is an important and integral part of the Initiative.  The HSE is implementing a number of measures aimed at achieving increases in extended care provision.</P>
        <P>I believe that the actions and initiatives being taken by the HSE will result in the sustained improvements in A &amp; E services that patients and their families deserve.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 has a significant impact on the plans for the implementation of Part 2 of the Disability Act.  The arrangements for the implementation of one Act cannot be considered in isolation from the arrangements for the other, as the same health service staff, mainly in the areas of disability and mental health services, will be called upon to provide assessments and services under both Acts.  Close collaboration and cross-sectoral working will continue at local and national level, involving the Health Service Executive (HSE), National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and both Departments concerned.</P>
        <P>Following consultation between my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education &amp; Science, the NCSE and other stakeholders, it has been agreed that, in the phasing arrangements for the implementation of Part 2, priority will be given to the needs of young children as follows:</P>
        <P>Part 2 will commence for children aged under 5 years old with effect from 1st June 2007.</P>
        <P>Part 2 will be commenced in respect of children aged 5-18 in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act.</P>
        <P>In preparation for its implementation, health related support services for children aged 5 to 18 will continue to be enhanced to enable the HSE to meet needs identified for this group.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent regulator. </P>
        <P>However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband.  My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities.  These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward <Col N="1490"/>investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.</P>
        <P>Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity.  The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector.</P>
        <P>For rural communities and the hinterlands of larger towns, my Department offers funding under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) to enable them to become self-sufficient in broadband, in association with service providers.  The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable b broadband delivery platform for the area.  To date, over 160 projects have been approved for funding under this Programme.</P>
        <P>A joint industry/Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the Broadband for Schools Programme to resource the provision of high speed broadband connectivity to all primary and post primary schools in the country by end Autumn 2006, at no cost to the schools themselves.  95% of schools have broadband installed to date; the aim is to complete the outstanding schools in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>However, there are some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  I am currently examining options to address the delivery of broadband services to these areas and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly.</P>

	<P>Under the Voisinage Agreement the mussel seed fishery in Ireland is managed on an all-island basis.  On advice from a joint advisory committee, I authorise mussel dredging by Irish Registered Fishing vessels in Irish waters and waters around Northern Ireland for the purpose of ongrowing on aquaculture sites.</P>
        <P>The joint advisory committee, comprising representatives from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR), Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), Depart<Col N="1491"/>ment of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in Northern Ireland and the Loughs Agency, assesses applications for allocations of Mussel seed and advises the Department and DARD in Northern Ireland accordingly.  The advisory committee&rsquo;s recommendations for allocations are based on factors such as the operator&rsquo;s track record and production levels of bottom mussels.  Allocations are made in respect of an authorised vessel and specified aquaculture sites.  The purpose of dredging for mussel seed in Lough Swilly, or in any other waters, is specifically for relaying the seed to the operators&rsquo; own licensed aquaculture sites.  The proposed allocations are submitted to the Department for my approval prior to the issuing of authorisations to fish for mussel seed.</P>
        <P>In line with the requirements of EU regulations, under Irish legislation, measures are in place, which provide for the control of movements of shellfish from bays around the coast.  Following the detection of bonamia ostrea in Lough Foyle last year, specific controls were put in place on movements of shellfish from the lough by SI 500 of 2005.  In addition, a comprehensive range of guidelines, drawn up by this Department working with the Department of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development, Northern Ireland, the Marine Institute and the Loughs Agency, has been put in place in respect of shellfish operations in Lough Foyle.  A copy of the guidelines was circulated to all operators on the 28th of July 2005 to help prevent the spread of the parasite.  Operators have been strongly advised to adhere to these guidelines.</P>
        <P>Based on the framework outlined above, applications made to this Department to move shellfish originating in Lough Foyle for ongrowing in areas free of bonamia, would be refused.  A movement licence was issued by the Department to move 850 tonnes of mussel seed from Lough Swilly, which is free of bonamia ostrea, to Lough Foyle in February 2006.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the proposal made at the EU summit <Col N="1496"/>on 24 March 2006 to consider raising the target for share of renewable energies to 15% by 2015 and the share of biofuels to 8%; and his views on whether these would constitute a viable target for Ireland. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30796/06]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently announced an ambitious programme to almost treble the contribution from renewable energy sources from 5.2% of gross electricity consumption in Ireland in 2004 to 15% by 2010, some five years in advance of the target discussed at the Spring Council meeting.  This is a challenging but viable target.  We have gone further again in stating in the Green Paper on Energy Policy published on 1 October our commitment to an ambitious target of 30% by 2020. </P>
        <P>With regard to biofuels, Ireland, like many other EU Member States, is developing its biofuels sector from a low base.  This is borne out by the fact that Member States combined reported a target of 1.4% for 2005, which is below the Directive&rsquo;s indicative target.  The Commission has accepted Ireland&rsquo;s target of 2% by 2008.  The new excise relief programme is being rolled out from this year to 2010 and will enable us to reach the initial target of 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper on Energy proposes a further target of 5.75% for biofuels market penetration by 2010.  To achieve this target, a significant change in land use patterns or a level of imports may be required.  The Ministerial Task Force on Bio-energy Strategy is addressing the most appropriate measures required to achieve this target and this will inform decisions on future targets including the viability of a target of 8% market penetration of biofuels by 2015.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354, 357, 364 and 367 together.</P>
        <P>The situation in the Middle East, especially in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, remains at the top of the foreign policy agendas of Ireland nationally and of the European Union.  The conflict in Lebanon this summer and the continuing crisis in Gaza and the West Bank, serve to underline that there is no military or unilateral solution to the inter-related problems of the region.  It is the strong view of the Government, and of our partners in the EU, that the underlying cause of the recurring crises in the region is the absence of a credible process for a comprehensive settlement.  I stated in my address to the UN General Assembly on 26 September that a comprehensive settlement is more urgently required now than at any time in the past 60 years.  The most recent meeting of the General Affairs and External <Col N="1498"/>Relations Council, which I attended in Brussels on 15 September, stated clearly the position of the EU that lasting peace and security in the region can only be ensured by a comprehensive settlement, with a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli &ndash; Palestinian conflict at its core.</P>
        <P>The terrible violence and suffering in Lebanon this summer was both tragic and unnecessary.  The immediate cause of the conflict was an unprovoked attack by Hezbollah on Israeli territory, and the killing and capture of a number of Israeli soldiers.  From the beginning, the Government called unambiguously for an immediate cessation of violence and the protection of civilian lives.  I fully acknowledged that Israel had a right to defend itself against the attacks, but not at the expense of the rights and the lives of Lebanese civilians.  We were shocked at the harsh and disproportionate military response by Israel, at the very high civilian casualties and at the widespread destruction of vital civilian infrastructure.  The UN Secretary General has quoted official Lebanese figures showing that 1,187 people died and 4,092 were injured in the country as a result of the conflict.  The UN estimates that 1 million Lebanese people were displaced from their homes, the vast majority of whom have now returned.  The conflict also resulted in the deaths of 43 Israeli civilians and 117 soldiers.  Some 300,000 people were displaced from their homes.</P>
        <P>The Government and our partners in the EU will remain actively engaged in support of the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701, which was adopted unanimously on 11 August.  It created the basis on which the fighting was brought to an end three days later and it offers a path to a stable peace, based on the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon.  The EU has taken the lead in ensuring that the deployment of a strengthened UNIFIL force in Southern Lebanon, alongside units of the Lebanese Army, has proceeded smoothly, and that the ceasefire has held.  The mission will be strengthened further over the coming weeks, and I indicated at the UN last week that the Government expected to be in a position to decide on an Irish contribution to UNIFIL II, subject to D&aacute;il approval.</P>
        <P>The Government remains very seriously concerned about the deteriorating situation in the Occupied Territories.  The situation in Gaza in particular is unsustainable.  As I stated at the UN General Assembly, it is time for a major new international effort to launch serious negotiations for a settlement based on the essential elements of the Quartet Roadmap, with the clear objective of the establishment of two sovereign, viable and democratic States, living together in peace and security.</P>
        <P>We strongly support the efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to form a Palestinian Government of national unity, committed to the peace process and reflecting the principles set out by <Col N="1499"/>the EU and the Quartet following the elections in January.  I have stated consistently that if he is successful, I will argue very strongly for a generous and creative political response by the EU and the international community.  The EU is working closely with the Israeli Government and the Palestinians on the basis that both parties must demonstrate that they are ready to meet their obligations under the Roadmap and under international law.  We hope that there will be an early, substantive meeting to this end between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas.</P>
        <P>The immediate priority must be to end the humanitarian and security crisis in Gaza.  This must involve the release of the captured Israeli soldier and of imprisoned Palestinian legislators, the ending of violence from all sources and the reopening of crossing points for people and for goods.  The violence of recent days underlines the urgency of the situation, and the need for acts of political courage on all sides.  In addition, while the EU has this year increased the level of its assistance to the Palestinian people, it is essential that Israel resume transfers of the taxes and customs duties owed to the Palestinian Authority, which it is withholding.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>When they met on 6 April last in Armagh, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair set out the Governments&rsquo; joint strategy for achieving a fully functioning Assembly and Executive this year.  Since then, the Taoiseach and I have been engaged in intensive efforts, in conjunction with the British Government, to achieve restoration of the institutions by the 24 November deadline.  This has involved regular and ongoing contacts with the political parties, which have intensified in recent months.</P>
        <P>On 29 June I accompanied the Taoiseach to Stormont for a series of high level meetings between the Governments and the political parties to take stock of developments since the recall of the Assembly on 15 May.  To assist the parties in their preparations for Government we published a workplan and a timetable clearly setting out the steps to restoration of the institutions by 24 November.  We stressed that the key to success is engagement and agreement between the parties themselves and we urged them to make full use of the summer period and to engage seriously on resolving the issues necessary for restoration.</P>
        <P>It was encouraging to see engagement between the parties in the Preparation for Government <Col N="1500"/>Committee over the summer.  It was also encouraging that those meetings led to agreement on some of the issues which need to be addressed in the context of restoration.  We will seek to build on that work when we meet the parties for high-level talks in Scotland next week.  Those talks will be critical to the success of our efforts.  The Governments are approaching them with serious intent.  We hope all the parties will do likewise.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, we are intensifying contact with the parties.  I met with Mark Durkan and some of his colleagues in the SDLP in Derry on 14 September, and yesterday I met in Stormont with representatives of the UUP, Sinn F&eacute;in, Alliance and the PUP.  Contacts will continue over the coming days in advance of the talks in Scotland.  I am due to meet the Secretary of State tomorrow at Hillsborough to review the outcome of those meetings and to plan for the Scotland talks.</P>
        <P>I genuinely believe that with political will, agreement is possible between the parties by 24 November.  The Governments cannot make this happen &mdash; the best prospects of a sustainable deal will arise from all the parties working together in an inclusive process.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I personally will spare no effort in the weeks remaining to secure a deal.</P>

	<P>While there are no plans at present to open further passport offices, it is the policy to keep the operation of the passport service under on-going review.  As background, I should say that the majority of passports are now issued through the &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service which is operated jointly by my Department and An Post.  This service is available in over 1,000 post offices throughout the State.  Overall, more than 90% of all passports are processed within 10 working days.</P>
        <P>In response to the ever increasing demand for passports in recent years, as well as requirements for higher security standards, and a commitment to offer our citizens the most effective possible service, the passport issuing system has been going through a process of modernisation and upgrading.  A new Automated Passport System was introduced in late 2004, in the new Passport Production facility in Balbriggan, Co. Dublin, followed by the main Passport Office in Molesworth <Col N="1501"/>Street in January 2005.  The system was extended to the Cork and London Passport Offices in late 2005 and to all our Missions abroad during 2005 and 2006.  Our new passport booklet is one of the most secure in the world and has been widely admired.</P>
        <P>The Department is also working on developing online facilities to enable applicants to track the progress of their application over the internet.  This facility will be available imminently.  We are also introducing biometrics into passports later this month, in order to further improve passport security and comply with the latest international standards for secure travel documents.  It will also ensure that Irish citizens can continue to avail of visa free travel to the United States.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation to which the Deputy refers relates to the recent intensification of violence in the Catatumbo region of north-eastern Colombia located close to the western border of Venezuela.  This region has suffered greatly from violence throughout the period of internal strife in Colombia, compounded by resistance on the part of irregular armed groups to Government attempts to eradicate illegal coca cultivation.  The UNHCR has registered an estimated 2,000 internally displaced persons from the Catatumbo region since the beginning of 2006.</P>
        <P>Ireland, together with the EU, continues to monitor the humanitarian and human rights situation in Colombia.  Real progress towards an improvement in the humanitarian and human rights situation of all the people of Colombia is most likely to be made in the context of a settlement of the internal armed conflict, with efforts to bring about an end to civil strife currently being undertaken within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law.  In this regard, a recent EU Heads of Mission in Colombia report noted a positive trend of improvement in the human rights situation in Colombia, specifically in relation to the rights of internally displaced persons, with the reinforced application of the national legal framework resulting in a decrease in new displacements.</P>
        <P>Ireland undertook in June 2005 a commitment to contribute &euro;390,000 over a three year period to the Organization of American States&rsquo; (OAS) peace and verification mission in Colombia, the <Col N="1502"/>second tranche of which (&euro;130,000) is due to be released shortly.  The mission&rsquo;s mandate is to provide comprehensive support to the Colombian peace process, with a focus both on the demobilisation process and on the strengthening of institutions concerned with the rule of law.  I also attach the highest priority to the humanitarian and human rights dimension of the OAS mission&rsquo;s role.  With this in mind, an additional &euro;130,000 was given to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in December 2005 for the independent monitoring of human rights issues in support of the mission.</P>
        <P>The EU has confirmed its readiness and that of its Member States to assist the Colombian government and civil society in the provision of support for communities affected by the internal conflict.  It has also called on all parties to the conflict to respect human rights and international humanitarian law and commended the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) in Colombia.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident Embassies in Colombia.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has consistently made clear that it is gravely concerned about the continuing humanitarian and political crisis in Darfur and is using all avenues to urge concerted international action to resolve it.  We have been very active bilaterally, at EU level and in the UN context.  We will continue to use every opportunity to persuade the Government of Sudan to accept a UN force in Darfur.</P>
        <P>Darfur was top of the agenda in my meetings in New York last week with the Sudanese Foreign Minister and UN Secretary General Annan.  It was also a major topic in my address to the UN General Assembly on 26 September 2006.  Last July, I was the first EU Foreign Minister to visit Darfur since the signature of the May Peace Agreement, where I visited the largest displaced persons&rsquo; camp, at Abu Shouk, near El Fashir.</P>
        <P>The renewed fighting in areas of North Darfur is alarming.  The decision by the Sudan Government to seek a military solution and bring more troops to the region, coupled with fighting among armed groups, shows utter disregard for the May 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement.  It is clear from the killing and suffering of civilians during attacks <Col N="1503"/>on villages and internally displaced persons that combatants are not distinguishing between civilian and military targets.  As indicated by the UN Secretary General in his report of 26 September, Darfur is at a critical stage; insecurity in this troubled region is at its highest levels and humanitarian access at its lowest levels since 2004.  The Secretary General pointed out that, unless security improves, the world is facing the prospect of having to drastically curtail an acutely needed humanitarian operation.</P>
        <P>On 25 September, Mr. Jan Pronk, the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Sudan, wrote to the leaders of the Government of Sudan and all movements involved in military action in Darfur urging them to refrain from hostilities and resume dialogue during the Muslim month of Ramadan (24 September &ndash; 24 October), as a gesture of sincerity and goodwill towards civilians.</P>
        <P>On 15 September, EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs condemned the reported military attacks by both the Sudanese Government and the rebel groups and stressed that any military action will only further aggravate the already alarming humanitarian situation.  Ministers emphasised that the Sudanese Government should stop their military action in Darfur, abide by the ceasefire agreement and respect their commitments under the Darfur Peace Agreement.  Non-signatories should be held fully responsible for the fulfilment of their commitments set out in the April 2004 N&rsquo;djamena Ceasefire Agreement.  I call on all parties in the strongest terms to halt the violence and uphold their obligations to protect civilians.</P>
        <P>The reported bombing raids in North Darfur by the Sudanese Government are a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005), which demanded that the Government of Sudan should immediately cease conducting offensive military flights over the Darfur region, in accordance with its obligations under the N&rsquo;djamena Ceasefire Agreement and the November 2004 Abuja Security Protocol.  In its April 2006 report to the Security Council, the Panel of Experts established under Resolution 1591 (2005) recommended that the Council should consider establishment of an air exclusion zone (no fly zone) over the entire Darfur region for all Government of Sudan aircraft and aircraft utilised by parties to the conflict in Darfur.  The Council has not yet done so.  However, Resolution 1591 (2005) does provide that individuals responsible for offensive military overflights can be subjected to a travel ban or economic sanctions if the Council so decides.</P>
        <P>As I stated when I addressed the UN General Assembly last week, the suffering of the people of Darfur shames the world.  We cannot indefinitely stand by and watch with horror from the sidelines.  The Sudanese Government has a clear responsibility to protect its citizens and if it fails <Col N="1504"/>to act the international community will have to consider possible further measures.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, Kosovo has been under UN administration since the end of the conflict there in 1999, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.  The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has been working with the Provisional Institutions of Self Government to bring about the implementation of European Standards in areas such as minority rights and the rule of law.</P>
        <P>On 24 October 2005 the then Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General, Ambassador Kai Eide of Norway, presented to the UN Security Council a report of his comprehensive review of the situation in Kosovo.  Ambassador Eide was critical of many aspects of the situation in Kosovo.  He described the prospects for a multi-ethnic society as &ldquo;grim&rdquo; and was especially critical of the lack of progress in bringing about the rule of law.  Nevertheless he recommended that, while there would never be an ideal time to decide Kosovo&rsquo;s future status, the time had come to begin a political process to consider this.</P>
        <P>As recommended by Ambassador Eide, a process of consideration of the future status of Kosovo has been under way since last year, led by the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Envoy, former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.  Ireland and our EU partners fully support the work of Mr Ahtisaari and his team.</P>
        <P>Talks between Serbia, including representatives of the Kosovo Serb community, and representatives of the Kosovo Albanian community began in Vienna under the auspices of Mr.<?oasys _jy ?>Ahtisaari in February last.  They focused on such issues as decentralisation, seen as a confidence building measure for minorities, and protection of Serb religious and cultural sites.  Neither these talks nor parallel talks, focusing on the status issue and taking place over the summer, produced any significant measure of agreement.</P>
        <P>Mr Ahtisaari is now expected to bring forward proposals to the UN Security Council before the end of the year.  While the exact nature of the proposals remain to be seen, there is an expectation that he will recommend that Kosovo be granted independence, albeit with limitations upon it, and with a continuing major role for the international community.  Finally, it is broadly agreed that whatever arrangements emerge must offer guarantees for the protection of minorities, <Col N="1505"/>including their participation in public administration.</P>

	<P>The EU&rsquo;s restrictive measures against Zimbabwe were initially imposed in February 2002 and were renewed for a further twelve months in February 2006.  The restrictive measures involve a travel ban, assets freeze and arms embargo and are very much targeted at the leading members of the ZANU-PF government, and not at the people of Zimbabwe.  The EU has also suspended its development cooperation with Zimbabwe, although certain types of cooperation involving the provision of basic services are exempted, with a view to avoiding an adverse effect on the population.</P>
        <P>Within Zimbabwe itself, the overall political, economic and humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.  Inflation in Zimbabwe is now estimated to be 1200%, the highest in the world, while unemployment is estimated to be around 80%.  There continue to be severe food shortages in the country, with over one million people currently requiring sustained food assistance.  The dire political and economic conditions have led to large-scale immigration, with at least 2 million Zimbabweans now judged to be living illegally in South Africa.</P>
        <P>There is at yet no indication that the Zimbabwean government is willing to alter the policies which have brought about this situation or introduce those democratic and economic reforms long called for by the international community and which, if introduced, would positively influence EU-Zimbabwe relations.  On the contrary, we have seen increased repression, with large-scale arrests of peaceful demonstrators and credible reports of trade union leaders being seriously ill-treated in police detention last month.  There is also no evidence of serious efforts by the Zimbabwean government to re-house the many hundreds of thousands of people left homeless, following Operation Murambatsvina launched in May 2005.</P>
        <P>It is clear that international pressure needs to be maintained on the Mugabe government to alter its current policies.  Ireland and our EU partners are determined to continue working with others in the international community, including our partners in Africa who can exert particular influence, to help promote democratic change in Zimbabwe.  I discussed the current situation in Zimbabwe with the South African Foreign Minister in New York on 25 September and urged South Africa to continue its efforts to influence the situation positively.  EU Ambassadors in <Col N="1506"/>Zimbabwe, including Ireland&rsquo;s, are also maintaining contact with all those within Zimbabwean society who may be in a position to influence positive change.</P>
        <P>The Government is also continuing to make available humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe.  Since 2004 Ireland has committed over &euro;13 million in aid to Zimbabwe, including &euro;3.7 million this year to address emergency needs.  The largest proportion of this funding is for immediate humanitarian needs, particularly the provision of food assistance.  Ireland is also providing funding to mitigate the impact of the HIV/Aids pandemic in Zimbabwe which is estimated to infect 25% of the population.  Earlier this year Ireland approved a new programme of funding for HIV/Aids in Zimbabwe amounting to &euro;7.5m over the years 2006-2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about the situation in Thailand and am carefully monitoring developments there.  I had been aware of the political difficulties in that country and, indeed, had had an opportunity to discuss the situation there with the then Foreign Minister of Thailand, when he visited Ireland a few weeks ago, but the staging of a coup was unexpected.</P>
        <P>Ireland, along with our EU partners, supported a statement issued by the Finnish EU Presidency immediately after the coup which condemned the take-over of power from the democratic government of Thailand by the Thai military forces, demanded that the military forces stand back and give way to the democratically-elected political government and expressed the hope that Thailand will soon be able to return to democratic order.</P>
        <P>We were also party to a follow-up EU Statement delivered on 28 September reiterating the great importance that the EU attaches to Thailand&rsquo;s speedy return to democracy and constitutional order, legitimised by free and democratic elections to be held as soon as possible.  The statement went on to call for martial law to give way, without delay, to the rule of ordinary law with full respect for human rights and civil liberties.  Noting the military leadership&rsquo;s assurances that Thailand will continue to abide by the United Nations Charter and international treaties and agreements, the EU stated that the decisions and actions of the new military-appointed government will be evaluated by the EU in the light of Thailand&rsquo;s international obligations,<i> inter alia</i> in the area of human rights, including freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, as well as <Col N="1507"/>the military leadership&rsquo;s specific assurances to this respect as mentioned above.  It concluded by emphasising that it is for the people of Thailand as a whole to decide upon Thailand&rsquo;s future government.</P>
        <P>I recognise that a difficult political situation had prevailed in the country for some time; that the coup was carried out without bloodshed; that the coup leaders agreed to abide by the United Nations Charter and international law; that they received the endorsement by King Bhumipol Adulyadej to create an interim Government; that some powers, at least, are being transferred to the newly-appointed interim Prime Minister, and the Cabinet due to be appointed this week; and that a commitment has been given to holding elections within a year, and to the restoration of full democratic government thereafter.</P>
        <P>However, the Irish Government &ndash; as a fundamental principle &mdash; cannot accept military coups as a legitimate way to resolve political difficulties in Thailand, or anywhere else.  While reassured in some respects by the commitments made by the coup leaders, I remain concerned about a number of issues.  My concerns relate, in particular, to the protection of human rights and civil liberties, including freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, during the interim period; to the year-long delay envisaged before elections are held and democratic government restored; to the degree of control still retained by the coup leaders under the new interim Constitution; and the extent to which the people of Thailand and representative groups will be able to input into the drafting of the new Constitution.</P>
        <P>Along with my EU colleagues, I will continue to monitor the situation carefully and use all diplomatic and other channels to ensure compliance with the commitments entered into by the military leaders and interim Government, and the earliest possible return to fully democratic political processes and Government, controlled by the people of Thailand as a whole.</P>

	<P>In my statement on behalf of Ireland to the 61st Session of the UN General Assembly on 26 September, I referred to the particularly grave human rights situation in Burma.  I called, once again, on the Burmese r&eacute;gime to move towards democracy and to release all political prisoners, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi.  At the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) Summit held in Helsinki earlier in September, the Taoiseach also raised the situation in Burma.  He called for the release <Col N="1508"/>of Aung San Suu Kyi and for greater progress towards democracy.</P>
        <P>These statements by the Taoiseach and myself are consistent with the strong position on Burma which Ireland takes on all possible occasions, including in the European Union framework and at the United Nations.  Together with our EU partners, we avail of all opportunities to call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, to condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy in Burma.</P>
        <P>The visit by UN Under-Secretary-General (UN USG) Gambari to Burma from 18-20 May was the first high-level visit to that country by a UN representative in more than two years.  I welcome the fact that he was able to meet with the most senior Burmese leaders as well as with Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of her party, the National League for Democracy, during the visit.  The Burmese government should allow the UN to play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy so that the National Convention, when it resumes its work, can proceed in a more inclusive way.</P>
        <P>The situation in Burma was most recently discussed at the EU General Affairs and External Council Meeting in Luxembourg on 12 June.  On that occasion the possibility of the situation in Burma coming before the UN Security Council was discussed.  Subsequently, the UN Security Council decided to include Burma on its agenda.  On foot of this, UNSG Gambari briefed the Security Council last Friday, 29 September.  This is a welcome development.  In this regard, I welcome the news that UN USG Gambari is due to return to Burma next month.</P>
        <P>The EU applies a range of sanctions and restrictive measures against Burma, referred to as the EU Common Position, which had been due to expire on 30 April but which has been renewed for a further year.  In the absence of any significant progress in Burma, Ireland strongly supported the renewal.</P>
        <P>I will continue to raise concerns about Burma on all possible occasions and to call on the Burmese government to assume its responsibilities towards its people and to allow the fullest possible UN involvement in a genuine process of democratisation and reconciliation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 365 and 366 together.</P>
        <P>Accession negotiations were opened with both Turkey and Croatia on 3 October 2005.  An extensive screening process is currently underway, in which experts from the Commission explain EU rules to the two countries and examine their strategies for adopting and implementing them.  It is expected to take until the end of 2006 to complete the screening process for the required 33 chapters.</P>
        <P>After each chapter has been screened the EU can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether the negotiations in that sector can be opened.  To date, the Commission has presented its reports to the Council on 13 negotiating chapters for Croatia and three for Turkey.  Negotiations have been provisionally closed with both Turkey and Croatia on just one chapter (Science &amp; Research).  Although the screening process with both countries is currently running in parallel, these are two separate negotiations.  At this stage, it is not possible to set a timeframe for the completion of the negotiations with either country.</P>
        <P>Careful preparation of the Union&rsquo;s most recent enlargement has been a key factor in its success.  With regard to the accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia, the EU has confirmed that it will be firm in demanding that they fulfil all the requirements of membership.  Both countries will be expected to maintain their commitment to the full implementation of human rights and other reforms.</P>
        <P>The Union&rsquo;s capacity to absorb new members will also be an important consideration.  If EU membership is to be further extended, the Union will need to ensure that it has the economic, political and institutional capacity to make this possible.  As Turkey&rsquo;s accession could have substantial financial consequences, it is accepted that its negotiations can only be concluded after the establishment of the Union&rsquo;s financial framework for the period beyond 2013.  Speaking on 26 September 2006, Commission President Jose Manuel Barosso suggested that any future enlargement following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania should be contingent on institutional reform so as to ensure that an enlarged Union could function in an efficient manner.</P>
        <P>Ireland has always been supportive of the process of EU enlargement from which we have consistently benefited.  It has been our policy to consider each candidate on the basis of its own merits.  This principle will continue to underpin our approach to the negotiations with both Turkey and Croatia.  Both countries benefit from <Col N="1510"/>the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; Bilateral Assistance Programme, which provides support for candidate countries as they prepare for the considerable challenges of EU membership.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has raised the issue of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay with the US Authorities on numerous occasions, with concerns being raised at the highest level when the Taoiseach, accompanied by myself, met with President Bush in Washington on 17 March 2006.  We have always made it clear that we believe that detainees must be treated in accordance with the requirements of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.  This position is shared by the EU as a whole and these views were expressed at the EU-US Summit which took place in Vienna on 21 June 2006.  The EU urged that detainees be either charged or released and that Guantanamo be closed.  I have made it clear that I believe that the Guantanamo Bay camp should be closed as soon as possible.  Repeatedly, President Bush has also stated his intention to ultimately close the Guantanamo facility, which I welcome.</P>
        <P>On 6 September, President Bush stated that prisoners at Guantanamo Bay would be given access to the International Committee of the Red Cross in compliance with the Geneva Conventions.  In compliance with a US Supreme Court ruling in June this year, draft legislation providing for the treatment and trial before military tribunals of detainees was put forward by the White House in early September.  The bill was subject to vigorous debate and revision in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, which included the successful efforts by key Senators to ensure the application of the provisions of the Geneva Convention, notably those concerning Common Article 3.  The bill was subsequently passed on 28 September and the President is expected to sign it into law in the coming days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While significant progress has been achieved in Afghanistan over the past four years very considerable challenges still remain, above all on the security front.  In any country, developing the democratic structures, institutions and administrative systems necessary to provide essential public services and to ensure a secure environment for all its people is a process that takes time.  The Afghan people have elected a President and a Parliament and have a legitimate elected Government which is working to consolidate the progress that has already been made.  A Chief Justice is now in place as is a new Prosecutor General who has launched a major initiative against corruption.  Members of the Parliament, the Wolesi Jirga, have recently formed parliamentary groups.  The reform process is continuing with the assistance of the international community across all sectors, including the administrative and judicial systems, the police service and the army.</P>
        <P>Ensuring security in Afghanistan is an especially challenging and complex task, particularly given the presence of violent factions who stand to benefit considerably from a destabilised country.  The security situation remains a cause of serious concern.  Levels of insurgency-related violence and fatalities have risen since the beginning of the year and attacks, including suicide bombings, aimed at the UN mandated International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), other international security forces and Afghan security forces, have increased.</P>
        <P>The level of insurgency intensified in recent months in the context of ISAF assuming control for the Southern region of Afghanistan, a deployment which took effect on 31 July.  The Afghan National Army (ANA) and ISAF have since been engaged in heavy fighting with Taliban insurgents in the South.  ISAF has been combining military operations in the South, mainly around Kandahar, with its more conventional peace-keeping duties in the rest of the country.  The main phase of this operation has now been successfully completed and has resulted in ANA and ISAF being able to establish themselves in erstwhile key centres of Taliban resistance. ISAF, under NATO leadership, will shortly deploy to the eastern part of Afghanistan, hitherto the exclusive domain of the ANA and the US-led international coalition, Operation Enduring Freedom.  At that point ISAF will be responsible for security assistance in the whole country.  At the same time, the continuing challenge from the Taliban is clearly very worrying.</P>
        <P>The illicit narcotics industry also remains a major challenge to the long-term security, development and effective governance of Afghanistan.  In co-operation with the international community, the Afghan Government operates a Counter Narcotics Implementation Plan and a National Drugs Control Strategy in an <Col N="1512"/>effort to work towards elimination of the narcotics trade.  Reported statistics for the 2005-2006 opium crop are disappointing.  Though eradication rose by 210%, production is believed to have still increased significantly.  Counter narcotics efforts will be a particularly important challenge in the period ahead.</P>
        <P>An Afghanistan Compact was launched at the International Conference on Afghanistan in London on 31 January/1 February and was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1659 (2006) on 15 February.  The Compact will guide the joint efforts of the Afghan Government and the international community in meeting outstanding challenges across three pillars of activity: security; governance; rule of law and human rights, and economic and social development.  Counter-narcotics was identified as a cross-cutting priority in the Compact.  The Compact notes that Afghanistan&rsquo;s transition to peace and stability is not yet assured and that strong international engagement will be required to address remaining challenges.  Ireland pledged &euro;5 million at the launch of the Compact, which will be expended over the next two years.  Ireland has contributed a total of &euro;22 million to reconstruction and recovery programmes in Afghanistan since January 2002.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 2004, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for determining entitlement to post-nuptial citizenship.  This includes post-nuptial declarations made by persons resident abroad that were submitted to our Embassies and Consulates.</P>
        <P>The statutory provisions providing for post-nuptial citizenship were repealed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, which came into effect on 30 November 2002.  A transition provision contained in that Act enabled persons who married Irish citizens prior to 30 November 2002 to make a post-nuptial declaration on or before 29 November 2005.</P>
        <P>The final months of the transition period saw a substantial increase in the numbers of declarations received by our Embassies and Consulates, with approximately 10,400 received between 1 January and 29 November, 2005.  This was more than five times the number received in all of 2004.  My Department has so far completed its processing of 4,329 of these declarations and their supporting documents.  Efforts are being made to process the remaining applications as quickly as possible while ensuring that legal requirements <Col N="1513"/>are fully met.  Declarations found to be in order are forwarded to the Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform, which issues the Certificates of Declaration accepting Irish Citizenship.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 375 to 380, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that further significant progress has been made by my Department since my comprehensive and detailed presentation to the Joint Committee on our Olympic and Paralympic preparations on 24th May 2006.</P><Col N="1516"/>
        <P>Following Government approval, in July, together with the Taoiseach, I launched the Irish Institute of Sport and announced the appointment of its Executive Chairman to deliver optimal support services for Olympic and Paralympic athletes and sports.  The Institute will address such issues as strength and conditioning, psychology, performance analysis, sports medicine &amp; sports injury management, recruitment of elite coaches and athlete lifestyle support.</P>
        <P>In the lead up to Beijing the Institute will focus its support on 14 focus sports and approximately 90 Olympic and Paralympic athletes who are currently graded as either Contracted World Class or International Class under the Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s (ISC) International Carding Scheme.  In line with the recommendations of the 2005 Athens Review, the ISC undertook a full review of the International Carding Scheme in 2005, which includes annual funding for athletes, and a new Scheme is in operation since January 2006.</P>
        <P>The Government-approved proposals for the restructuring of the support structures of Irish elite sport will also see the National Coaching and Training Centre (NCTC), based at the University of Limerick, reconstituted as a new entity called Coaching Ireland with a specific remit focusing on coach development and education.  Quality coaching is central to the development of sport at every level.  The agency and the facilities based at the University of Limerick will have a key role in the preparation of our elite sportsmen and women as indeed will the other third level universities and colleges who are making increasingly significant contributions to the achievement of sporting excellence.</P>
        <P>In August, I established the London 2012 Olympics Task Force to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from its proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London 2012.  The taskforce which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department has been asked to examine all possible opportunities, identify the priority areas of interest and map out a strategy to ensure that Ireland will benefit from its proximity to London in 2012.  It will draw on the expertise of people from across the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors supported by staff within my Department.</P>
        <P>The ISC continues to make excellent progress in its preparation for Beijing 2008 and London 2012.  Arising from the Athens Review 2005, the ISC developed an operational plan which identified key performance indicators, timescales and costings and the roles of the various agencies in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s Olympic and Paralympic preparations for Beijing and London.  The plan encompassed elements such as the introduction of targeted sport performance plans including prioritising junior, development and elite athletes; a review of the international carding scheme; proposals for the development of an Irish <Col N="1517"/>Institute of Sport; maintaining and enhancing the role of the Olympic and Paralympic Performance Committees to ensure optimum cooperation in the preparation and performance of the Irish team for the Beijing and London Olympic Games, and the strengthening of the Olympic Council of Ireland&rsquo;s administrative capability.  The operational plan is updated on a regular basis with the key agencies to reflect the current status of the recommendations and significant progress has been made to date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is also funding the development of a network of top quality facilities around the country designed to meet the training, coaching and competition needs of our elite competitors in a wide spectrum of sports.  Among the major projects which have been supported are the National Aquatic Centre, the National Rowing Centre at Inniscarra, the National Tennis Centre at Glasnevin, the National Boxing Stadium and the National Hockey Stadium at UCD.  We intend to continue to develop additional facilities of this nature and the Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with Phase 1 of the Sports Campus at Abbotstown is further evidence of our commitment in ensuring that our sportspersons have available to them facilities in which they can train and compete.  The Institute of Sport will be located at the sports campus at Abbotstown, forming an essential part of the new National Sports Campus.  Until the facilities there come on stream the Institute will service athletes needs through existing facilities.</P>
        <P>The ISC has established Focus Sport Funding and performance plans have been agreed with targeted Olympic and Paralympic sports.  The performance plans focus on sustainable performance and development of junior, developmental and senior squads for 2008, 2012 and 2016.  High Performance coaching gaps have been identified and key coaching appointments have been made.  The ISC has carried out rigorous quarterly monitoring and evaluation of the performance plans.</P>
        <P>The ISC also works in partnership with the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Paralympic Council of Ireland, and the relevant Olympic governing bodies of sport in the preparation and participation of Irish competitors at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  Significant progress has been made to date in the preparation for Beijing 2008 including the establishment of athletes commissions and preparation of acclimatisation strategies.  The OCI has also held a Teamship conference for athletes, coaches and support personnel in January 2006 and a second conference is planned for December 2006.  The PCI has arranged for multi-sport camps to take place in the University of Limerick in April and November 2007.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that there now exists a co-ordinated approach to the preparation of our elite sportspersons for participation in international competitions and I am confident that this <Col N="1518"/>co-ordinated structure will ensure the maximum return for Beijing 2008 and London 2012 and will provide a legacy in high performance sport.</P>

For as long as the RIA continues to use Mosney, subject to Mosney Irish Holidays plc being willing and in a position to make the venue available for this purpose, the Community Games can avail of the facilities there.  A new contract for the use of the Centre was signed between Mosney Irish Holidays Ltd and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 18th November 2004.</P>

        <P>The employer in this case failed to respond to a number of requests made by the Department in the period May to September, 2005.  In the circumstances, the Department requested the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, on 7 October 2005, to institute legal proceedings under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 against the employer in order to secure, with interest accrued, the compensation awarded. It is understood that in January this year the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office referred the file to the State Solicitor for the area in which the employer ordinarily resides.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Unemployment is measured through the quarterly national household survey as published by the Central Statistics Office.  The survey does not provide data on specific towns and is available on a regional basis only.  The most recent data published in September 2006 show that the unemployment rate for the south-west region, which includes Tralee, is 3.7%, a decrease of 0.5% in the year.  This compares favourably with the national rate of 4.3%.  In addition there were 14,400 more persons in employment in the south-west region in the year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The latest live register data for Tralee show that there are 3,219 people on the register in Tralee, an increase of 171 in the year.  However, the live register is not designed to measure unemployment.  As well as showing the numbers claiming unemployment assistance and benefit it also includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers who would be entitled to unemployment benefit.  A range of measures are being implemented by agencies under the aegis of the Department to continue to increase job creation and reduce unemployment in the area.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland continue to promote County Kerry and the advantages of locating there which include a young skilled population, the presence of an institute of technology, and the availability of first class business parks and a regional airport.  During 2005, 104 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies.  The agency is also working closely with existing clients in Kerry to encourage them to expand their operations.  It is also working with a wide range of bodies at local level, including F&Aacute;S, to enhance the attractiveness of the county for investment.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S engages with redundant workers in a process involving information sessions, skills, audits, and re-training.  It also explores new start-ups in whole or in part by the industrial development agencies.  A wide range of measures are also currently being implemented by F&Aacute;S in Tralee, such as jobs clubs, community employment, return to work job initiative and the national employment action plan referral process.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development had 16 companies operating from the Kerry Technology Park initiative at the end of 2005.  Employment in these companies increased by 55 during the year.  The agency has approved a &euro;1.5 million support package for two Kerry-based indigenous companies: Altobridge Limited and Freeflow.  The support will lead to increased research and development <Col N="1521"/>activity and generate an additional 43 jobs at Kerry Technology Park over the next five years.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of investment and jobs for Kerry in general and Tralee in particular.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 and 390 together.</P>
        <P>The marketing of individual areas, including Cavan and Monaghan, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for IDA Ireland.  While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>IDA&rsquo;s regional strategy has been to adopt a focused approach to marketing, selecting specific towns in each region and setting targets for new investment.  This year, for example, IDA has a target to secure a new investment in the medical devices area for Cavan town as it believes the existing 23,745 sq ft facility in its Cavan Business Park is particularly suited to this sector.  The sector should not compete with existing businesses in the town for potential employees.   This approach has been very successful in other towns in the region such as Dundalk and Drogheda where significant investments have been secured over the last 12 months.</P>
        <P>There are a limited number of potential new FDI projects at any given time and it is not possible to have a specific target for each town.  Should a project be secured for Cavan the focus would then shift to Monaghan.  This does not preclude IDA Ireland from marketing each town on an ongoing basis and the agency responds to all enquiries by potential investors.  Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate are taken by the investors and IDA Ireland can only advise and market the attractions of potential sites, and work towards convincing investors that these sites meet their requirements.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has also been exploring the possibility of developing a new Park in Monaghan.  The County Council has been working closely <Col N="1522"/>with the agency in this process.  IDA intends focusing on upgrading its site at Knockaconny in the coming years to make it compatible with the needs of modern business.  I welcome the decision of the county development fund to seek planning permission for the provision of a new office facility on this site and am assured by IDA Ireland that they will undertake to actively market it for new investment.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland have also assured me that they are actively engaged with a range of local bodies in the Border region such as the county development boards, local authorities, utility providers, third level institutes and private sector property providers, in order to enhance the attractiveness of the counties as potential sites for new investment.  To successfully compete with other locations internationally, it is vital that the regions in Ireland strive to match the requirements of overseas investors.  I am confident that the completion of the M3 motorway, which will facilitate access to the airport, will improve the prospects for additional investment and jobs for the people of Cavan and Monaghan.</P>

	<P>It is widely acknowledged, as in the recent National Disability Authority publication &ldquo;A Strategy of Engagement&rdquo; that the participation rates of disabled people in employment are significantly less than those of their non-disabled peers.</P>
        <P>The National Disability Authority publication indicated, for example, that between 1997 and 2004 there was an absolute decrease of 62% in the number of long term unemployed welfare recipients, whereas in the case of recipients of welfare payments related to illness or disability the absolute number increased by 42%.  For every long term unemployed welfare recipient in 1997 there were 1.1 persons in receipt of a sickness/disability related payment &ndash; by 2004 the latter figure had risen to four persons.</P>
        <P>The Department is fully committed to addressing the needs of those with disabilities, and furthering the policy of mainstreaming services to help them play a full and active part in Irish society.</P><Col N="1523"/>
        <P>In July of this year the Department published its Sectoral Plan as one of six Government Departments required to publish Sectoral Plans under the Disability Act, 2005.  The Plan outlines the Department&rsquo;s key initiatives in promoting equal opportunities for disabled people in the employment market, which includes the development of a Comprehensive Employment Strategy for disabled people.  Key pillars underpinning this strategy will be enhancing the effectiveness of employment and vocational training programmes for disabled people, and further developing supports for  the employment of disabled people.  Inter-Departmental collaboration will be a key element of the implementation of the Strategy and this is reflected in Protocols attached to the Sectoral Plan.</P>
        <P>The Plan represents a clear move forward in improving access to employment for disabled people, and provides a comprehensive outline of this Department&rsquo;s commitment in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Department currently exceeds the 3% requirement under the Disability Act, 2005 for the employment of people with disabilities, with 4.27% of total staff employed having a disability.  In addition, all of the agencies under the aegis of the Department are aware of their obligations under the Act and the majority have achieved the 3% target.</P>
        <P>The Department is continuing to monitor and record compliance with the 3% quota by the agencies under its aegis, and information in this regard will be transmitted to the National Disability Authority in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act, 2005.  A co-ordinated strategy is in place among the agencies concerned, including the preparation of Codes of Practice on the employment of people with disabilities, and the maintenance of proper records regarding the employment of people with disabilities, subject to confidentiality and privacy requirements.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is responsible for policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service.  I understand that the Department of Finance is working with the National Disability Authority to develop a tool to effectively monitor the number of staff with disabilities employed in the Civil and Public Service.  This is being done in consultation with the Disability Liaison Officers Network, which was established to share information between Departments, and which includes the Disability Liaison Officer in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The living alone allowance or living alone increase as it is now known, is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.  The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone. </P>
        <P>The payment was last increased in 1996.  From November 1996 to August 2006, the consumer price index rose by 38.1%.  The living alone increase is a targeted measure aimed at a particular group of pensioners.  The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than focusing on payments such as the living alone increase.  This approach ensures that resources are used to improve the position of all pensioners.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to increasing the level of the basic state pension to &euro;200 per week by 2007.  Further significant progress towards achieving this target was made in budget 2006, which provided for increases in pensions of up to &euro;14 and &euro;16 per week.  The maximum rate of the state pension (contributory), formally the old age contributory pension is now &euro;193.30 per week with the maximum non-contributory pension paid at &euro;182 per week.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that appli<Col N="1525"/>cations are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the relevant eligibility conditions.</P>
        <P>Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is based on the applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s benefit is based on the applicant satisfying medical, PRSI contributions, and employment and residency conditions.</P>
        <P>Budget 2005 extended entitlement to the respite care grant to all full time carers irrespective of means or contribution record but subject to certain conditions regarding the provision of full time care and attention.  The grant in respect of 2006 is payable to people who meet the qualifying conditions on Thursday 1 June and is payable on or as soon as practicable after that date.</P>
        <P>In determining entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit or the respite care grant there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable correct decisions to be made.</P>
        <P>Respite care grant has been paid to all eligible people who are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s  benefit.  Respite care grant has also been paid to all those who received the grant in 2005 and who are eligible for the 2006 grant.  Taken together, this amounts to over 30,000 cases.</P>
        <P>Some 900 cases remain to be finalised.  These are new claims received from people who are not in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit and who did not receive the respite care grant in 2005.  The average time for deciding these claims is currently eight weeks.</P>
        <P>The average time for deciding an application for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit is currently 9.1 weeks and eight weeks respectively, although in many cases claims are processed within a far shorter timeframe.  The average length of time taken to deal with carer&rsquo;s allowance appeals by the social welfare appeals office in 2005 was 23 weeks.  If allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time falls to eight weeks.</P>
        <P>The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by my Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further advice by the Department&rsquo;s medical assessor in certain cases and the holding of oral hearings.</P>
        <P>Circumstances can arise, normally outside the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which can have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals.  The staff and other resources available to my Department must be deployed to ensure good customer service, to prevent fraud and abuse of the schemes and to achieve value for money.  My Department is engaged in an ongoing process to ensure that available resources are prioritised to the greatest extent possible on front line service delivery and <Col N="1526"/>to ensure that the best possible standard of response is provided across the range of schemes and services.</P>

	<P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel. </P>
        <P>The free travel companion pass entitles the pass holder to have any one person, aged 16 years or over, to accompany him/her free of charge when travelling.  Such companion passes are available to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.  These eligible for a companion pass include people who are receiving full-time care and attention from someone who is in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance; people aged 75 years or over, who are medically unfit to travel unaccompanied; people who are blind or severely visually impaired; and people in receipt of certain social welfare type illness or disability payments.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 10 April 2006.  The deciding officer disallowed the claim on 30 June 2006 on the grounds that the person&rsquo;s means exceeded the means limits for that scheme.  The means in question are derived from farming, where there is a disregard of the first &euro;580 of weekly income for a married couple in carers cases, while claimants <Col N="1527"/>for disability allowance are assessed with half the net income. </P>
        <P>She appealed against this decision to the social welfare appeals office.  Having considered all of the available evidence, the Appeals Officer disallowed her appeal on 28 September 2006 and she was notified of the decision on that date.</P>

	<P>My Department is conscious of the need to control and prevent abuse of the free travel scheme.

        <P>My Department is currently working towards the introduction of a more secure free travel card which will include photo identification and this is expected to be introduced during 2007.

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the last budget, I announced a wide range of important measures for non-contributory pensioners, including farmers.  These included: an increase of &euro;16 per week (9.6%) for all non-contributory pensions, which means that significant progress has been made towards the achievement of the government&rsquo;s commitment to bring the basic state pension to over &euro;200 per week by 2007; an increase in the fuel allowance by &euro;5 per week (56%), from &euro;9 to &euro;14, and an increase in the over-80 allowance by &euro;3.60 per week (also 56%), from &euro;6.40 to &euro;10.</P>
        <P>I also announced that I proposed to establish, with effect from September last, a new pension scheme, to be known as the State pension non-contributory.  This replaces the old age non-contributory pension and, for recipients aged 66 and over, blind pension, widower&rsquo;s pension, one parent family payment, deserted wife&rsquo;s allowance and prisoner&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s allowance.  This initiative will cost &euro;20 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>All these schemes currently feature a common means disregard of &euro;7.60 per week, which has not increased since the 1970s.  This general disregard is being significantly increased in the new non-contributory pension to &euro;20 per week, an increase of &euro;12.40 per week.  Approximately, 34,000 pensioners who are currently in receipt of a reduced <Col N="1529"/>rate of payment will gain from this change, including many thousands of farmers and farming widows.  Persons in receipt of the personal rate of pension will benefit by up to &euro;12.50 per week while an additional 1,900 pensioners with a qualified adult will gain by up to &euro;20.80 per week.  These increases are effective from Friday 29 September.</P>
        <P>The State pension (non-contributory) and the existing widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pension also has a specific additional earnings disregard of &euro;100 per week where the pensioner is in employment i.e. working for an employer.  This disregard is intended as an initial incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce.  It means that the first &euro;100 of weekly earnings will not be taken into account when assessing entitlement to the new pension.</P>
        <P>The budget did not provide for the proposed disregard to apply to income from any other source such as self-employment including farming or rents from leasing property.  Income from sources other than employment, including pensions and capital, is covered by the enhanced general means disregard of &euro;20 per week referred to above.  In contrast to persons in employment, any expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out any form of self-employment have always been disregarded when calculating means from self-employment.  This means that such earnings are assessed net of expenses incurred by the person in the course of their work.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that there are special arrangements for farmers participating in the REPS and SACS schemes.  The first &euro;2,540 of all income from these schemes is not assessable for means test purposes and 50% of any balance is assessed.  Any expenses necessarily incurred to participate in these schemes are also disregarded.</P>
        <P>By any standards, the levels of increases and revised means test arrangements announced in the budget were exceptional.  Any further improvements such as the enhancement of disregards for farmers and others would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s <Col N="1530"/>benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>One of the fundamental qualification conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance is that the applicant must be providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care.  Since the introduction of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme this full time care and attention requirement has been eased in order to facilitate carers in engaging in employment, education or training.</P>
        <P>Until June this year people could engage in employment outside the home for up to 10 hours per week and still qualify for payment.  Since then, I have increased the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home and still satisfy the qualifying conditions for payment, from 10 to 15 hours per week.  This improvement applies to carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant.</P>
        <P>In 2005 I extended the respite care grant to all those providing full time care and attention regardless of means or household composition.  Since then a grant has been paid in respect of each person for whom the carer is providing full time care and attention.  In Budget 2006 I increased the level of the grant and it is now paid at &euro;1,200 per year in respect of each care recipient.</P>
        <P>The person to whom the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers is employed outside the home for 32 hours per week and, as such, does not meet the qualifying conditions for the respite care grant.  The Health Services Executive (HSE) is responsible for the provision of respite care services.  The lady in question may be eligible for some of those services and I would suggest she contact her local HSE office in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me.  I will continue to strive to bring forward proposals that recognise and support the valued and valuable contribution of all carers in a tangible way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to education allowance or BTEA is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  The purpose of the allowance is to replace the weekly social welfare payment that the applicant will have been receiving.  The allow<Col N="1531"/>ance is not payable to people who are not social welfare recipients.  The requirement to which the Deputy refers is designed to ensure that the BTEA is targeted appropriately.</P>
        <P>At present, to qualify for participation in the scheme an applicant must be, prior to commencing an approved course of study, at least 21 years of age (18 for people with disabilities).  Lone parents and unemployed persons may access the scheme at 18 years if they are out of formal education for 2 years or more.  An applicant must also be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications.  The twelve month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan.</P>
        <P>The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.</P>

	<P>In the current year, I have met with one group representing unmarried fathers.  The group in question, the Unmarried Fathers of Ireland, received funding in 2005 from the Agency.  The Unmarried Fathers of Ireland received a grant of &euro;3,000 towards the provision of counselling.  Another group, the Unmarried and Separated Fathers of Ireland, received a grant for &euro;4,000 towards the provision of marriage and relationship counselling.  Also in 2005, Parental Equality received the third instalment of a three year budget allocation of &euro;20,000 per year for the provision of a parenting course.</P>
        <P>The Unmarried and Separated Fathers of Ireland has corresponded with me this year on a number of issues of relevance to their members and has also been advised by my officials that core funding for voluntary groups is not available from my Department.  None of the groups mentioned above has applied for funding under the 2006 grants scheme administered by the Family Support Agency.</P>
        <P>Two other fathers&rsquo; groups were funded by my Department in 2005 under the Family Services Project, which aims to provide a high quality information service on the range of supports available to families from state agencies and from <Col N="1532"/>the voluntary and community sector with a particular emphasis on the services available locally.  The Tallaght Flexible Unit received &euro;15,000 in February 2005 for a programme aimed at improving unemployed men&rsquo;s role as fathers and the Vulnerable Fathers Support Group in Sligo received &euro;2,310 in September 2005.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme (BSCFA) operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year.</P>
        <P>The BSCFA scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn.  The allowance is intended as a contribution towards meeting the cost of school clothing and footwear.  The issue of school books are a matter for the Department of Education and Science and that Department separately operates a book grant scheme for primary and secondary schools.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for payment of back to school clothing and footwear allowance, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, be participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.</P>
        <P>Family income supplement is a qualifying payment for these purposes.  The amount of FIS paid is not assessed against the applicant in the BSCFA means test.  The income limits for a couple with one child is EUR 441.40 per week while for a lone parent with one child is EUR 314.90.  A person working a 40 hour week at the national minimum wage would satisfy this means test.  It is estimated that some 78,000 families will benefit under the scheme this year at a cost of EUR 25m.</P>
        <P>Budget 2006 provided for a number of improvements to the scheme.  These include an increase of EUR 40 in the rate payable which means that, from June 2006, an allowance of EUR 120 is payable in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years and EUR 190 in respect of qualified children aged from 12 to 22 years.  This represents an increase of 50% and 26% respectively over the amount paid last year.  They also include an extension of entitlement to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance to recipients of guardian&rsquo;s (formerly orphan&rsquo;s) payments for the first time; and an increase in the additional income disregard for entitlement to the scheme from EUR 50 to EUR 100.</P>
        <P>The new income limits for the BSCFA scheme for 2006 are based on the maximum rate of state <Col N="1534"/>pension (contributory) (under 80) plus  EUR 100 in the case of married and cohabiting couples; and the maximum rate of widow&rsquo;s/widower&rsquo;s contributory pension (under 80) plus EUR 100 for lone parents, plus child dependant allowance in each case.</P>
        <P>It might be noted that these improvements in BSCFA are very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends.  According to the Consumer Price Index for August 2006, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by 3.6% over the past twelve months.  Since December 2001, clothing and footwear costs have decreased by 18.8%.</P>
        <P>I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  I am satisfied that the improvements to the scheme for this year provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.  Any further improvements to the scheme, including the issue of extending the allowance to employed parents on low income, would have to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare payments generally.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the Community Wel<Col N="1535"/>fare Service of the Health Service Executive on my behalf.  The establishment of the Health Service Executive prompted a fresh consideration of the role and structure of the Community Welfare Service, and of the most appropriate location for the service in the future.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service noted over the years the health system had been assigned responsibility for a number of services which might be regarded as non-core activities.  It recommended that the Government consider assigning non-core activities currently undertaken by agencies within the health service to other bodies.</P>
        <P>The Government decided to ask an interdepartmental group to examine this issue.  The report of the interdepartmental group was subsequently submitted to, and accepted by, the Government.  The report recommends, among other things, that income support and maintenance schemes, together with associated resources, should be transferred to my Department.  I welcome this decision as it provides an opportunity to bring about positive change for customers and staff and it is, I believe, a logical approach to provision of these services.</P>
        <P>Given the organisational, human resource and industrial relations implications of the transfer proposal, consultations with all stakeholders is part of the process to implement the decision.  In this regard, a working group comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, has been established and is progressing its implementation.</P>
        <P>The working group is undertaking extensive consultation with all relevant stakeholders and will continue to do so throughout the programme of change.  This will include consultation with those who deliver the service and service users.  A priority in the context of the transfer process will be to support the high standard of service currently provided by staff in the community welfare service.</P>
        <P>The transfer is a major change for all involved but I am confident it will be embraced successfully and will ultimately further enhance the delivery of service to our customers, in particular those most disadvantaged in the community.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The social security rights of people liv<Col N="1536"/>ing and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72.  The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  This is achieved primarily by setting out rules as to which State&rsquo;s social security system a person will pay contributions to when, for example, s/he moves from one Member State to another to take up work or where s/he lives in one State and works another.  In addition, the Regulations also set out rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, sickness, unemployment, old-age etc.</P>
        <P>The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which s/he works.  Equally, the state of employment has, in general, responsibility for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes ill.  The Regulations also provide that when entitlement to benefit is being examined account must be taken of insurance paid in any other Member State where the person worked.</P>
        <P>As a general rule, a person who has worked in Ireland and who meets the qualifying conditions for Illness Benefit may continue to receive that benefit in accordance with Irish legislation regardless of which Member State the person is residing or staying in.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410 and 411 together.</P>
        <P>On the 28th of September 2006 I was pleased to introduce a new enhanced standard State Non-Contributory pension.  The changes announced take effect from Friday, 29th September for those over 66 years and include significant increases in the means disregard from &euro;7.60 per week to &euro;20 per week.</P><Col N="1537"/>
        <P>Over 30,000 pensioners who were in receipt of a reduced rate of payment have gained from this change.  The changes were automatically applied by my Department without inconvenience to the pensioner.  The increase in the personal rate of payment for the pensioners benefiting from this change will be up to &euro;12.50 per week while the qualified adult rate, where applicable, will increase by up to &euro;8.30 per week.</P>
        <P>No change in means assessment has been required as a result of the increase in the means disregard to &euro;20 per week, with means assessment calculations continuing to be made as heretofore before applying the disregard to the total weekly means assessed.  Hence a single person, with no other means, will be able to have up to &euro;36,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate.  This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.</P>
        <P>Capital is assessed from the savings, investments, cash-on-hands and property (excluding the pensioners own home).  The value of all of these items is added together and a formula is applied to their total value to calculate the weekly means as follows:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 412 and 413 together.</P>
        <P>In the last Budget, I announced a wide range of important measures for non-contributory pensioners.  These included a significant increase in the means disregard from &euro;7.60 per week to &euro;20 per week.  Consequent on the increase in the means disregard to &euro;20 per week a single person, with no other means, can have up to &euro;36,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate.  These figures are doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.</P><Col N="1538"/>
        <P>As part of the pension reforms, I also announced a specific additional disregard of &euro;100 per week where the pensioner is in employment.  This new disregard, relating to earnings from employment, is intended as an incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce.</P>
        <P>The effect of this disregard is that the first &euro;100 of weekly earnings from employment that a pensioner has will be disregarded from the means test.  A similar disregard will apply to the pensioner&rsquo;s spouse or partner.  The disregard will also apply to people under age 66 who are in receipt of a widow/er&rsquo;s non-contributory pension, deserted wife&rsquo;s allowance and prisoner&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>The rate of pension awarded is based on a means test and income above &euro;100 of earnings is included for the assessment of means.  Also included is the value of capital (such as savings and investment) and property (other than the pensioners own home.)</P>
        <P>Once the weekly means of the pensioner have been established, the weekly income disregard of &euro;20 is applied.  Any income amount remaining after the disregards have been applied reduces the maximum pension payable, based on a scheduled table of income bands.  Each increase in weekly means of amounts up to &euro;2.50 has the effect of reducing the pension payable by &euro;2.50 per week.  In a case such as the example quoted, where a pensioner has earnings from employment of up to &euro;100 per week and capital of &euro;35,000 with no other means, a pension at the maximum rate is payable.</P>

Section 29 of the Harbours Act 1996 provides that such audits may take place, but there is no <Col N="1539"/>obligation on the Minister to do so.  A performance audit was competed in spring 2001.  Submission of this audit report to Government was delayed due to legal actions.  However, the report was approved by Government and laid before the Oireachtas in July 2006.</P>
        <P>In summary, the audit found that the eight State port companies operating in 2001 managed very different ports; that the companies had successfully accommodated rapid traffic growth; were generally adapting to a more commercial mindset; and were becoming cost efficient and customer focused.</P>
        <P>The Department has no plans at present to commission another composite performance audit of all the State port companies.

        <P>The Policy Statement states that the state owned ports, as commercial entities, should be capable of funding their operations and infrastructure requirements without relying on Exchequer support.  Such funding, if available, would only be considered after other funding opportunities available to the ports themselves were fully exhausted (e.g. through efficiencies, optimum use of existing resources, port charge adjustments, borrowings and private sector investment).</P>

	<P>A number of projects under way or in planning under Transport 21, will be of significant benefit to commuters on the Kilcock to Dublin route.  Railway services to Kilcock have benefited from the major investment in recent years on the Dublin-Sligo line, where, since 1999, over &euro;150 million has been invested.  This investment has funded track renewal, re-signalling, level crossings, platform lengthening and other safety investment.  Investment also covered the new rail car fleet introduced in December 2005 on the route, which delivered an increase in services from three each way per day to five each way per day. </P><Col N="1542"/>
        <P>In 2005, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann placed orders for 150 high-specification Intercity rail cars, funded under Transport 21, at a cost of &euro;322 million, to serve the national Intercity network, including Dublin-Sligo.  These rail cars are set to enter service during 2007 and 2008, with Dublin-Sligo scheduled to be the first route to benefit from the new fleet in 2007.  This will enable services to increase on the route to every two hours each way.</P>
        <P>The M4 Leixlip to M50 junction road scheme is scheduled to commence construction in 2007.  This scheme will involve the widening of the N4 to 3 lanes from the M50 roundabout to the existing M4 Motorway at Leixlip, with the provision of a grade-separated interchange (flyover) at the Newcastle Road junction.</P>
        <P>This work comes in addition to the substantial upgrading which has already been undertaken on this route in recent years including the bypass of Kilcock itself.  The works now being planned will further increase the capacity of this route to deal with the growing number of commuters living in the catchment area of the N4.</P>
        <P>Phase 1 of the M50 Upgrade Project has started on the carriageway between the N7 and N4 interchanges and is due for completion in mid-2008.  Phase 1 includes the replacement of the existing M50/N4 roundabout with a freeflow junction which, coupled with the N4 widening works, should result in improved traffic flow from the M4/N4 to the city centre and via the upgraded M50 to the greater Dublin Region.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the recent European Transport Safety Council survey that placed Ireland seventh from bottom among EU countries for the reduction of road deaths since 2000; the way in which he proposes to attain the EU target of cutting road deaths by 50 per cent by <Col N="1543"/>2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary target of the Governments Irish Road Safety Strategy 2004 &ndash; 2006 is to reduce road deaths to no more than 300 per annum by the end of 2006.  The most recent European Transport Safety Council report ranks Ireland 7th from the bottom of EU countries in terms of improving road safety over the last four years.  The Report states that &ldquo;in Ireland traffic deaths are on the rise following the positive development in 2002/2003&rdquo;.  The latter relates to the period when penalty points were first introduced and rigorously enforced.  </P>
        <P>The report does not reflect the key changes in the road safety areas that I have introduced in 2005 and 2006.  As Minister I have put in place a combination of measures and road safety campaigns which are in line with those countries which have achieved the best results in terms of road safety.  The Government is working to reduce the level of road deaths through a number of key initiatives that have been implemented during the last two years.  We have invested millions in new, improved and safer roads.  A major extension of the application of the penalty points system to a total of 36 offences, has been implemented with a continued focus on driver behaviour and key safety issues.  Fixed charges now apply to almost 60 offences.  The Road Traffic Act 2006 includes a number of the key measures.  These include the provision enabling Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) checkpoints to be set up, a ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving, and the legislative provision supporting the operation of privately operated speed cameras.  This legislation addresses issues outstanding in the current Road Safety Strategy that required primary legislation particularly in the key problem areas of drink driving and speeding.  Fixed charges and penalty points apply to the offence of driving while using a mobile phone since 1st September 2006.  The Road Safety Authority is now in place.  This provides a focus for a wide range of road safety related matters that were previously spread across the Department of Transport, the National Safety Council and the National Roads Authority.</P>
        <P>A dedicated Garda Traffic Corps, established at the end of 2004, and headed by an Assistant Commissioner, has been significantly augmented in 2005 and 2006.  At the start of 2006, the total dedicated strength of the Garda Traffic Corps stood at 520 all ranks.  By 2008, a total of 1,200 garda&iacute; will be part of the Traffic Corps.</P>
        <P>In a signal that road safety is now at the very top of the political agenda, the Government has replaced the official&rsquo;s High Level Group with a Ministerial Committee on Road Safety under the chairmanship of the Minister for Transport and <Col N="1544"/>including the Ministers for Justice, Finance, Health, Education and the Attorney General.  This Committee has met on a number of occasions to pursue an integrated approach on all cross cutting issues.</P>
        <P>While I am conscious that the EU target of cutting road deaths by 50% over a ten year period will be difficult to achieve, we will continue to work towards this target.  Since 1998, Ireland has seen an overall reduction 13% reduction in road fatalities despite a 41% increase in the number of vehicles and a 21% increase in drivers.  The number of road deaths in August 2006 at 17 is the lowest number for any month since November 1999.  The August 2006 figure can be compared in the same month in 2005 and 35 in 2004.  22 people lost their lives this September compared to 31 in September 2005.  The level of collisions has also fallen.  The downward trend follows the introduction of roadside Mandatory Alcohol Testing in July.</P>
        <P>While it is important not to base trends on two months&rsquo; statistics, the reduction is a very positive development and it is hoped the increase in the levels of enforcement will continue to have a significant deterrent effect on those who would otherwise drink and drive and the downward trend in the level of deaths will continue.</P>

	<P>The provision of appropriately located Park and Ride <Col N="1546"/>facilities is an important element of Transport 21 and very significant funds have been set aside under Transport 21 for this purpose.  Well-located park and ride facilities can contribute significantly to modal shift to public transport.  Carefully chosen park and ride sites will be a feature of each of the major rail based public transport projects under Transport 21, such as Metro North, Metro West, the extended Luas Green line, Kildare Route Project and the Navan Line.  QBC based Park and Ride facilities will also be located at other strategic locations.</P>
        <P>I have approved a strategy prepared by the Dublin Transportation Office for Park and Ride facilities on the existing and proposed rail network in the Greater Dublin Area.  Local Authorities are examining the most suitable locations for QBC based Park and Ride facilities and will be applying to my Department for funding under Transport 21 for the capital cost of such facilities in due course.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is developing a prioritised Park and Ride development programme, taking account of the Dublin Transportation Office strategy for the development of rail based Park and Ride facilities.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is at present expanding its Park and Ride facilities at Ennis, Mallow and at Leixlip/Louisabridge on the Maynooth line, as these stations were viewed as being in immediate need of expanded Park and Ride facilities.  In addition, as part of its Kildare Route Project, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will be providing park and ride facilities at the new stations to be located at Adamstown, Kishogue, Fonthill Road and Parkwest.</P>
        <P>This year, my Department is providing approximately &euro;1.2 million for these works in Leixlip, &euro;0.7 million for Ennis and &euro;1.3 million for Mallow.  The Railway Procurement Agency has already provided Park and Ride facilities at Red Cow on the Red Line and at Sandyford and Balally on the Green Line, as part of the development of the first Luas lines.  The Agency is in the process of providing further Park and Ride facilities on the Red Line at Tallaght.  Suitable Park and Ride sites for new Luas and Metro projects will be identified as part of the process of selecting route alignment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2005, I had two meetings with representatives of NTR.  Both meetings dealt with the issue of congestion <Col N="1547"/>at the West-Link Bridge and the options for a speedy transition to barrier free tolling.  In the course of both meetings, I emphasised the critical importance of moving to barrier free tolling as quickly as possible. </P>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing, my Department has had contact with NTR in relation to the State&rsquo;s share of the West-Link toll revenues and with NTR and other toll operators in relation to legislative changes necessary to support enforcement of a barrier free toll regime.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads, including the M50, is vested in the National Roads Authority (NRA) under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000).</P>
        <P>In that context, last January, the NRA decided to replace the West-Link toll on the M50 by a single-point barrier free toll in 2008. The installation of barrier-free tolling is a crucial element of the M50 upgrade which is underway at present.  The NRA has initiated a tender competition for the provision of barrier free tolling services with the objective of having barrier free tolling arrangements operational on the M50 by mid 2008.</P>
        <P>I expect that significant improvement in the situation on the M50 will take place in 2008 with the introduction of barrier free tolling, together with the completion of Phase 1 of the upgrade on the road section between the N4 (Galway Road) and Ballymount interchanges along with the interchanges themselves.  Further improvement will take place on completion of the later phases of the upgrade in 2010.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of any issue arising in relation to breaches of the speed limit in the Newtownmountkennedy area so I presume that the Deputy intends to refer to the decisions of Bray District Court earlier this year in connection with the prosecution of breaches of the special speed limit that applies on the N11 in the vicinity of Kilmacanogue village. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The position is that Wicklow County Council are satisfied that special speed limit by-laws have been validly made since April 2004 and that a <Col N="1548"/>lawful and enforceable special speed limit is in place on the stretch of the N11 in question.  Wicklow County Council&rsquo;s by-laws and the special speed limit have not been struck down as unlawful by Bray District Court and there are no grounds therefore for the refund of fixed charge payments made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the deletion of penalty points on the relevant driving licence record.</P>

	<P>The person named received his Single Payment in December 2005 but he had also submitted an application for consideration of Force Majeure /Exceptional Circumstances in relation to the establishment of his entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme.  He made the application on the grounds that his farming production in the reference years had been adversely affected by his medical condition.  This application was initially incorrectly refused on the grounds that the additional medical information requested from the person named was not submitted within <Col N="1550"/>the allowed timeframe.  However, on review it has been discovered that the requested information had, in fact, been forwarded by the person named albeit to another section of the Department.</P>
        <P>Following a re-examination of the circumstances of this case, my Department has decided that the year 2002 will be excluded and the years 2000 and 2001 will be utilised for the purposes of calculating the Single Payment Entitlements of the person named.  This will result in an increased Single Payment.  Arrangements have now been made to issue a supplementary payment in respect of the 2005 Single Payment Scheme and a formal letter will issue to the person named in respect of this decision.</P>

He appealed this decision to the Independent Single Payment Appeals Committee and the Appeals Committee upheld the decision of my Department.

        <P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Categories A, C and D.

	<P>The most recent figures for the national herd indicate that the live cattle population in Ireland on July 1st 2006 was 7.089 million comprising 2.435 million males and 4.654 million females.  These figures are based on an extract from the live cattle population taken from the Cattle Movement Monitoring System (CMMS) database.  The information regarding the number of cows in the country at that time is being compiled at present and will be forwarded to the Deputy when available.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to give a corresponding live cattle population figure for 1st January 2000 taken from the CMMS database as the system was not fully operational at that time.  However, the CSO Livestock Survey for December 1999 showed that the cattle population at that time was 6.707 million &ndash; 2.401 million males and 4.306 million females, of which 2.393 million were cows.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 455 and 456 together.</P>
        <P>All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for <Col N="1557"/>this assessment directly.  Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s Website.  The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.</P>
        <P>NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them.  Also, in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for Reasonable Accommodation in Certificate Examinations and responds to queries in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.  NEPS also provides a service to children with visual impairment irrespective of the schools which they attend.</P>
        <P>All schools in South Tipperary identified as disadvantaged under the DEIS policy of my Department are in direct receipt of service from NEPS.  The principal of the school to which the Deputy refers may contact NEPS and advice will be given in regard to the prioritisation of students for assessment under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments.</P>

	<P>The Report of a working group to examine potential problems caused by the weight of schoolbags, which was presented in July, 1998, acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level.  One of the main recommendations of the report related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my Department initiated an awareness-raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>A further circular was issued in 2005, again highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem.  It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</P>
        <P>My Department is aware that positive action has been taken by many schools.  Actions taken by some schools consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers, the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</P>
        <P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level.  Decisions on which books to use are taken at school level.</P><Col N="1559"/>
        <P>The report of the Working Group was disseminated by the Department to the Irish Educational Publishers Association, and they were asked to include consideration of the weight of school texts in their deliberations and liaise with teachers on finding solutions to the problem.  It should be pointed out that the Report did highlight that both teachers and pupils favoured the use of multi-level textbook production for ease of convenience and ease of access and cited a high demand for them.</P>

	<P>The Third Level Student Support Schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration (pursued in a university or a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds) in other EU Member States with effect from the 1996/97 academic year.

	<P>The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf <Col N="1561"/>of the Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, was requested to explore the possibility of acquiring a site for the school in question.  Following an advertisement seeking proposals in relation to possible sites a number of responses were received.  Six sites have been visited and their technical suitability as a location for the school was considered.</P>
        <P>Following this process, a site on the existing Tipperary Rural and Business Institute (TRBDI) campus emerged as the preferred option.  This site is in the ownership of the Institute.</P>
        <P>The TRBDI, however, has proposed to the Department that its campus be relocated to a large-scale technology park.  Expressions of Interest were sought by TRBDI from the private sector to determine what exactly could be provided at the technology park in exchange for the Institute&rsquo;s current property in Clonmel.  The Expressions of Interest sought required the incorporation of a suitable site for the school on the current campus or on an alternative site approved by the Department and the Office of Public Works.  The Expressions of Interest received by TRBDI are currently being evaluated.</P>
        <P>I want to assure the Deputy again that the permanent accommodation needs of this school are being addressed and the provision of a permanent building for the school will be progressed in the context of the School Buildings and Modernisation Programme when a suitable site has been acquired.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 474 and 483 together.</P>
        <P>I assume the Deputies are referring to Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP.  Deputies will be aware, given the distinctive structure of the Irish economy and specifically, the comparatively high proportion of our GDP that is expatriated as profits of foreign direct investment enterprises, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is not a good indicator of the relative resources available in the case of Ireland.  For example, the difference in magnitude between Ireland&rsquo;s GDP and Gross National Income (GNI) was 18% in 2003.  This means that standardised expenditure data for Ireland would be higher if GNI (or GNP) were used instead of GDP.  For most OECD countries, however, the difference between GDP and GNI is negligible and the vast majority of other countries are quite happy to continue using GDP to standardise <Col N="1564"/>international data on expenditure.  Department of Education and Science expenditure on education in Ireland in 2003, the reference year used in the latest &rsquo;Education at a Glance&rsquo; report, represented 4.9% of Gross National Income.  This increased to 5.2% in 2005.</P>
        <P>The Deputies should also note that spending by my Department on second level education increased by 17% between 2003 and 2005.  In 2005 &euro;2.7 billion was spent on second-level education &mdash; up from &euro;2.3 billion in 2003 and &euro;1.25 billion in 1997.  These increases have allowed for major progress to be made both in the staffing and in the day-to-day funding of our schools.</P>
        <P>With regard to staffing, it should be noted that there is now one teacher for every 13 students at second level.</P>
        <P>Day to day funding for our schools has also increased significantly in recent years.  Since the financial year referred to in the OECD report &mdash; 2003 &mdash; second-level schools have benefited from substantial increases in funding.  The standard capitation grant of &euro;266 per pupil in 2003 now stands at &euro;298 per pupil from 1 January last.  In addition, the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from &euro;127 per pupil in 2003 to &euro;159 per pupil from January last.  This per capita grant is in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some &euro;15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>This Government has dramatically increased investment in education in recent years.  However, it is simplistic to just say that increasing spending will result in better outcomes as evidenced by the relatively poor educational outcomes of some high spending countries.  What we all wish to see is the resources targeted towards education being used to best advantage at all levels.</P>

	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs including children with visual impairment.  The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
        <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved.  Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support.  In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response.  Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios.  Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision.  The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005.  The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.</P>
        <P>The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.  The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following: deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours; processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the Council, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome.  It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the <Col N="1568"/>school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs.  This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally.  My Department also provides a Visiting Teacher service to support the needs of blind and visually impaired students in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Visiting Teachers provide assistance in the educational planning and monitoring of educational progress of pupils.  They provide a link between home and school and play a part in the successful transition from primary through to secondary level schooling.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has confirmed that the pupil to whom the Deputy refers has been granted 3 hours additional teaching support per week and has shared access to a full time Special Needs Assistant for the 2006/07 school year.  The NCSE has also advised that an application for assistive technology in the form of a laptop with specialised software has also been approved for this pupil.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs.  I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs (SEN) supports from primary and post primary schools.  The teaching and special needs assistant (SNA) support allocated are intended to enable schools to meet the needs of pupils as outlined in psychological and other professional reports.  In allocating SEN supports for individual pupils, the SENOs examine the teaching and other resources available within the individual schools.  The <Col N="1569"/>SENO also operates within the parameters of my Department&rsquo;s criteria for the allocation of such resources.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that the school in question has been allocated 3.5 hours resource teaching per week together with full time SNA support for this pupil.  My officials have been advised that the SENO received an application for an increase in resource teaching hours to 5 hours per week in respect of the pupil.  I understand that the application was refused in May 2006 because relevant documentation including professional reports were not received.</P>
        <P>The NCSE will review decisions previously taken in relation to such cases on foot of a request from the school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information that may not have been available at the time of the decision.  The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05, which has issued to all primary schools.  I am informed that the local SENO has been in contact with the school principal recently regarding the matter and will review the position on receipt of relevant documentation.</P>

The scheme does not provide for the linking of <Col N="1570"/>the grants to any particular pay scale and is flexible by nature, giving Boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.  The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school.  The standard rate of grant was increased from &euro;133 per pupil in 2005 to &euro;139 per pupil in 2006.  The level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial and caretaking services as resources permit.  It is a matter for each individual school, to decide how best to apply the funding to suit a school&rsquo;s particular needs.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to change the basis on which the Ancillary Services Grant is paid.  However, the question of increasing the rate of grant in the future will be considered in the context of available resources and priorities within the education sector.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the significant initiative for allocating resource teachers that I introduced in primary schools in September 2005 to ensure that schools have the teaching resources in place to provide support teaching for all pupils with high-incidence special educational needs, including dyslexia, who may enrol in their school.  My Department also provides funding to the Dyslexia Association to facilitate the operation of dyslexia workshops.  This funding helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public.  In addition, part of the funding assists in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association. </P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has developed an information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom, DVD and video format, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  This product has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools.  The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom.  My Department will continue to prioritise educational provision <Col N="1571"/>for children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia.</P>

	<P>I understand that the student referred to by the Deputy pursued a secretarial course in 1999, but did not complete the course, and now hopes to return to a Beauty Therapy course at the same level.  Clause 6.3.6 of the 2006 PLC Scheme states: </P>
        <P LI="1">Grants may not be paid in respect of a second period of attendance at the same level for a course approved for the purposes of this scheme, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  The Vocational Education Committee will have discretion to waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as certified serious illness.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Therefore as the student referred to by the Deputy hopes to pursue a course in 2006 of the same level she  pursued in 1999 she is not eligible to be assessed under the terms of the PLC Scheme in respect of her intended course.  Generally speaking students are eligible to be considered for grant assistance in respect of only one PLC Course.  Clause 3.2 of the PLC Scheme sets out the circumstances under which grant assistance may be awarded in respect of subsequent study at PLC Level &mdash; i.e where a candidate already holds a qualification no higher than Fetac Level 5  and are now pursuing a course that offers progression he or she may be deemed eligible for grant aid.  It is not open to me, or to my Department, to depart from the terms of the schemes in individual cases.</P>

	<P>One of the main objects of the School Transport Scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending <Col N="1572"/>regularly.  Bus &Eacute;ireann are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the School Transport scheme, including route planning.  Routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 2.4 kilometres to travel to a pick-up-point.  Home pick-ups were never envisaged as part of the Primary School Transport Scheme.</P>
        <P>The pupils from the area referred to in the details supplied reside between 0.5 and 2.1 kilometres from the pick-up point.  This is considered to be a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme.  As the families are eligible for school transport to the school referred to in the details supplied, they should make enquiries at their local Bus &Eacute;ireann Office regarding the cost of an extension of the service and the conditions attached to the provision of a pick-up-point nearer to their homes.</P>

	<P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule.  This staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year is outlined in Primary Circular 0023/2006 which was issued to all primary schools.  Based on an enrolment of 5 pupils on the 30th September 2005, as submitted by the Board of Management, the staffing for the 2006/2007 school year will be a Principal.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent Appeal Board is now in place to decide on any staffing appeals.  The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department Primary Circular 0024/2006.  The staffing of the school for the 2006/2007 school year was considered by the Appeal Board on 25th May, 2006.  The Board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in Circular 0024/2006, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case.  The Board of Management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the Appeal Board on 26th May, 2006.</P>

	<P>Since the establishment of my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) in 1999, the number of psychologists in the NEPS has increased from 43 to 123 at present.  The Public Appointments Service completed a recruitment competition for the appointment of Educational Psychologists to NEPS last year.  Regional panels have been established to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need.  To date, my Department has appointed seven (7) new psychologists, 4 of whom have been appointed to the Mid West region, two (2) to the Eastern region (south west area) and one (1) to the South East region.  Four (4) psychologists have been assigned to the newly established National Behaviour Support Service and these four psychologists will be replaced by four additional appointments from the panel of the last competition.  It is expected that additional psychologists will be appointed in the coming months.</P>
        <P>All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS and full details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  In addition, NEPS provides a service to every school in the event of a critical incident regardless of whether the school already has a dedicated service from a NEPS psychologist.  Also in <Col N="1575"/>relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for Reasonable Accommodations in Certificate Examinations and responds to queries and requests for assessments in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.</P>

	<P>Section 23 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 provides that the National Council for Special Education must make a report to the Minister outlining the steps that must be taken in order that the provisions of the 2004 Act will be fully implemented within the period specified in the report.  While there is a high degree of consistency and complementarity between the Special Needs Act and Part 2 of the Disability Act, and the Council is conferred with functions under both Acts, the report is required only to refer to the implementation of the 2004 Act.</P>
        <P>The National Council has completed its deliberations and I have asked my officials to examine <Col N="1578"/>the report&rsquo;s recommendations and to work in close co-operation with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Services Executive in implementing the remaining provisions of the two Acts.</P>

	<P>The conditions, under which the Defence Forces may participate on overseas peace support operations have been made very clear by the Government. In this regard, the conditions, which have been referred to as the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo;, must be satisfied, i.e.,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the operation must be authorized/mandated by the United Nations;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Requests from the UN for Irish participation in new missions are dealt with under the United Nations Stand-by Arrangement System  (UNSAS) on a case-by-case basis.  The factors which inform the Government&rsquo;s consideration of each such request include the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An assessment of whether a peacekeeping operation is the most appropriate response</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The degree of risk involved.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The extent to which the required skills or characteristics relate to Irish capabilities.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Whether the operation is adequately resourced.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The level of existing commitments to peacekeeping operations and security requirements at home.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">While there are risks attaching to any peacekeeping operation, a key aspect and the primary concern in relation to participation in any mission is the safety and security of Defence Forces personnel.  For this reason, a detailed reconnaissance and risk assessment is undertaken prior to the deployment of a contingent and the results are considered and evaluated prior to a final decision to deploy.</P><Col N="1579"/>
        <P>On 30 August, 2006, the Government approved the despatch of members of the Defence Forces on a fact-finding and reconnaissance missions in connection with the Defence Forces possible participation in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which was originally established in March 1978.  Following the July/August 2006 crisis, the UN Security Council extended the mandate of UNIFIL to the end of August 2007 under UN Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) of 11 August, 2006.</P>
        <P>There have been in-depth discussions between the Defence Forces and their Finnish counterparts, including a joint reconnaissance to Lebanon, concerning the possible deployment to UNIFIL of Irish personnel as part of a joint Finnish-Irish unit, the details of which unit are still being worked out.</P>

	<P>In general, planning permission must be sought for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast.  In July 1996 my Department issued Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures.  Their purpose was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines advise that &ldquo;in the vicinity of larger towns and city suburbs operators should endeavour to locate in industrial areas or in industrially zoned land&rdquo;.  They advise that &ldquo;only as a last resort should free-standing masts be located within or in the immediate surrounds of smaller towns or villages&rdquo; and also that &ldquo;only as a last resort should free standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools&rdquo;.  Planning authorities must have regard to the Guidelines in considering applications for permission for new masts in their areas.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 set out certain limited exemptions for telecommunications infrastructure and equipment.  These include subject to certain conditions, the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structures, the replacement of an existing antenna support structure and the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as telegraph poles, electricity pylons and cer<Col N="1580"/>tain public or commercial buildings.  These exemptions specifically exclude attaching antennae to existing structures such as educational facilities, childcare facilities and hospitals.  These Regulations were the subject of extensive debate in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government, and were subsequently approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a matter for each local authority to ensure that developments permitted in their area conform to these standards.</P>
        <P>Following the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources Report on Non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts of June 2005, an inter-departmental advisory committee and an expert group, working to the committee, has been established to provide advice on the appropriate action to be taken on foot of the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Committee report.  The work of the committee and expert group is in train and I expect it to be finalised by the end of 2006, following which appropriate action will be addressed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 510 and 511 together.</P><Col N="1582"/>
        <P>The EU Civil Protection Mechanism provides for interventions both inside and outside the European Union following a request for assistance (personnel, equipment and/or supplies) from a country where the domestic emergency services are unable to cope in the aftermath of a major natural or man-made disaster.  Under the Mechanism, when a request for assistance is received at the EU Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), this request is transmitted to all of the participating states and offers of assistance are co-ordinated by the MIC and relayed to the requesting country.  The requesting country then decides which offers (or elements of offers) to accept.</P>
        <P>Ireland participates fully in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.  When a request for assistance is received by my Department from the MIC, it is examined in consultation with other Government Departments and relevant agencies and a decision is made on whether an offer of assistance can be made.  Participation in the Mechanism following a request for assistance is voluntary and does not involve any prior commitment, financial or otherwise.</P>
        <P>Ireland is committed to relevant training programmes, exercises and expert exchanges in the field of Civil Protection.  Eight Irish nominees have undertaken civil protection training courses to date.  The courses in question are the Community Mechanism Induction Course, the Operational Management Course and the High Level Co-ordination Course.  These training courses are essentially directed at team leaders and incident assessors.</P>
        <P>The Leonardo da Vinci II programme is the EU&rsquo;s Vocational Training Programme; it has no direct relevance to the operation of the Civil Protection Mechanism.  My Department has not applied for funding under this programme.</P>

	<P>There are no specific grants available from my Department for the building of granny flats onto family homes.  There are, however, a number of schemes available, which <Col N="1584"/>are intended to assist with works, which provide additional or adapted accommodation in private houses.</P>
        <P>The Disabled Persons Grant, which is administered by the local authorities, is available for the provision of additional accommodation or the carrying out of works of adaptation, which are necessary to make a house more suitable for a disabled member of the household.  The scheme is increasingly used to address the age related mobility issues of older persons.  The types of work allowable under the scheme are the provision of access ramps, downstairs toilet facilities, stairlifts, accessible showers, adaptations to facilitate wheelchair access, extensions etc.</P>
        <P>The essential repairs grant, which is administered by the local authorities, enables people in houses, which cannot be made habitable in all respects at a reasonable cost, to have basic repairs carried out to them.  The scheme is directed primarily at older persons and is intended to facilitate having those conditions improved sufficiently to allow them to remain in their homes for their lifetime and to avoid having to move to a different area or to be rehoused by the local authority.</P>
        <P>The Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme operates under the aegis of my Department and is administered by Health Service Executives.  Aid is available under the scheme for necessary repairs to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant.  Works generally extend to the repair or replacement of external doors and windows, gutters, replacement of missing or loose roof tiles, dry lining/damp proofing of rooms, such as a bedroom or living room persistently in use, replacement of defective electrical wiring, repair of fireplaces and, where required, the provision of presses or shelves for the storing of food or clothing.  A suitable form of heating may also be installed e.g. storage heating.</P>
        <P>The Improvement Works in Lieu Scheme enables local authorities to improve or extend a privately owned house, which is or will be occupied by persons in need of local authority housing.  The types of works allowable are the elimination of defects and the provision of additional accommodation to eliminate overcrowding or to accommodate a person not residing in the house who is approved for local authority housing.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  This arrangement operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of this year.  This service is free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.  </P>
        <P>The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites.  A significant finding from the pilot scheme is that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it is necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I have recently announced that collections of waste silage-bale wrap will now be put in place by Leitrim, Roscommon, Carlow, Longford, North Tipperary and Wicklow County Councils.  Announcements regarding further extensions of collections to other areas, including Kerry, will follow completion of collections in those counties taking part in the second phase of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The local authority collections are being put in place on a once off basis to remove accumulated silage bale wrap and sheeting from farms.  Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers &mdash; i.e. manufacturers and importers &mdash; of farm plastics (silage bale wrap and sheeting) are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the waste in question.  The Irish Farm Film Producers Group (IFFPG) is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.</P>
        <P>Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the <Col N="1586"/>collection and recovery of farm plastics waste.  In spite of the successful operation of the scheme in recent years, it became apparent this year that the Scheme lacked sufficient resources to satisfy the demand that existed for collections of farm plastics.  Therefore, following discussions with the IFFPG, farming organisations and local authorities, last May I announced amendments to the scheme to support improved services to farmers.  Under the new arrangements, the scheme is being funded by a combination of the existing levies paid by the producer members of IFFPG who run the scheme and funding from weight based collection charges to be paid by farmers availing of the service.  This will improve the operational efficiency of the scheme by incentivising the presentation of clean, dry plastic by farmers.  IFFPG estimate that a typical farmer will incur a cost of &euro;50 every second year arising from the introduction of this charge.  The effect of the introduction of a charge will be to ensure that supply of collections of farm plastics to farmers can match the demand on an ongoing basis.  Collections of film plastic and silage wrap are currently being provided nationwide by the (IFFPG) on this basis.</P>

	<P>It is understood that Dublin City Council are finalising a strategy to be completed early in 2007 to replace their senior citizen bed-sit accommodation with separate bedroom(s) and living areas. Following the completion of this report it is the intention of the City Council to make a submission to my Department requesting capital funding to undertake this programme.  My <Col N="1587"/>Department&rsquo;s current Social Housing Design Guidelines indicate that local authorities should provide dwellings with separate bedroom(s) and living areas in all instances. </P>

	<P>Local authorities have been encouraged to accelerate progress on the implementation of their housing programmes in order to provide as many social housing units as possible to meet housing need.  This includes the acquisition of dwellings to meet their housing targets as set out in their Housing Action Plans.

        <P>A total of 918 dwellings were acquired by local authorities in 2005.  In this period, Sligo County and Borough Councils acquired 8 and 20 dwellings respectively.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 524 and 530 together.</P>
        <P>In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority.  It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register and to review progress in this regard as appropriate.  Local authorities must publish the draft Register on or before 1 November each year and they must publish the final Register on 1 February.</P>
        <P>In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register, which included the use of Census enumerators or other temporary personnel to support local authorities in preparing the next Register.  The CSO contacted census enumerators seeking expressions of interest in the work; lists of enumerators expressing such an interest in each city and county council area were made available to local authorities.  This cleared the way for recruitment and deployment, as appropriate, by local authorities of additional temporary staff for the registration campaign.</P><Col N="1590"/>
        <P>In addition, my Department worked with a group of local authority managers and senior officials to put in place an enhanced programme for improving the next Register.  Detailed procedures for the carrying out of registration fieldwork were finalised and issued to local authorities in early July.  The procedures include provision for ensuring that each household is visited and provided with forms and information at least twice, if necessary.  In the event that this process does not satisfactorily register the household,  written notification would then be given cautioning of the danger of being omitted from the Register.  A person not on the draft register when published on 1 November may apply (before 25 November) for inclusion on the final register to be published on 1 February 2007 or may apply for inclusion on the supplement to the register which closes on the fifteenth day before the next polling day.</P>
        <P>New supplies of the electoral registration (RFA) forms were distributed to all local authorities in June (significantly earlier than in previous years).  I also committed to providing additional ring-fenced financial resources to support local authorities&rsquo; own spending in respect of the register campaign and have advised authorities that a contribution of some &euro;6 million can be made available in this regard.  An initial allocation of some &euro;3 million, based on the number of households in each local authority area, was made available in July to local authorities for registration work; details of allocations are set out in the table below.</P>
        <P>As regards publicity and awareness, a two-stage approach has been developed, involving information notices followed by an intensive media campaign.  Information notices were published in the national press on 19-21 August, urging co-operation with local register campaigns.  In addition, a national publicity and awareness campaign involving TV, radio, press and outdoor advertising commenced on 11 September and will run until 25 November (the closing date for submitting corrections to the Draft Register).  An on-line register search facility is now available through local authority websites.  A link from my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.environ.ie</i>) to the relevant search facility has also been provided.</P>
        <P>New arrangements for the deletion of names of deceased persons from the Register are now in place: the new system allows for the efficient and timely deletion of the names of deceased persons from the Register using the Death Event Publication Service which has been developed by Reach in association with the General Register Office.</P>
        <P>New guidance for local authorities on Preparing and Maintaining the Register of Electors was made available to authorities in electronic format on 31 May.  Printed copies of the guidance were <Col N="1591"/>subsequently sent to all local authorities, returning officers and relevant Government Departments.  In the final version of the guidance, the importance of local authorities cross-checking the Register with other databases available to them is stressed.  The measures I announced in April are important supports for action by local authorities to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register in their areas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 528, 529 and 531 together.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Electronic Voting concluded in its Second Report on the Secrecy, Accuracy and Testing of the Chosen Electronic Voting System, which was published on 4 July 2006, that it can recommend the voting and counting equipment for use at elections in Ireland, subject to further work it has recommended.  The Commission made it clear that many of its recommendations involve only relatively minor modifications or additions to the system.  While the software of the voting machine was considered by the Commission to be of adequate quality requiring only minor modifications and further analysis to confirm its reliability, it was unable to recommend the election management software.  In the context of its comparison of the electronic and manual voting systems, the Commission concluded that, subject to its recommendations being implemented, the chosen system has the potential to deliver greater accuracy than the paper system and can provide similarly high levels of secrecy.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s priority in the preparations for the national roll-out of the system for the June 2004 polls was to confirm that the system functioned effectively and that staff were trained in their duties and responsibilities.  While it is acknowledged that additional measures can be taken to strengthen further the security protocols surrounding the system, provide more fully docu<Col N="1594"/>mented procedures and otherwise enhance the system, the fundamental operability, accuracy and functionality of the system, and its effective operation, are not in doubt.</P>
        <P>In response to the report, the Government has established a Cabinet Committee, which I chair and which includes the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to consider the report and other assessment work in detail; report to the Government on the full implications of the Commission recommendations; consider the composition of a peer review group (drawn from international electoral reform bodies and the IT industry) to supervise any software redesign work; report to the Government on confidence building measures; and identify any other improvements that might be built into the system.  The work of the Cabinet Committee is underway.</P>

	<P>Comprehensive guidelines to assist local authorities in the implementation of Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 have issued on a number of occasions by my Department since December, 2000.  These Guidelines are currently available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i> and may be purchased from the Government Publications Sales Office.</P>
        <P>The most recent advice in this matter involved five regional seminars which offered local authority officials an opportunity to discuss their experiences to date of the implementation of Part V.  The seminars were structured around a Part V Resource Pack prepared by the Affordable Homes Partnership in collaboration with the Department.  My Department constantly monitors the operation of Part V and will continue to advise local authorities on issues affecting implementation.  I am satisfied that local authorities are implementing Part V as it was intended.</P>

	<P>The review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme, which incorporates the conditions governing the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme was recently finalised within my Department.  The aim of the review has been to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need of such assistance, to streamline as far as possible the procedures governing the operation of the grant scheme, and to introduce a level of consistency in operation across local authorities. </P>
        <P>Proposals for the future operation of the schemes are now being prepared by my Department, in consultation with other public agencies <Col N="1596"/>concerned, and I expect to be in a position to announce these shortly.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A key objective of the Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan is to encourage and facilitate access to appropriate housing and accommodation for persons with disabilities.  The commitment given in relation to the Disabled Person&rsquo;s Grant scheme is that the reform of the scheme will be completed in 2006;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The review has been completed within the Department and proposals for the future operation of the schemes are currently under consideration.  A working group comprising representatives of the Department of Health &amp; Children, the HSE, and local authorities has been convened and will focus on finalising the relevant aspects of the amended schemes in a short space of time.  It is expected that the proposals for the future operation of the schemes will be ready to be announced shortly.</P>
