      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past months, Opposition parties warned the Government of the danger of innocent people being gunned down on the streets because of the increase in internal gangland warfare, principally over drugs and money.  This has now happened, unfortunately, in a number of tragic cases from Donna Cleary to Anthony Campbell and Alan Cunniffe, with another death in County Louth occurring this morning, apparently linked to a spate of car hijackings.</P>
        <P>The Government was warned by the Opposition parties that it was not doing enough to meet this scourge head-on when there is evidence of people driving on the M50 with flak jackets firing machine guns across lanes, innocent people being gunned down and people being assassinated in broad daylight.  It is time for the Government to get serious about this extremely serious problem.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach consistently told us he received security briefings in recent months and pointed out that Mr. Hyland&rsquo;s name came up in all of them.  If that is the case, and the Taoiseach has been briefed about this, why did the Government not grant sufficient resources or <i>imprimatur</i> to the garda&iacute; and the CAB to place these people under surveillance?  Why was the CAB not in a position to follow the money trail to its conclusion?  How can shipments of drugs be ordered by mobile phone from prison?  Why, after ten years of knowledge of the activities of the assassinated Mr. Hyland, were he and his fellow drugs barons not put out of business when children lie orphaned as a consequence of their actions?</P>
        <P>In the Taoiseach&rsquo;s briefings, was he given information by the garda&iacute; or the Army that Mr. Hyland, the assassinated drug baron, was directly involved in the recent murder of the Latvian woman, Baiba Saulite, who left two young children behind?  Did the briefing include evidence this person was directly linked to that murder?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, I sympathise with the families of all of those killed in recent times, in Kilkenny last week, Dublin yesterday and as a result of the overnight gang activity on the Border.</P>
        <P>In reply to Deputy Kenny, the Government has at all times given the garda&iacute; full resources and statutory powers to deal with this issue, particularly the gang warfare that has been going on since the summer of 2005.  Most of the 23 who have died this year and the 21 who died last year were victims of gun crimes directly related to a web of gangs that operate in the city and county and some of the surrounding counties.</P>
        <P>Just over a year ago, based on intelligence, the Garda told the Government it was setting up Operation Anvil.  The Garda Commissioner augmented the organised crime unit, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, with an additional 55 garda&iacute; to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the unit has resulted in firearms being seized and people being arrested, disrupting their criminal activity.  There has also been an increase in Garda monitoring and targeting of individuals and groups involved in armed crime.  We have also strengthened our legislation, with ten year sentences for people caught in possession of a moderate amount of drugs at today&rsquo;s going rates.  The garda&iacute; have operated these systems.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny will appreciate that I cannot give a full account of security briefings but the nucleus is that the gangs are operating against each other in severe conflict and most of the issues I have mentioned are related to that fact.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To deal with that, the garda&iacute; had quietly and effectively established Operation Oak, named after the location where these gangs operate &mdash; people in the district would know from where the name comes.  Arising from that, the garda&iacute; have achieved 40 arrests.  The operation was based around the late Martin Hyland and, as a result, many criminal elements were arrested and there were more than 20 large seizures of guns and drugs.  The garda&iacute; and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave the figures yesterday &mdash; they recovered 30 kg of heroin, 35 kg of cocaine, 1,500 kg of cannabis, stolen vehicles, handguns, AK-47s, sawn-off shotguns, rifles, ammunition and cash as a result of that operation.</P>
        <P>Some of the work in that operation led to reports in the national press about the attempted kidnapping of a person and further seizures of drugs on a farm in Meath.  All these operations centred on that.  The Garda found that because it had closed in on this gang, death threats were being made against Martin Hyland.  Even though the Garda was closely watching him, it had to inform him he was being threatened in the interest of natural justice.  The Garda knew some of the people threatening him because of its own successful operation when one examines the full briefing of the force&rsquo;s break up of this gang. <Col N="1115"/> However, that creates its own problems and difficulties relating to the gang.  The Garda has appointed its top assistant commissioner, who has been very effective on gangland crime, to take charge of this.  The T&aacute;naiste told the garda&iacute; more than 18 months ago that resources are not an issue, but significant resources are taken up, including the use of the best detectives in the force.  They have to provide 24-hour cover.</P>
        <P>The obvious question is if so many garda&iacute; were watching Martin Hyland, how did others get him but he was moving around because he knew he was a target.  When one looks at the security briefing, it highlights a sophisticated web of activity involving a number of gangs who cross each other.  The Garda is doing its utmost within the powers of the law and in the context of human rights.</P>
        <P>Garda&iacute; know the key players but it must play by the legal system.  Martin Hyland was known for a long time but he was good at dodging Garda surveillance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>No human rights were extended to Anthony Campbell yesterday, unfortunately.  The public perception of the way the Government parties have acted on this issue is that they have either lost the bottle to do the business or they are not giving this sophisticated unit of the Garda sufficient impetus to do its job.  Nobody can understand after ten years the failure to put away this drug baron, who was assassinated, and others.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, as an advocate of zero tolerance, would have been completely apoplectic about a hell of a lot less than this.  However, fewer of these crimes are being detected and no drug baron has been put behind bars over the past five years.  If Government members know who these people are on the basis of the briefings they are given, why is it not possible for the security forces of this country to have Government backing to implement its primary responsibility to keep our citizens safe?  Innocent people are being mown down as a result of internal gangland feuds involving drugs and greed.  The Government&rsquo;s operations are not working.  What new measures does the Taoiseach intend to take to ensure they work?</P>
        <P>The question I asked earlier related to Baiba Saulite.  Did the information given to the Taoiseach in briefings indicate whether Mr. &ldquo;Marlo&rdquo; Hyland was directly involved in her murder?  It has been brought to my attention that the late Mr. Hyland was paying serious protection money to the Provisional IRA because of internal gangland feuds.  Can the Taoiseach confirm, on the basis of evidence given to him through briefings by Army or Garda personnel, that the Provisional IRA was involved in the murder of Mr. Hyland or was associated with him in that respect?  According to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, that outfit is supposed to be <Col N="1116"/>extinct and not involved in further criminality.  Do the Taoiseach&rsquo;s briefings extend to information that the Provisional IRA was in receipt of protection money from the late Mr. Hyland and may have been involved in his murder?</P>

	<P>In fairness to the Garda, the Government and the House have done their job in legislative terms.  The Garda has been told by the T&aacute;naiste over the past 18 months that there is no difficulty or question about resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>That is untrue.</P>

	<P>That is rubbish.  That is not true.  That is not what the Garda is saying.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan should note it is his leader&rsquo;s question.  He is entitled to hear the answer and he should afford him the courtesy of hearing the answer.</P>

	<P>We want an answer, not bluster.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>What else would he say?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that, as a result of the Garda operation, the net was tightening around Martin Hyland and he was losing his grip on his criminal activities.  A total of 43 of his associates have been arrested.  It is not true for Deputy Kenny to say the Garda has not been successful.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no conviction in five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is also untrue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Two dozen of them have been charged.  The Deputy should not come into the House without the facts.  A total of 43 have been arrested and 24 have been charged with serious offences within a year.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1117"/>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about convictions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on intelligence and criminal operations, &euro;23 million worth of drugs and property have been confiscated.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Latvian woman in Swords, I have no evidence of that.  All I have heard is rumours but it is well known that the gun operation in Dublin and beyond was closely associated with Martin Hyland.  The Deputy can work out the rest.</P>
        <P>I have seen nothing that implicates anyone in the Provisional IRA.  Deputy Kenny will be aware that the name, Operation Oak, is based on a location in my constituency.  The recent abduction took place close to where I am.  A significant former paramilitary was in the company of Martin Hyland over the summer, but the person is not associated with the Provisional IRA nor has he been.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Gun rules okay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should be serious about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Durkan to allow Deputy Rabbitte to proceed without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children put through the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill 2006, which permits nursing homes to cause clients to sell their family home.  He said he had no flexibility on this and he was doing so on the instruction of the Cabinet and on the advice of the Attorney General.  There is now statutory underpinning to force the sale of the family home if one&rsquo;s parent is in a nursing home.  Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children announced a new scheme, which provides for a charge to be levied against the family home.  It is not clear whether the senior and junior Ministers are <i>ad idem </i>on this or whether the junior Minister was being hanged out to dry or where we stand, but there is no clarity about it.</P>
        <P>The scheme the Minister announced contains a number of fundamental changes.  For example, nobody can be referred to a nursing home unless he or she has been medically assessed.  In the normal course of events, having been medically assessed, one can be referred to an acute hospital or a nursing home.  If one is referred to an acute hospital, there is no facility to compel the sale of the family home or to make a charge against it, but there is if one is referred to a nursing home.  Why is the family home only included for the purposes of the means test because a person is old?  Will the Taoiseach explain to the House why such a distinction is made between one type of medical institution and another?  One may not enter a nursing home until one has been medically assessed, so what happens to the rest of our older <Col N="1118"/>people?  Are they left alone to bear the entire cost of private residential care or will the Taoiseach tell me they will be eligible for home care packages?  What home care packages will these people be eligible for and where are they?</P>
        <P>In terms of the charge that can be levied, where does the carer left in the family home stand while the person being cared for is in a nursing home?  What is to stop people transferring assets when so advised?  Why should a person, because he or she is old, live in fear of remortgaging or selling his or her house?  Why did the Government enact a law last week permitting the sale of the family home if it is not the intention to resort to that law at some stage?  Some of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s backbenchers do not have time to follow every piece of legislation that passes through the House and the legacy being left by the Progressive Democrats is only beginning to dawn on them.  The Taoiseach should now perform the sort of U-turn he has done on a number of issues recently, before old people are caused greater anxiety by the situation the Government has created.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not need to debate last week&rsquo;s legislation but the arrangements enacted in this case to support nursing home residents have been in place since 1993.  Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s colleagues pointed out at the time the legislation was going through that it was deeply unfair.  People with the same means and care needs can face greatly different costs in public and private homes and the Government decided a new, fairer deal should be created.  It will take a year for this initiative to put that in place but the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, outlined the scheme on Monday.</P>
        <P>In accordance with Towards 2016, the plan will ensure the same level of support for public and private nursing home residents and will involve co-payments between care recipients and the State.  It will ensure that care is affordable for all, which is not the case at present as some people are forced to remortgage and sell their homes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will be putting sons and daughters out on the street.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputies to be silent and allow the Taoiseach to speak.  Deputy Rabbitte was entitled to two minutes speaking time and had four and a half minutes to submit his question.  The Taoiseach is entitled to be heard in silence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was asked approximately 20 questions.  I merely mentioned that Deputy Howlin, as Minister, introduced this scheme and sought to point out its unfair elements.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Who was Minister for Finance at that time?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1119"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Stagg to be silent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This plan will ensure that care is affordable for all and that nobody will be forced to sell or remortgage his or her home to pay for care, which is not the case at present.  A major change is that, in future, when a person makes his or her contribution the State will meet the balance of costs and take the risks associated with price increases.  The scheme will be transparent with the same standardised means of assessment of need and individual contributions will be based on income and assets.  The individual will be expected to contribute 80% of disposable income at the time of receipt of care.  Most old people have modest incomes and the average income of a person over 65 years of age in 2006 has been calculated to be &euro;234 per week.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte said this will apply only to old people going to nursing homes but, at present, it does not relate to age and would be the same for a person below 65 years of age.  A deferred charge of up to 5% of residential costs will apply.  At present, many people applying for subvention must produce 5% of the value of their houses in cash for an indefinite period of care.  This is very unfair, causes great distress and makes it an almost impossible target for people to meet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Taoiseach could take the roofs from their houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the new system no cash based on a house&rsquo;s value will be required in the lifetime of the individual.  The charge will be limited and will be deferred until a settlement is reached regarding an estate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>What about sons and daughters in the house?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the interruptions I am trying to answer Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s questions.  Nursing homes will be approved based on quality <Col N="1120"/>and price and a medical assessment will apply, the operation of which the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has outlined.</P>
        <P>Regarding quality standards, the homes must be registered and satisfy inspections carried out as we have had a number of debates in this House during this session on the importance of assessment and inspections.</P>
        <P>A new residential care unit within the National Treatment Purchase Fund will be established and will negotiate fixed prices with private nursing homes bringing stability in the area.  Legislation will be required on this next year and Members will have plenty of time to give their points of view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, said recently that there will be a consultation process.  Importantly, the basic rate of subvention for 2007 will be increased to &euro;300 per week, which will cost an extra &euro;85 million overall.  </P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked where the home care packages are and we have announced residential care funding of more than &euro;400 million for day care and home care packages for this year and next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not true to say that this applies to this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are putting a great deal of resources into that scheme.  Last week&rsquo;s budget included 2,000 home care packages and the full year cost of this is &euro;55 million.  An additional 780 hours of home care services at a cost of &euro;18 million has been provided for and many additional people will work under these home care packages.  </P>

	<P>Deputy Rabbitte asked how many additional people will be employed in services for the elderly next year and this figure will be just short of 1,000.  There will be &euro;120 million for services for old people and a further &euro;50 million the following year, giving a total cost of &euro;170 million.  I can see nobody on the Opposition bench is interested in what we do for the elderly.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach says it is wrong that, at present, people may be forced to remortgage or sell the family home.  That is exactly what the Government is providing for with the action it has taken.

	<P>The situation is clear in terms of the price that will now be paid for the scheme, so I will only summarise it.  With regard to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remark about the regulations introduced by Deputy Howlin when he was a Minister in 1993 in the aftermath of the gutting of the health services by the outgoing Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, the regulations introduced were consistent with the amount of money provided by the then Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance at that time was the current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  </P>

        <P LI="1">Older people, many of whom have paid their taxes for 40 years, did so in the belief they had a social contract with the State which included provision for their basic health needs.  That contract cannot now be torn up.  In many cases, older people have spent their entire savings to pay their nursing home bills and their home is their last asset.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Age Action Ireland believes that people of all ages should be treated equally by the State when it comes to health care.  If a person in their 30s or 40s were to become seriously ill, leaving them in need of nursing home care for the rest of their lives, the State would not force <Col N="1122"/>them to sell the family home.  Neither should older people in need of nursing home care.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Labour Party concurs with Age Action Ireland.  People should not be forced to remortgage or sell the family home, yet that is what the Government is doing to sons and daughters in many cases, with the result that older people are being caused needless anxiety and distress.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This is the time of year when many people, older people in particular, face the worry and distress of illness and hospitalisation.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the fears of many of these older citizens are compounded by the further fear of acquiring hospital based infections such as MRSA?  Is he aware of the concerns that exist in all communities?  Last month, I raised this issue on Leaders&rsquo; Questions and I make no apology for doing so again on this, the last opportunity for Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
        <P>We have one of the worst rates of hospital acquired infections, especially with regard to MRSA, in Europe.  I ask the Taoiseach to listen to the following statement:</P>
        <P LI="1">I would be afraid if I had to go in for an operation now, I would think twice about it.  I&rsquo;d be very afraid, not on account of the competence of the doctors and the nurses, but on account of the structure they have to work under.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are the words of a missionary priest, Fr. Brendan Forde, speaking after the funeral of his sister, Barbara, who died in Beaumont Hospital after acquiring MRSA from a routine operation.  Fr. Forde continued: &ldquo;She went in for an ordinary operation and she came out dead from a hospital-acquired infection, which we were told was MRSA&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Where is the Government&rsquo;s urgency in response to this glaring need in the hospital network?  Where is the special allocation of funding for the promised additional isolation units or to ensure single units in intensive care wards?  These are real needs and, since I last raised the issue of MRSA, the Cork City Coroner has followed the lead of the Dublin City Coroner by requiring all deaths attributable to MRSA to be reported to him.  His decision followed a landmark inquest finding, in which it was determined that a 74 year-old man died as a result of MRSA acquired at Cork University Hospital.  Will the Government now do as I urged one month ago by making it mandatory to report MRSA or other hospital acquired infections as part of the process of reporting deaths to coroners?  Will the Taoiseach explain why more people are noting, as the campaigning group MRSA and Families has said, that there is a wall of silence in respect of this entire issue throughout the health services and the political establishment?  What will the Taoiseach do <Col N="1125"/>to address this very pressing and worrying matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that this problem has arisen at this time of the year, in particular, over recent years.  This important issue has to be considered in this country and other countries.  I do not think there is a wall of silence in this regard.  At this time of year, representatives of hospitals in various parts of the country often issue statements to the national and local media, explaining that they have had to close sections of hospitals such as units and wards as a result of MRSA.</P>
        <P>The prevention and control of infections which are associated with health care is a broader issue.  The Department of Health and Children has ensured in recent years that this important issue is a priority for the Health Service Executive, which has published detailed guidelines on hygiene, including hand hygiene.  The guidelines, which set out ways of controlling MRSA in hospital and community settings, have been well-publicised over the past two years.  Anyone who has visited a hospital recently will be aware that hygiene has been stepped up throughout the health system.</P>
        <P>The HSE has recruited essential infection control staff who are dedicated to dealing with MRSA.  One could say that such staff should always have been in place, but it was deemed necessary to bring them in at a certain time, based on what was being done in countries in northern Europe, which have a better record on hospital diseases than countries in southern and western Europe.</P>
        <P>The HSE will soon publish a three-year action plan, which will set targets for the next three years.  The targets, which will be based on the HSE guidelines, will represent an attempt to reduce the level of infection in Ireland to a level that is akin to the levels found in northern Europe, where the best record in this regard is found.  The recommendations on hospital hygiene standards which were included in the strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, which was launched five years ago, are being implemented.  The recommendations relate to the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics, active surveillance, the detection of MRSA and clinical governance structures in the area of infection control.  Those who brief Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on these matters have probably told him that many of these problems result from the prescription and over-prescription of antibiotic drugs.  I do not declare myself to be an expert on these matters.  This issue has been in our system for a long time.</P>
        <P>Two hygiene audits have been carried out to date in acute hospitals under the auspices of the National Hospitals Office.  Earlier this year, in the spring or early summer, we participated in the Hospital Infection Society&rsquo;s survey on infections which are associated with health care in the UK and Ireland.  Some 75,000 patients were surveyed <Col N="1126"/>in the study.  It was recorded that approximately 10% of patients in the Republic who had infections which are associated with health care had an MRSA-related infection.  While there is no doubt that figure of 10% is very high, the figure is higher in other countries.  The survey in question found that the relevant figure in the UK is<?oasys _jy ?>16%.  The figure is far lower in northern European countries, however.  We have to deal with all the issues in the reports, including the guidelines, the infections which are associated with health care, the ongoing campaign on hygiene standards, the recommendations which have been given to hospitals, the prescription of certain drugs, the surveillance of MRSA and the clinical governance structures.</P>
        <P>Area infection controls were mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in the context of providing more clean areas, such as isolation units, for people.  All of these recommendations are in the process of being implemented, if they have not already been implemented.  The HSE&rsquo;s next step will be to benchmark its guidelines against the actions which have been taken.  It will try to reduce the figure I mentioned over the next three years.  That will be the next step in the programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The wall of silence is real.  Relatives are not being told &mdash; that is a fact.  The last time I raised this matter with the Taoiseach, I mentioned the position in the Netherlands.  The Taoiseach responded by saying that the Government would not go down that road.  It is clear that one of the stark and critical differences between the system in the Netherlands and the system here is that there are more single rooms in hospitals in the Netherlands.  Patients in that country do not have to tolerate this country&rsquo;s extent of overcrowding in absolutely inappropriate situations which leave people vulnerable to getting hospital-acquired infections, particularly MRSA.</P>
        <P>I wish to quote Fr. Brendan Forde again:</P>
        <P LI="1">You get great tax breaks if you build luxury hotels for the super-rich but they are incapable of building in our hospitals some individual units for the most vulnerable people, those who are in intensive care, and they will put them into a ward where there are hospital-acquired infections.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I referred to the death of Fr. Brendan&rsquo;s sister, Barbara.  I extend my sympathy and, I am sure, the sympathy of the House to him and his family on their tragic loss.  Many countless hundreds of lives have been lost in such a tragic manner as a result of this serious problem.  Cleanliness is hugely important and hygiene is critical.  What steps will the Taoiseach take to ensure we have single-room isolation units?  We need to have the space to deal with people who are vulnerable to infection.  When people are recovering after oper<Col N="1127"/>ations and other procedures, etc, they should not have to cope as part of a lumpen mass of patients.</P>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach to take the required steps to help to stamp out this scourge for once and for all.  Nothing in what the Minister announced last week will give any hope to families who are faced this winter with loved ones who are afraid to go to our hospitals.  It is time for action on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are people in isolation units, such as intensive care facilities, in every one of our acute hospitals.  I refer to people who have had operations in recent days, having suffered from various ailments.  That is a fact.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about isolation units and said we should have such good facilities for people with serious ailments who might be at risk of getting or spreading infections.  It is obvious that hospitals should be dealing with this issue.  It is good to have isolation facilities.  Most of our new developments have more intensive care and high-dependency beds.  The Deputy asked whether there should be more facilities of that nature.  I do not disagree with his suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no beds.  People are on trolleys rather than beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of infections which are associated with health care is an important one.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s point relates to whether we can feel comfortable about the fact that people are going into hospital with certain ailments and then picking up separate infections in hospital.  Nobody can defend that.  The Deputy asked me a fair question about what the HSE is doing about this problem.  I have said that the HSE will soon publish an action plan that will set targets on the basis of its guidelines for the control of MRSA in hospital and community settings.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm and his colleagues on the health committee have emphasised that issues like basic cleanliness, hygiene standards, the appropriate prescription of antibiotic drugs, active surveillance for the detection of MRSA, clinical governance structures and infection control standards are hugely important.  Nothing is more important to a hospital than trying to ensure there is no bacterial spreading or any other kind of spreading in the broad area of infections which are associated with health care.  This area is broader than just MRSA &mdash; there are many other infections.  There are wider issues like the strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am aware from listening to the senior members in the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive that they are acutely conscious of that aspect.  As we continue to put in the enormous amounts of resources we have been putting in for a number of years to the health capital programme, we <Col N="1128"/>must ensure that national hygiene standards as shown in national hygiene audits continue to improve.</P>
        <P>These are important issues.  I am not an expert in this area but it always amazed me, from my own days long ago when I worked in the Mater and the good Sisters of Mercy had control over it, that it would be easier to get into Fort Knox than into the hospital, with the exception of strict visiting hours.  We do not appear to have the same issues around that 30 years on.  It always puzzles me that large numbers of people go in for a long number of days.  I would have thought that is an issue.  I have raised that at other times as well but hygiene standards are vitally important and I do not disagree with the Deputy&rsquo;s urging to try to improve the situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>On 29 November, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights published its final report into the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk in 1975.  This is the last of Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s reports to be considered by the committee.  The findings in this report are deeply troubling and a matter of most serious concern.  They paint a very disturbing picture.  I fully support the call for a full debate in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on collusion.</P>
        <P>I have agreed to a request to meet with the relatives of the victims of the Dundalk bombing in the new year.  This will be preceded by a meeting to be held before Christmas with my officials.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the first report of the Oireachtas joint committee, Mr. Patrick MacEntee was appointed as sole member of a commission of investigation to examine specific matters relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, including aspects of the Garda investigation and missing documentation.  The appointment was made on 26 April 2005.</P>
        <P>Last week, Mr. MacEntee provided me with a further interim report and requested a further extension to the timeframe to 14 February 2007.   I have brought this seventh interim report to the attention of the Government and, as with previous such reports, I have published it.  It is clear from this latest interim report that Mr. MacEntee has completed his investigations and that this further period is required to deal with the final arrangements which the commission is obliged to comply with prior to reporting under the Commissions of Investigation Act.</P>
        <P>The interim report indicates that further evidence or other material has also been received during the reporting phase, thereby causing a delay in completion of the report.  On the basis that he has uncovered further information, and in light of the need to deal with the remaining issues in an appropriate manner, I have granted Mr. MacEntee a further extension.  I acknowledge that waiting a further period before Mr. MacEntee&rsquo;s final report is available is difficult for <Col N="1131"/>the victims and survivors.  Nonetheless, it is clear that Mr. MacEntee must be allowed sufficient time to complete his work.</P>
        <P>I established the inquiries by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton, Mr. Justice Barron and, most recently, Mr. MacEntee precisely because of the long-standing suspicions concerning collusion in the 1970s.  We have now had all four reports of the Oireachtas joint committee, following in turn on the four reports by Mr. Justice Barron.  We will also have the report from Mr. MacEntee in February.  I commend all of the work that has been done to date in these investigations.</P>
        <P>I again raised the issue of collusion with Prime Minister Blair when I met him on 4 December in London.  I have made it clear that I want the British Government to examine the findings of all of these reports, as well as the forthcoming MacEntee report.  I appreciate there are many issues on all sides arising from the past but I have consistently emphasised, and I believe Prime Minister Blair understands, the very deep anxiety and widespread concerns arising from these reports and the need for the British Government to play its part in addressing these concerns.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests to try to secure closure now with clarity in respect of these dark and troubling cases.</P>
        <P>I met with the families of the victims and the survivors of the Miami Showband massacre on 30 November.  The story of the Miami Showband massacre, which happened on 30 July 1975, brought the terrible reality of the Troubles home to so many people.</P>
        <P>I expressed my sympathy to the families for the loss of their loved ones and for the terrible ordeal they endured 31 years ago.  I listened carefully as the families described the horrific night of the massacre, when the three members of the band lost their lives, and explained how the events have affected them since then.  The families raised a number of specific questions with me regarding the massacre, which I have undertaken to follow up.</P>
        <P>I met with the family of Eddie Fullerton, the late Sinn F&eacute;in councillor from County Donegal, in Government Buildings on 16 November.  As the House will be aware, Councillor Fullerton was murdered in his home in May 1991.  During the meeting, I expressed my sympathy to the family for their loss.</P>
        <P>I have since asked the T&aacute;naiste and his officials to further examine the concerns of the Fullerton family.  I have also asked both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to seek to ensure the maximum level of cross-Border co-operation required to assist the ongoing investigations into the case, both North and South.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to record my welcome of the fact that the Taoiseach has met with the family of the late Councillor Eddie Fullerton.  I pay tribute to the steadfastness of <Col N="1132"/>that family and recall that the late Eddie Fullerton&rsquo;s son, Albert, was tragically killed earlier this year.  He had tirelessly campaigned for truth and justice in his father&rsquo;s memory.</P>
        <P>Following on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with the Fullerton family, does he agree, having heard the family&rsquo;s representations and having apprised himself of all the critical detail available, that this murder raises disturbing questions?  Does he agree that one of the most worrying aspects of it is the way in which the investigation of the death of Councillor Fullerton was conducted by garda&iacute; in County Donegal?  Is he aware that personal belongings of the late Councillor Fullerton, who he has just reminded us in his response was murdered in May 1991, have still not been returned to the family?  Those belongings were taken from Councillor Fullerton&rsquo;s home.  Fifteen years later, does the Taoiseach agree that is strange and that this and many other aspects of the Garda investigation of the time gave the Fullerton family the sense that it was they and their father who were under investigation and not those responsible for his murder who were being pursued?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach agree these are real and serious matters?  Will he accept that the murder of Councillor Fullerton mirrored many of those investigated by Mr. Justice Barron and which have been exposed by the Oireachtas sub-committee in its most recent series of reports and follow-on to the work of Mr. Justice Barron, and the late Mr. Justice Hamilton preceding, demonstrating collusion between British Crown forces and loyalist paramilitaries?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the murder of Councillor Fullerton bears all the hallmarks of those who have carried out other such attacks and atrocities in this State over the years and that the form of its execution showed a sophistication and a training which presumably could only have been available to those who had been trained in such actions and very likely by the British Crown forces in the North?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate his willingness to proceed to a full public inquiry, which is the request and the requirement of the family in their pursuit of truth and justice on the death of a husband and father?  He was an Irish public representative, a member of Donegal County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should confine himself to a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the then Buncrana Urban District Council.  In that context, will the Taoiseach indicate to the House today that he will move to establish all the facts by such a method, recognising something which is not a small matter, namely, that in the fullness of time if Councillor Fullerton had lived, I have no doubt he would have been sitting on these benches just as Taoiseach and I?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1133"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  We had a meeting at which all the points raised by the Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in were included in a submission presented to me by the family.  They give me an oral presentation of the facts and they have also been communicating with my officials.  We have taken their submission in its entirety, which includes all the points the Deputy raised, and I have written to the T&aacute;naiste and his officials, who were also at that meeting with me, asking that they further examine all the concerns of the Fullerton family.  I have also asked the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to seek to ensure the maximum level of cross-Border co-operation is given, which the family asked me to do, to assist in the ongoing investigation into this case.</P>
        <P>The Garda is carrying out a full review of the case, which is still ongoing.  I fed into that review the points made by the family.  I understand from the T&aacute;naiste that the Garda review is nearly completed.  The Garda will obviously take into account what I have said recently.  This is an extensive review led by a chief superintendent.  More than 120 interviews of witnesses took place and all the papers, documents and what has been said by everybody concerned over a long period have been taken into account.</P>
        <P>For the sake of completeness, the family has a number of concerns about the review process.  I passed on their views on that in a forthright manner.  It would be a pity if the work was done and it did not give them satisfaction.  I have dutifully passed on the family&rsquo;s points to the Garda, and asked it to take account of them because, as the Deputy said, the family are decent and respectful people.</P>
        <P>I am advised that one main item outstanding is a request for mutual assistance from the PSNI.  I understand there has been contacts between the Garda and the Historical Enquiries Team, the HET.  I have asked to be kept up to date on developments, and the T&aacute;naiste will do likewise.</P>
        <P>For the information of the House, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, has announced she will investigate Eddie Fullerton&rsquo;s murder.  Any assistance the authorities in this State can offer that inquiry should also be given.  Between the two sets of work we have achieved what the Deputy set out.  We will have to see where that goes and how much co-operation we will get, but I will keep the matter under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of questions arising from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply.  He said that the delay in regard to the MacEntee inquiry is regrettable, with which we all agree, but it is due to the fact that new evidence has continued to be brought forward.  Surely it could be a tactic to delay an inquiry if new evidence is being dripfed on an interminable basis.  Will a cut-off date be set following which all the evidence that has been received will be considered or how will the <Col N="1134"/>Taoiseach deal with possible dripfeeding of information that may be never ending?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said there is a need for the British Government to play its part in addressing the relatives&rsquo; concerns, which I fully accept.  Is there also a need for the Irish Government to play its part?  Is there a role this Government could play that would be independent of requesting the British Government to play a role, as this is an international matter that concerns the Irish State as well as the British state?</P>
        <P>In the context of bringing forward initiatives from the Irish side, will the Taoiseach suggest the holding of a single issue British-Irish summit on the matter?  Is that something he has considered?  Will he put such a proposal to the British Prime Minister?  We discussed the establishment of some form of a truth and reconciliation commission in the past and the view at the time was that it was not the right time to establish it.  Is there ongoing consideration of the establishment of such a commission as a way of hopefully bringing closure and a certain amount of healing following all the hurt of the past?</P>
        <P>I welcome that a D&aacute;il debate on this area is planned and I hope it can take the form of a motion &mdash; as in the case of a previous debate on the on the Pat Finucane case &mdash; on the establishment of an international independent inquiry.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when that debate will take place?  Will it be next February, March or some other time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues.  On the question of a planned debate, it would be useful if it took the form of a motion.  It might take place in the second half of February or early March when there tends to be a focus on Irish issues in the broader world.  It would be a idea to have it then.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the broad issue of closure, I have said previously to the Deputy that I am a supporter of the prospect of a truth commission, which the Deputy has raised over a number of years.  There is the question of how it can be formed.  Many people simply want closure; they do not want any talk about this.  It happened a long time ago and they just want to move on.  Obviously, they will never stop grieving but they want to do that privately and they do not want to be part of any group.  That is a sizeable group.  Another sizeable group wants at least a good account taken of what happened.  They are happy, if they can be, of the work being done by the Historical Enquiries Team.  They are satisfied with that work; they see these cases being properly dealt with and there is proper dealings with the Garda, the PSNI and Nuala O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s office.  There is another group which is active on all of these issues and tends to only want to examine one aspect and not all of the other aspects.</P>
        <P>From where I sit, it would be good to bring this to an end &mdash; I have meet RUC widows groups, RUC families, Nationalist families, republican <Col N="1135"/>families and paramilitary groups &mdash; by finding some way of bringing them all into some process.  I tried to do that by pressing hard for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission some years ago.  To say I got a collective &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that proposal is an understatement.  The Deputy and I predicted at that time that as the trouble ended more people would reflect on matters.  I have been through these meetings with people, which I am honoured to have been through, but I can see their hurt and I have got vivid accounts of exactly what happened in 1971, 1969 and 1973.  I can understand all that, but there must be a process to bring it to an end.  We have not quite reached that stage.  Some of the issues can be answered and there is much work to be done.  The work of the historical inquiries team is very useful and is very well resourced.  The Secretary of State, Mr. Hain, has put many people on this team.  They are going back through all the records and they will do much good work, which is something I have heard from the victims&rsquo; commission.  The interim victims&rsquo; commissioner is now in place and important work is being done.  There is a remembrance commission, into which we have put a lot of resources.</P>
        <P>Much is being done but if I am asked whether these will bring matters to a close, there is no satisfactory answer.  The standard thing to do is to set up a public inquiry, but I am in the position where I must tell people the truth about many of these things.  I cannot see where we are going to get the co-operation, the details and the facts.  We might get that for some cases, but not for many others.  We would be giving another answer, but we would not resolve the cases.  I have been straight with groups about that and I have been holding my hand in so many dykes when I tell them that I will not grant a Government inquiry because I do not believe it will work.</P>
        <P>I have pressed hard on the British Government, as have my Ministers and officials.  Without marching out of rooms, the message has been clearly received that the British Government needs to make a far greater effort to get its security system to provide reports.  That is why we are getting more information.  A genuine effort has been made and almost all of last week&rsquo;s meeting on 5 December with the Prime Minister and his officials concerned this issue.  To put it in layman&rsquo;s terms, we had it out with them and we quoted the Oireachtas report extensively, not for the first time.  I told the Prime Minister that it was my view and the view of the Government and the Oireachtas that it was not good enough to let this drift indefinitely.  The British Government must deal with this issue through some process.</P>
        <P>Mr. MacEntee wants to finish the job.  He is not interested in taking up the invitations I made in respect of the other committees.  At the same time, he feels he is getting somewhere.  It is one thing to get information and co-operation, but there are also circumstances surrounding that.  I <Col N="1136"/>am not privy to what exactly he received &mdash; I have a general view of it &mdash; but it seems to me that there is a legal nightmare surrounding it in terms of the name game etc.  I am not a legally trained person.  The circumstances in which MI5 can provide information is legally complex.  I detect that even someone as good as Mr. MacEntee is having problems with that.  He will see this out and wants to do so.  The House has been urging me to put pressure on the British Government to get more information, and we have received more in 2006.  The question of how that can be used is for another day.</P>
        <P>I was pleased that the Secretary of State, Mr. Hain, yesterday accepted that the Oireachtas committee and the Government were entitled to be raising these issues and that his Government would do everything possible to bring closure to these issues.  That was the first time such a statement was made.  I was not at the meeting, but that was the view of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other officials.  I believe that statement followed from the meeting we had in No. 10 Downing Street last week.  We have had four reports from Mr. Justice Hamilton and Mr. Justice Barron, we have had four Oireachtas reports and we have the MacEntee report.  We have a great body of intelligence gathered on all of the cases.  We have tried to put the similarities in these reports together and present them in a way that makes our collective view clear to the British.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to go back over this territory, but does the Taoiseach have an accord with Mr. MacEntee?  This is the seventh deferral.  I am sure he has very good reasons for asking for a deferral, but is the February deadline likely to be met on this occasion?</P>
        <P>No member of the loyalist paramilitaries has ever been charged with atrocities committed south of the Border.  Given that an historical inquiries team has been put in place in Northern Ireland, does the Taoiseach think there might be merit in putting a similar team in place to investigate atrocities that have never been accounted for in this jurisdiction, by paramilitaries of whatever hue?  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to the call made by the committee for an international investigation along the lines of the investigation led by Judge Cory?  Does he have his mind made up about that particular committee recommendation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte has asked me the first question a number of times.  I probably told him that it was the last report, but further information came about.  I can understand the delay because of that, but it will not help us if we keep going on about the issue.  I hope it will end in February, but I cannot be positive about that.</P>
        <P>Our historical inquiries team is different because of the volume of cases involved, but the Garda now has a core group researching into cases like the murder of Councillor Eddie <Col N="1137"/>Fullerton.  I am not sure of the total number of cases, but there is a detailed account on some of them.  The historical inquiries team in Northern Ireland has thousands of cases and the situation is therefore different.  We have had a look back on cases such as the Dundalk bombings and so on.</P>
        <P>I had originally hoped that Mr. MacEntee would be able to move on from his report and deal with some of the other reports arising from it.  He certainly will not do this, but I am not sure whether we will get an international figure to do it.  The solution involving Judge Cory worked in that case, but I do not think it will work again.  There was trouble in agreeing on a person, and then there was conflict about the report the person produced.  I am referring to the Finucane case where we had an agreement, but after a certain date it was not accepted.  There was an issue about the inquiry into that.  I am not too sure if that is the difficulty.  To be brutally frank, without the co-operation of the British authorities we cannot progress as far as we want on these issues.  In all of these cases it is essential to have the co-operation of the British if we are to take matters further.  I have made clear to them there is a process, but we have not identified as yet what it should be.  I am reluctant just to pick one or two more cases because that does not end matters.  We did that as regards the Cory reports.  There was a view that by taking a few high profile cases on both sides, that would bring matters to an end.  However, I can see the number of cases being extended.   The Historical Enquiries Team together with work being done in the South will deal with many of the cases, but we must find some other way to bring closure to so many cases from a brutal past.</P>
        <P>I am not satisfied we have found the best way to do that as yet, but I shall continue to engage with the British Government in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I was reading some of the cuttings in respect of the Miami Showband killings on 30 July 1975, which many people will recall.  I know the Taoiseach has met members of the families.  Mr. Justice Barron, in his reflections on that case, said it painted a clear picture of collaboration between members of the security forces and loyalist extremists.  He said the inquiry would be shutting its eyes to reality if it accepted that such collaboration was limited to the cases in which collusion had been proven.  By September of that year, the identities of the murder gang were known &mdash; arising from the minutes of a meeting involving the then British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, the Northern Ireland Secret of State at the time, Mr. Merlyn Rees, the future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the late Mr. Airey Neave, MP.  That went on to say there had been serious infiltration by extremist Protestants in the south Armagh area. </P>
        <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach can indicate whether Prime Minister Blair has made any further <Col N="1138"/>advance as regards providing information that can assist in view of Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s recommendations.  Is it the same old story?  I know the Taoiseach has raised this matter on quite a number of occasions, but it does not seem to have got anywhere.  Is he hopeful that Prime Minister Blair might, perhaps, change his mind in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The first report was the work of Mr. Patrick MacEntee, SC.  The second report was on the 1972-73 bombings and the third was on the death of Mr. Seamus Ludlow.  Then there is the current report.  There is definitely strong evidence of collusion and the British Government is very much aware of our concern in this regard.  The Miami Showband tragedy is one of many incidences.  I spelt out clearly for the British Government the view pertaining in this House and the conclusions reached by Mr. Justice Barron, against the backdrop of the location and the people we are dealing with.  More will need to be done to progress the reports further.  However, the British are in no doubt as regards our views and our feelings on these issues.  In the Miami Showband case there is certainly a strong sense that loyalists and the UDR were working hand in hand.  Even the surviving member of the band strongly maintains that a senior British Army officer was present that night.  There is a lot of evidence and we have done well to present it all.  What the final outcome will be is another question, but we have progressed matters significantly.</P>

	<P>There are five proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed?  Agreed. </P>
     
        <P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 21 and 22 without debate, motions re service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2004 and 2005 agreed?  I call Deputy Boyle.</P>

	<P>I wish to express the Green Party&rsquo;s reservations on this method of doing business in respect of these two motions.  It had been proposed a number of weeks ago that they would be put on the Order Paper and a debate was agreed to at the time.  The House should take an opportunity on an annual basis to discuss how the Defence Forces are being deployed in UN missions throughout the world.  It should so do both to offer words of support and to examine questions as to whether they are being properly resourced.  Placing two motions on an Order Paper like this, without even having the secondary option of having the motions debated at the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, is not a practice this House should adopt.</P>
   </Speaker>
        <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with Nos. 21 and 22 without debate, motions re service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2004 and 2005, be agreed to&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
   
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We now move on to the third proposal.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 6, Second and Subsequent Stages of the Social Welfare Bill 2006 agreed?  I call Deputy Boyle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the procedure being adopted, which has been adopted for several Bills in this last week of business.  The idea of a single vote after a Second Stage debate has been exhausted without an opportunity for a Report Stage debate is not a good practice for this House.  The House should not adopt this procedure as a standard practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a similar point regarding the import of this Bill.  As a general practice, I do not believe this to be an <Col N="1141"/>appropriate approach to carrying out the business of the House.  While all Members appreciate the importance of what is entailed, the continually repeated practice of cramming and ramming through legislation with guillotines in the last week of a session is inappropriate and does not make for good legislation.</P>
 </Speaker>
        <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 6, Second and Subsequent Stages of the Social Welfare Bill 2006, be agreed to&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
     
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 33, Report and Final Stages of the Europol (Amendment) Bill 2006 agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 7, Second and Subsequent Stages of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2006 <i>[Seanad]</i> agreed?  Agreed.</P>
        <P>I call Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach three questions.  He is aware I may not be present tomorrow as I must attend a meeting in Brussels.  The D&aacute;il is to be recalled two days earlier than was previously expected to discuss legislation dealing with the nursing homes inspectorate.  Opposition Members have called for that Bill on several occasions.  Will the days in question be normal sitting days with Taoiseach&rsquo;s Questions and Leaders&rsquo; Questions?  If the D&aacute;il is to be recalled, it should be recalled for its full purpose.</P>
        <P>Second, a nationwide issue has been brought to my attention recently.  A considerable number of parent-teacher meetings lack interpretation facilities to discuss children&rsquo;s performance with parents.  While I am aware such a facility exists within the Department of Education and Science, it is not sufficiently widespread.  I refer to Polish and Latvian people and so on.</P>
        <P>In this context, when can Members expect the publication of the proposed education Ireland Bill?  The Government&rsquo;s legislative programme suggests a date sometime in 2007.</P>
        <P>Third, as this is the last week of this session, Members will not have a debate on the Harris report on the quality of spoken Irish in primary schools in this session.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will remind the Government Whip to facilitate it some time in the next session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The education Ireland Bill is due in 2007.  As we have not seen the heads of the Bill yet, I cannot give Deputy Kenny a date in this regard.  As there is a commitment to debate the Harris report, I will ask the Government Whip to arrange it.  As for the sitting during the week in which the House will return, its purpose will be to discuss legislation and to deal with the legislation only.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Deputy Kenny that the notion of a window dressing week in January <Col N="1142"/>is entirely unacceptable.  At the last count, I understand that 11 guillotines will have operated this week.  This is against the background in which the House was suspended three times in this term.  It is now proposed that the House should return without an Order of Business, parliamentary questions, Adjournment Debates or Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  Members will have a sanitised week, which is a most unfortunate precedent and the Labour Party will oppose it.</P>
        <P>Am I correct in deducing there will not be a referendum after all on the protection of the child?  I read in the newspapers that the Taoiseach is retreating from his earlier position.  He sent out his backbenchers to agree one thing at the committee, as well as two Ministers who, unusually, served on the committee.  However, he is now minded to take a different view.  I heard the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, state that whatever is decided, it is unlikely to be decided this side of the general election.  Can the Taoiseach clarify the position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do so gladly.  What I said to the Deputy last week remains the position.  While the Government will deal with the second issue shortly, the position is still that if we can get agreement, we will proceed.  Just because I noted last week that people are entitled to express a view, that should not mean that I have changed from the discussion that took place at the committee.  The Government must and will decide that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am unsure whether Members are any the wiser.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Hopefully we will have a referendum in the spring.  That is the answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the answer.  Very well.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the January sittings as it does not do the House any good to give the impression it is returning in January without Government accountability apart from the debate on the nursing home issue.  While that issue is important, it is not what the D&aacute;il is established to do in full.  Government accountability and Taoiseach&rsquo;s Questions are also required.  Perhaps there will be an opportunity between now and tomorrow to reflect on this.</P>
        <P>I refer to promised legislation.  Following the issues highlighted by the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; television programme, it is particularly important for Members to see the promised legislation in the area of consumer protection.  This matter is more urgent than ever following that programme, given the comparison between a salesman and a con man made on that programme which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need to make a Second Stage speech in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe what was said, with the expletive, was nailing buyers to the effing wall.  This is not the kind of consumer protection which is tolerable.</P>

	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the difficulties being experienced by many non-Irish trained pharmacists?  Some have had their Health Service Executive contracts withdrawn because of the three year rule.  I have asked about the pharmacy Bill four times in this session and each time have been assured that it would be taken during this session.  The Minister for Health and Children took the Order of Business three weeks ago and assured me it would be taken in this session and that it would resolve the problem faced by those pharmacists at present.  At least one pharmacist in my constituency now runs his pharmacy at a loss.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I will be at the European Council tomorrow and Friday, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you, your Office, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and all the members of staff here in the Houses of the Oireachtas every good wish for the Christmas period and to thank them very much for their co-operation throughout the year and for the long hours they put in to make this House function.  I include in these wishes all of our staff, the ushers, the Superintendent of the House, the Captain of the Guard and all of the related staff, and also the clerical, administrative and secretarial staff who do so much work.  The House has remained open far longer, and for longer hours, in recent years &mdash; perhaps more than the public believes &mdash; but it is through the dedication and support of all of the support services in the House that we all can do our jobs.  I express my appreciation for their great efforts, which I know are appreciated by all Members.</P>
        <P>I also want to thank the Oireachtas press corps who diligently report the issues of the House.  I would wish them a happy Christmas in person if they were here, but I will do it <i>in absentia</i>.</P>
        <P>Also over the past year on a number of occasions there have been expressions of sympathy here for former Members but also for relatives of present Members of the House, and it is fitting that we should remember the families of former Members and of deceased family members of present Members as well in our prayers over Christmas.</P>
        <P>I would also like to extend best wishes to my colleagues on the Opposition benches, to Deputies Kenny, Rabbitte, Sargent and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, and the Technical Group.  While I spend my time answering all their difficult questions, it does not take away from my great admiration for them.  We all have a hard job.</P>

I certainly admire my colleagues with whom I must deal every day.  Even if we are fulfilling our parliamentary duties of being at loggerheads on this, that and the other matter, it does not take from my respect for them.</P>
        <P>I thank my colleagues for their work during the year.  Everyone associated with this House puts in a full and tough year.  Christmas is the one time when we can collectively take a break and have the opportunity to relax and enjoy the season.  On my behalf and on behalf of the Government, I wish everyone a very happy Christmas agus Nollaig faoi sh&eacute;an is faoi mhaise daoibh go l&eacute;ir.</P>

On behalf of the Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, I reciprocate the Christmas greetings to the Taoiseach and Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte.  I hope that goodwill will extend beyond political differences and keep us focused on the challenges that face us.  These go beyond any single party or the term of any Government, the energy crisis being the one that springs to mind most often.</P>
        <P>The spirit of inclusiveness is reflected in the amount of colour on the Christmas tree on Leinster Lawn.  It is indicative of an inclusive spirit that has descended on the decorators as well as on the Taoiseach.  That the predominant colour is green is incidental, it is nonetheless interesting to see such a festively decorated tree compared to the bland but attractive colour schemes of previous years.  Perhaps there has been a change of thinking.</P>

	<P>The Acting Chairman had the good luck of being in the Chair last evening when I was making my contribution.  It must have been by popular acclaim that he was asked to return and listen to the rest of it.  I welcome him.</P>

	<P>Thank you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Our social welfare code has two systems, namely, the benefit and allowances systems.  The benefit system is insurance-based.  One pays stamps into an insurance fund and when difficulties arise, such as unemployment or disability, one can draw on the fund and collect money based on stamps paid.  It is like car insurance.</P><Col N="1152"/>
        <P>Last evening I was critical of the Minister as there are issues arising from this that he needs to address.  If someone is in receipt of, for example, unemployment or disability benefit, one does not receive the Christmas bonus because they are not on a long-term payment.  I strongly suggest that is unfair.  The child dependant allowance for young people in education is not available if one is in receipt of benefit.  That is not fair.  Those on social welfare benefit are obviously on a low income and if one&rsquo;s child is in higher education, they cannot qualify for the top-up payment.  A small number of people are affected and these anomalies should be sorted out.  It is unfair that these should exist and I ask the Minister to examine them.  While I know he will not be in office next year, I ask that he put it in train so that it may be carried on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>One never knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Minister&rsquo;s potential for looking at problems and sorting them out.</P>
        <P>Based on the insurance system, I have a problem with a number of items.  The first relates to stamps or benefit-based payments.  If a man works for a county council, health board or any company and pays an A stamp but, Lord forbid, dies, his wife will qualify for a widow&rsquo;s contributory pension based on the stamps he paid into his insurance scheme, which covers her and his children in the event of his passing on.  It is a good system, although we would like to see higher payments as widows and widowers are the great forgotten people of this country.  My problem is with the fact that, if the man&rsquo;s widow happens to work in her own right and has accumulated stamps, on reaching 65 or 66, she is entitled to an old age pension based on her own stamps.  She would also be entitled to a widow&rsquo;s pension based on her late husband&rsquo;s stamps but the Minister will not pay her out of both insurance schemes.  He will only pay out of one but that is not fair because if people contribute to two pension funds, which is what they are, they should be entitled to draw from them.  I ask the Minister to look at that aspect.</P>
        <P>I welcome the budget announcement that carers in receipt of a social welfare payment will receive half the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  A couple of years ago, I put on the record the case of a widow who looked after her mother-in-law but, as well as losing her husband, she lost out on those payments.  Can the Minister clarify in his response to this part of the debate whether a recipient of widow&rsquo;s pension and a small pension from her husband&rsquo;s employer &mdash; for example, a county council or a health board &mdash; who has been sanctioned to become a carer, will receive the half payment?  Will the small pension she receives be taken into account or will it fall within the income disregard?  The Minister may not have thought about the issue.  If that is the case, I ask him to do so in a sympathetic way.</P><Col N="1153"/>
        <P>As I said, widows are the great forgotten people and the Minister could do a few extra things for them.  He could give them free travel because it would be a big bonus for them.  I met a widow recently who asked me a question concerning the companion pass for which I had no answer, although the Minister and his officials may have one.  She has a free travel pass but wanted a companion pass.  If she had a partner or husband she would receive a companion pass for them but, because she has neither, she wonders why she cannot nominate somebody else.  She is condemned to be alone because of circumstances outside her control and, if she wants to travel, she will have to do so alone because of circumstances outside her control.  Widows should get special treatment.</P>
        <P>The treatment of widows in the budget not by the Minister, but by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, was an absolute disgrace.  He announced an additional tax credit for widows and widowers of &euro;50 per annum, which is approximately 90c per week and is appalling.  If he was not going to do something worthwhile for them, he should not have insulted them.  It was a major slip-up, one of the few in the budget, and the Minister should consider how to put it right.</P>
        <P>Free travel comes under the Minister&rsquo;s remit and must be of great benefit to those living in Dublin or places where there is a good transport system.  In rural areas, however, it is of limited benefit as many small towns and villages do not have a bus service or, if they have, it consists of one bus per day.  What does the Minister think of free travel being dispensed by way of vouchers which can be cashed through a taxi service?  Given the effect curbs on drink driving are having on rural pubs, might it not be a good idea to allow a man, who loves to visit his pub for a few pints on a couple of occasions during the week but cannot drive home, to have 40, 50 or 60 vouchers in lieu of a free travel pass, each worth &euro;5, to pay for a taxi home which otherwise would be very expensive?  That would not be of great use in cities but it would be of great benefit to rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>How long have I left?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Three minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Time passes quickly.</P>
        <P>Carers do a fantastic job and we must support them by bolstering the services available to them.  The Minister said the respite grant was now payable to 40,000 carers, including approximately 30,000 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowances plus a further 8,000 to 10,000.  There must, however, be more people who qualify for the respite grant and we must make more effort to help them.</P>
        <P>The family income supplement, FIS, is a very good system.  I am glad the Minister is topping it up but why do an estimated 50% of people entitled to it not claim?  We must renew our efforts to make people aware of the supplement. <Col N="1154"/> I know a couple who worked in NEC in Ballivor until it closed down and they were made redundant.  They considered what to do with their lives and the man, who was relatively young, wanted to do something to maintain the good lifestyle he had.  Accordingly, he has become an apprentice electrician, working with a local contractor.  He is earning a wage and has applied for FIS because the family is on a low income.  I hope the Minister will tell me a mistake was made but the FIS section told him he would be paid the supplement while he was working but that, while he completed his module at college, although still being paid by the contractor, it would not be paid.  That is unfair and wrong and I hope the Minister will clarify whether a mistake has been made.  If an apprentice is trying to better himself or herself &mdash; from the Minister&rsquo;s time in the system he knows apprentices must do a period of training &mdash; he or she is under the auspices of the local contractor.  It would be wrong to shut off the payments during the training period.  I hope the Minister will give a positive clarification regarding this situation.</P>
        <P>Is it not anomalous that the Department of Social and Family Affairs recognises two people living together as a unit for social welfare purposes, such as the provision of the dependent spouse allowance, whereas the tax code does not?  Is it not strange that if one&rsquo;s wife or husband is not working, one can get a married person&rsquo;s allowance, but one cannot get it if one&rsquo;s partner is not one&rsquo;s spouse?  How can this be justified when those people are treated as husbands and wives for social welfare purposes?  Should this matter not be addressed?</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for bearing with me.  Yesterday, the Minister gained much kudos.  In general, the budget was good and it solved some of the anomalies, but there is more to do.  Perhaps it is not in the Minister&rsquo;s jurisdiction, but I hope someone will take the opportunity to address the issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, the backdrop to which is a period of phenomenal achievement, such as major increases in employment, strong and healthy economic growth and a continuation of the low taxation, job creation and wealth creation policies pursued by the Government, which has transferred wealth to those who need it most.</P>
        <P>Many believe that this occurs by accident.  A number of commentators take our strong economic growth, low unemployment levels, strong job creation and low taxation for granted.  However, this has come about due to difficult decisions made in the 1980s and early 1990s by Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, which is an <Col N="1155"/>important point to make in the context of discussing the spending of money.</P>
        <P>The budget pursues the policy of encouraging and fostering enterprise, keeping taxation low, providing strong economic stability and ensuring a prosperous country.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has tabled reforming proposals and has not been afraid to review some social welfare pensions and payments or to challenge us.  A number of issues, such as care of the elderly and pension provisions for the public service and people without State or contributory pensions, are coming down the tracks.  If the same types of policies are pursued in the coming years, the public will accept that they should be continued to allow us to address the fundamental challenges.  The budget proposed the same philosophy followed heretofore.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Bill, we are discussing a spend of &euro;15.3 billion, a significant increase in social welfare payments during the Government&rsquo;s lifetime.  The backdrop to this spending is 4% unemployment and strong economic growth.  Many resources are going to those most in need and we will continue to target those areas.</P>
        <P>The matter of carers stands out and I welcome the increase of &euro;20 in carer&rsquo;s allowance, which is a strong indication of what we must do in respect of care of the elderly and home care.  Given the recent announcements of home care packages by the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance, we will begin to realise that the best form of provision of care is in the home.  While we often debate how to provide care, the facts speak for themselves and the Bill addresses the issue in a positive way.  In the coming years, there will be more targeted approaches to the provision of care in the home.</P>
        <P>The respite grant scheme is positive.  In the context of the previous budget, I highlighted the respite grant in a leaflet drop, but I was amazed by how many people were unaware of it.  They applied for the top-up of &euro;2,400.  Like some public representatives, will the Minister and the Department publicise the scheme as much as possible?  The grant will be increased to &euro;1,500, which is a generous acknowledgement of the worthiness of the sacrifices made when caring for people.</P>
        <P>Due to the increase in fuel costs, many public representatives have lobbied the Government regarding the fuel and energy allowance.  The doubling of the allowance to &euro;18 is a welcome measure and an acknowledgement that we are in a position to target resources in those areas.  I remember listening to people discussing increases of &pound;1.40 in the old age pension, but we can now discuss increasing basic pensions by &euro;20.  That the Bill has many positive aspects has been acknowledged across the board.</P>
        <P>The Minister has put the challenge of alleviating child poverty to us.  Society has a fundamental duty to target significant resources on this matter, such as the family income supplement and child <Col N="1156"/>benefit payments.  Society will do itself a disservice if we do not tackle child poverty because it will lead to cyclical problems and generational poverty, that is, people will be unable to escape the poverty trap.</P>
        <P>The Minister has many ideas to encourage parents to take back to education schemes and to return to work.  Some people left school at an early age and have poor education standards, self-esteem and literacy levels.  They are unable to find the confidence to return to the education system and the workplace.  Training schemes and finding employment for such people would be a positive measure.  In a way, the community employment schemes served that purpose, but the best way to address child poverty is to return parents to the workplace.  It requires a great deal of thought and the Minister will table more proposals in that regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome the increase of &euro;10 in the child benefit payment and the generous child care package.  We must acknowledge that child care payments are intended for the provision of child care or related costs.  While some say the Government should do more, this provision and the tax code acknowledge the cost of providing child care.  For example, &euro;15,000 can be earned tax free by a person providing child care.  Given the significant increases in grants for child care spaces and facilities, we will reach an equilibrium.  Child care costs should level off and people will see child care as affordable.  The Government has fully acknowledged the difficulties for parents trying to find affordable child care and local authorities now recognise the need for cr&egrave;ches to be included in planning applications for large housing developments.</P>
        <P>There is a problem in urban areas, where a person might want to provide a child care facility in his or her home in an estate, converting the front room or the garage.  The local authorities seem to be incapable of looking at this in a positive light, where child care could be provided for residents of an estate by another resident.  Local authorities should be more imaginative in granting planning permission for the change of use for child care provision in someone&rsquo;s home.  Regulations govern cr&egrave;ches but this offers an opportunity for parents who want to stay at home with their own children to make use of the tax break of &euro;15,000 on income earned from child care.  Local authorities should encourage this positive development instead of forcing parents to bring their children to industrial complexes to access child care.</P>
        <P>There has been an increase of four weeks in the paid leave available for maternity leave, bringing it up to 26 weeks, and unpaid leave has been increased from four weeks to 16 weeks, a total of 42 weeks.  It is a welcome move and I urge that we continue to look at this.  It is imperative that the challenges in raising children are met and families are allowed time and space for themselves.</P><Col N="1157"/>
        <P>I compliment the Minister.  This social welfare package has been well received by the people and will go a long way to addressing the challenges that exist and there is more good news to come.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2007.  Deputy Kelleher referred to the overall economic climate and it is sometimes worrying to hear so many speakers refer to the country being awash with money.  One would be forgiven for thinking it came down with the rain, suddenly appearing for us to exploit.  Since 1997, the Government has set out carefully to create the business environment and conditions necessary for a successful economy.  That must be recognised.  The country is not awash with money by accident.</P>
        <P>I remember the Taoiseach pointed out after the 1997 budget that the best benefit we could offer anyone was a job.  He also said it was necessary to create the wealth before we could divide it up.  Speakers differ philosophically but we had to create the wealth first.  Now problems in education, health and social welfare are being addressed by funds created through taxation or other methods.  That tax would not be paid unless the country was doing very well because the necessary conditions exist nationally and internationally.</P>
        <P>Taxation is outside the Minister&rsquo;s brief but I refer to my own situation, which I use as a personal indicator of how bad things were.  In 1986-87, with nine mouths to feed in a single income household, I paid 67% in stoppages, getting &pound;33 in every &pound;100 while trying to support nine people.  That was immoral, an enormous burden on larger families.  I said I would fight that every step of the way when we got back in here.  I have been here for some years since and my group in particular has made great headway.  Comparing that situation to the situation now, I pay less than one third of the previous figure but I still make a fair contribution to the economy.  We must remember that.</P>
        <P>In the past the Opposition has objected to me referring to the record of the rainbow Government and its socialist element giving pensioners an increase of &pound;1.60 a week but that is the only comparison I can make.  I must look at the performance of that group when it was in power.  We also compare favourably with the British situation in terms of pensions.  It is fair to the public to point out what people did and what they would do again if they got the opportunity.  The only other way to compare is to measure against the British and we have done exceptionally well under the Minister&rsquo;s watch.  We can compare any project.  Older people do much better here than in Britain and we have much higher standards.</P>
        <P>Visitors to the country are fascinated by the high standard and availability of free travel.  Free travel will always be associated with the late Mr. Haughey but the current Minister, Deputy <Col N="1158"/>Brennan, has put his own stamp on it.  I asked previous Ministers to remove the impediment in the system that limited travel times and for a couple of years I was told it was impossible, that CIE would not agree to it, but lo and behold, the Minister has removed that impediment.</P>

	<P>He has also negotiated all-island travel.  There will be a more regular transfer of people from the South to the North and <i>vice versa</i>.  This will be of benefit because ordinary people will have a far greater exchange of views and opinions.  Those of us who joined the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in 1990 were fascinated by the lack of knowledge of our counterparts in Westminster about how we live and behave in the South.  The same is true of many residents of the northern part of the country.  The all-island travel programme will have the added benefit of securing greater integration so we will realise we all live on the one island, are the same race and have the same hopes and fears.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I was interested that some speakers mentioned improvements that could be made to the pensions system because no one has done more on pensions than this Government.  I remember adverse comment from the Opposition benches when the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, decided to put away a large amount of Exchequer funding for future pension needs.  Previous Ministers had used this money for various infrastructural projects and so on in the past but the funding was put aside to meet the needs of future pensioners.  I had been hearing for years about the pensions time bomb but nobody throughout Europe did anything or cared too much about it until the former Minister got a grip on it and put the money aside.  Opposition finance spokespersons were hugely critical because of the downturn in the stock market, which affected equities.  Property investors were doing much better and the Government parties were told they had invested incorrectly.  Lo and behold, the position reversed completely and the benefit has doubled but nobody is saying, &ldquo;Well done Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>When representatives of the Pensions Board and the National Treasury Management Agency appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and these facts were trotted out, the committee did not comment negatively, which is incredible.  I am a committee member and I have the take outlining this position.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1159"/>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will hear negative comments shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>We are doing extremely well.  The bottom line is that the courageous political decision to take billions of euro out of the economy and put it aside for the future has been taken.  Opposition parties have stated they would raid this fund and invest the money elsewhere if they were in power.  More needs to be done on pensions.  I ask the Minister to continue to work on pension needs by encouraging younger people to take out pensions, which is difficult.  When most of us were introduced to pensions when we were young, we said it was not for us and we would deal with them down the road.</P>
        <P>The Minister should keep up the good work on the carers issue.  This issue is close to my own heart and he has done tremendously well in this regard.  Deputy Woods began the process and the Minister has taken it on in a big way.  I ask him to maintain his work over the next four or five years and adopt a long-term programme.  I would dread to think that we could lose control of that issue and carers would be back where they were ten years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Durkan.</P>
        <P>I will begin positively.  I welcome a number of changes in the budget, particularly where carers are concerned.  We are waiting to see what the ground rules and regulations will be but the Minister will announce them shortly.</P>
        <P>The Minister increased the disregard for those on the household benefit scheme who were in receipt of a second pension from &euro;50 to &euro;100 a week, which I welcome, but the time has come to abolish the means test for the fuel allowance.  If one is in receipt of a second pension from a county council, health board or the ESB, one should not be refused the fuel allowance, which is small anyway.  The Minister should examine this issue.</P>
        <P>Deputy Dennehy referred to the free travel scheme, which will operate on an all-Ireland basis.  However, I would like the Minister to put a scheme in place where citizens in rural Ireland could use their travel vouchers to take taxis.  There is no Luas in rural Ireland, infrastructure is poor and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann provides a poor service.  I have raised this issue frequently over many years.  When will the Minister bring in a taxi voucher scheme for people who do not have access to public transport in rural Ireland?  It is a genuine proposal, which should be adopted.  Taxi use has expanded and people avail of taxis more frequently.  Ten years ago we only heard about taxis in Dublin.  There are enough brains and computers in the Department.  Why can the officials not put a scheme in place so that people can use travel vouchers for taxis?</P>
        <P>The Minister made an announcement in the budget debate about mobile telephones and the <Col N="1160"/>household package, which he has been talking about for three years.  I hope the package will be before the House quickly because most people have a mobile telephone and significant numbers of people no longer have a land line.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials and officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government appeared before the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs a number of months ago to discuss the most important issue facing elderly people, which is the cost of their refuse service.  The household benefit scheme should include the cost of the refuse service.  Mayo County Council handed this service over to the private sector this week and no waiver scheme will be in place for the elderly, as a result of which we will have problems down the road.</P>
        <P>As I stated on local radio earlier, the time has come for a debate in the House on local government and democracy.  If the Government continues to take away powers from local authorities, will there be any need for them?  County managers are selected, not elected, and elected members have no powers.  There should be a debate before the election to see which party will give back powers to elected representatives and remove them from selected officials.</P>
        <P>I have called for the three schemes dealing with the child dependant allowance to be brought together time and again and I compliment the Minister on doing it.  Children were being discriminated against with three different payments being made &mdash; &euro;21.60, &euro;19.30 and &euro;16.80.  The Minister has rounded the payment up to &euro;22 and while people on the higher rate have lost out, at least the Minister has recognised that a common denominator is needed and all children are equal in the eyes of the State.  I hope the rate will increase next year.</P>
        <P>Widows have not been looked after again.  They have been let down by the State for many years.  They are the forgotten people and something must be done for them.  Given that funding is available, it is time a pension was provided for stay at home mothers who decide they want to raise their family.  They should be rewarded for the job they do in their homes and for society.  They should not be forgotten and left to depend on their mean husbands in some cases.  A number of women come into my clinics whose husbands, despite having plenty of money, will not give it to them or look after them.  They should have a small pension in their own right.  They can make an application for part of their husband&rsquo;s payment but they should receive a full payment if they have stayed at home to raise their families.  I hope the Minister will examine this issue.</P>
        <P>We produced a report on carers many years ago and I was delighted with the recommendation to give people in receipt of a social welfare payment an additional payment amounting to 50% of the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Statistics in the past showed there were more carers than there were <Col N="1161"/>but the respite grant scheme has shown there are not as many carers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing his time.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As Deputy Ring said, the legislation is a little like a curate&rsquo;s egg, as a number of good changes have been made, for which I congratulate the Minister.  However, I support Deputy Ring&rsquo;s call for special recognition for stay at home spouses who, in many cases, have stayed at home for most of their working lives.  They receive no recognition for their work, even though they contribute significantly to society.  They act as carers, workers in the home, house minders, accountants and business managers without any recognition whatsoever.  It is high time they were recognised and I fully subscribe to the Deputy&rsquo;s call.</P>
        <P>Deputy Dennehy mentioned how far ahead of the British system we are but that is not an accurate observation.  There was a time in this country when all payments payable from the UK, especially old age pension payments, were topped up by 25% or more on the basis of a means test.  That has ceased to be the case over the years because the pension system there is weather proofed at this stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, referred to deprivation.  Poverty comes in many shapes and forms and if the Minister visits schools in the areas that have suffered social and economic deprivation throughout the country he will see poverty.  One can see deprivation in families and parents as they collect children from school.  If ever there was a time to address this issue it is surely now, when a spare &euro;7 billion is available of which Ministers were unaware.  This raises questions regarding the type of accounting we engage in nowadays.</P>
        <P>If I were the Minister for Social and Family Affairs I would not rest on my laurels as there are areas of serious deprivation in this city and in every town and village in the country.  Children are going to school in the morning without breakfast, despite efforts in schools and at community level.  This issue has not been addressed by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
        <P>Housing quality represents another aspect of deprivation.  If the Minister lived in the conditions facing many children and parents, when our coffers are overflowing with money, would he be able to give his best?  I do not think so.  There are countless instances of children and parents struggling to survive in appalling conditions and every Member of this House should be aware of this.  Deputy Ring mentioned the efforts of local authorities to improve the situation but there is a great deal of work to be done in this regard and the Minister should give it some serious consideration.</P>
        <P>This may not seem altogether relevant, but deprivation and poverty start in the area of education.  Given the class sizes that prevail in many <Col N="1162"/>parts of the country, is it possible that children emerging from such circumstances will have a fair chance in society and in the workplace?  The answer, simply, is no.  Class sizes are appalling and are as high as 40 in places.  This was not previously the case in what were termed &ldquo;good areas&rdquo;, but that is no longer so.  The impact on society in the future will be colossal and the effects will be felt for a very long time.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned pensions but I do not agree with his outlook in this regard.  Provision for future pension needs is well within the ambit of the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  The population of Ireland is growing and many young people will soon be making contributions, despite all we hear of the aging population.  There has been a large influx of people who now pay tax and make insurance contributions and it is no secret that the same mechanism used for special savings incentive accounts, SSIAs, can be applied to produce adequate funding to meet our future pension needs.  Comparisons with Germany, France and other countries are pointless as they have population problems that do not apply here.</P>
        <P>I welcome the child dependant allowance but I do not think &euro;22 to &euro;25 per week will be of much use to a widow, widower or member of a single parent family.  Regarding the fuel allowance, the increases in gas and electricity prices this year were appalling and without justification.  I have had countless queries from constituents on how this issue will develop and I am sure the same is the case for every Member of the House, including the Minister.  The increases in the fuel allowance do not cover the increases in the prices of gas and electricity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by thanking Deputies on all sides of the House for their comments on and consideration of this Bill.  I am particularly grateful for the kind remarks that were made on aspects of it but I will also take account of criticisms made and questions raised.  We will have a further two hours of debate later, on Committee and Report Stages, and I look forward to answering Deputies&rsquo; more detailed questions at that point.  We were here until 11 p.m. last night and we heard from all sides of the House where there was a broad welcome for the provisions of the legislation, with some concerns and criticisms.</P>
        <P>Deputy Stanton asked if I would extend the back to school clothing and footwear allowance beyond September and I will consider this proposal.  Some 84,000 families with approximately 172,000 children will benefit from that scheme this year at a cost of &euro;25 million.  The general consensus, until now, was that it should focus on September as that is when children go back to school.  Some fears were expressed about spreading the allowance across the year, not that this is what the Deputy suggested.  Perhaps one should not pay a back to school allowance in June or <Col N="1163"/>July, but we will consider Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s proposal to extend the scheme by a month or two.</P>
        <P>Deputy Stanton also asked about the second tier in child income support and my strong view is that a second tier is needed.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has worked on this matter for some time and I urge that this work continue.  In the meantime, I have tried to construct what is effectively a second tier by increasing the family income supplement and easing means tests and disregards.  Most specifically on this matter, I have put almost &euro;60 million towards CDAs, qualified child allowances, as they are now known.  Through these mechanisms I have tried to construct a second tier, of sorts.</P>
        <P>Taking into account child benefit and child dependant allowance, increases of up to &euro;32 per month may be received by the poorest one third of children in the population.  The other two thirds will receive an increase of &euro;10 in child benefit allowance.  This may not be a formal arrangement, but, in effect, it is a two tier system.  I understand that Deputy Stanton is committed to the two tier system and I suggest we have commenced such an initiative as we now pay a higher rate to poorer children.  I urge NESC to complete its work as this system must be constructed in a more formal manner which is interrelated with income tax allowances.</P>
        <P>There was a general welcome for the half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  It is intended that a person in receipt of most social welfare payments, excluding job seeker&rsquo;s allowance or benefit, who is providing someone with full-time care and attention will retain his or her payment as well as receiving the additional payment.  This mirrors the current arrangements for respite care grants.  The level of additional payment that a social welfare recipient will receive will depend on the person&rsquo;s means, with the maximum payment being the equivalent of a half rate carers allowance.  We are still working out some of the details of this measure, which will come into effect in September 2007.  I would like to introduce it earlier but it is not administratively possible to do so.</P>
        <P>With regard to the qualified adult allowance, I mentioned earlier the special increase being made of &euro;23.70.  I expect that approximately 2,000 qualified adults will benefit from this arrangement in 2007 and 6,000 annually thereafter.  From next September, the legislation will allow spouses and partners of State pensioners who are currently receiving joint payments in addition to qualified adult allowance as part of the overall combined personal rate of State pension to move to separate payments of the qualified adult allowance.  It is intended to make the payments separately, although there will be terms and conditions in respect of dependency and it can be paid jointly if people so wish.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s persistence on the issue of young carers.  It is important to note that the national partnership agreement, Towards <Col N="1164"/>2016, commits the Government to conducting a study of the extent to which children take on inappropriate care roles in order to establish the level of impact the issue has on the lives of the children concerned.  Based on the outcome of this study and an analysis of the issues identified therein, a programme of in-home supports will be developed to alleviate specific problems.  That will not entirely address the concerns of Deputy Stanton, who estimated the number of child carers at 3,000.  I am opposed to paying carer&rsquo;s allowance to such children and the Deputy has clarified that he is not asking me to do so.  We will have to investigate what we can do in that area.  Young children should not be forced to become carers and I do not want to do anything that might encourage more children into that role.</P>
        <P>Deputy Penrose raised the issue of free fuel and bulk payments.  A review of allowance recipients on a customer panel indicated that 58% preferred weekly payments, 22% preferred a one-off lump sum, 12% preferred direct debit to a supplier and 8% preferred two lump sum payments during the fuel season.  While the review may have been similar to opinion polls in that one cannot be sure what people will think on the day, it concluded that a single payment would be administratively efficient but could present other difficulties.  The allowance would be paid in advance in September or October, whereas changes in recipients&rsquo; circumstances during the heating season could disqualify them from payments, with the result that they would have to refund any overpayments made.  The review recommended that the weekly payment method should be retained, which is what I have decided to do.  I accept the argument on the lump sum, particularly where oil is purchased at the start of the year, but the weekly system appears to be working well.</P>
        <P>The proposals on lone parents have not gone away.  A series of policy discussions was held recently, the relevant document has been published and legislation is being prepared on the matter.  To the extent that delays have arisen, these are because we are trying to respond to requests from lone parent organisations with regard to ensuring services and supports from other Departments and agencies are harmonised in the legislation.  I am aware Deputy Stanton has repeatedly stressed the importance of child care to this issue.  However, I am not prepared to delay acting on the proposals until everything is ready because that could mean the necessary measures are never introduced.</P>
        <P>Several calls were made regarding a cost of disability payment, which deserves further consideration.</P>
        <P>A number Deputies raised the issue of fuel.  The allowance, which had not been increased for a number of years, was doubled by this Government over the past two years.  Approximately 274,000 people apply for the allowance which, at <Col N="1165"/>an overall cost of &euro;32 million, is an expensive measure.  A further &euro;50 million has been allocated this year to alleviate the increases in electricity and gas prices.  This year&rsquo;s package will, therefore, cost &euro;90 million, which represents a significant level of support.</P>
        <P>I am pleased we were able to increase the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement with effect from January 2007, at an estimated annual cost of &euro;32 million.  I have been urged by Deputies to encourage more people to take advantage of this payment.  We have discussed ways of increasing the involvement of the Revenue Commissioners in light of the requirement that recipients are in employment.  Revenue has included notices about the payment on some of its forms but I would like to work more closely with the agency with regard to improving take-up levels.  A recent campaign has significantly increased the numbers in receipt of the payment to 21,000.</P>
        <P>Several Deputies referred to the argument about whether to measure consistent or relative poverty.  I will not rehearse my position because it has not changed and we already have our hands full in terms of addressing consistent poverty without responding to the 18% to 20% figures claimed by the more academic measurement of risk of poverty.  Those figures are not real and I am determined to focus our energy on the actual problems which exist with regard to consistent poverty.  I do not mind the measure being used but I object to its adoption as a headline poverty figure because it distracts us from focusing on the real issues and is unhelpful in terms of making policies.  While we might eliminate poverty, relative poverty will always exist.</P>
        <P>I will provide figures on Committee Stage with regard to what happens to lone parents and pensioners who receive welfare payments before engaging with various welfare schemes.  I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions on Second Stage.</P>

	<P>This grant was awarded to the Dublin City Business Association under the fochiste gn&oacute;.  This scheme, which was announced by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on 26 November 2005, was open to applicants throughout the country.  It is intended that the scheme will be advertised again early in 2007.  Applications which meet the criteria for the scheme will be considered in the context of the available allocation at that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I have seldom read a more enthusiastic or euphoric press statement from any Minister than the statement that was issued on 21 November last by the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, about this lighting scheme.  He said at the lighting-up ceremony that the lights represent much more than simply &ldquo;Nollaig Shona&rdquo;.  He said that they stand for the increasing re-awakening of interest in the Irish language in Dublin.  He went on to describe the lights as symbolising the forthcoming global shedding of light on the Irish language.  He was referring to the official languages initiative at EU level, which will begin on 1 January next.</P>
        <P>The Minister sees this initiative as being so productive, all-embracing and symbolic that it is not enough for him to tell us he will advertise the scheme.  I am not sure that business associations in cities and towns throughout the country are aware that funding is available for projects of this nature.  Will the Minister consider making it known to such associations that money is available for this worthwhile initiative?  I note there has been an increase of 18%, to &euro;1.5 million, in the Estimates for the cultural and social schemes this year.  If schemes like that are so productive, the Minister should do much more to highlight the fact that such funding is available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy.  We do our best through press releases and contacting various projects to make people aware of these schemes but sometimes people apply because they know a grant is available.  What struck me as being important in this case was that the people involved, the business traders in Dublin, got the idea of having the slogans on the Christmas lights in Irish.  They approached our Department looking for help and we pointed out that we have this fochoiste gn&oacute;.  They did not do it for the grant; they did it because they believed it was something that should be done.  The money we gave was modest compared to the total cost of the lights.  All we paid for was the part of the lights that had the Irish on them; the total cost was &euro;16,687.  What was important was that the business people of Dublin, who invested hundreds of thousands of euro in these lights, thought it would be a good idea to use the Irish language to make Dublin <Col N="1169"/>different.  That was the point they made.  That indicates a positive shift in attitudes.  That is the reason I felt this was so important.  Money is available and I take on board what the Deputy said.  We normally expect the chambers of commerce, business associations and the local authorities to match our funding.  I will examine the possibility of getting a list of all the chambers of commerce and local authorities and writing to them indicating we are re-advertising the scheme.  Nobody will be able to say they did not know about it.  I would like more people to come forward with their projects but they must come up with the matching funding as well.  It is a three-pronged approach.</P>

        <Quest> if he will report on his discussions with the Department of Transport on the provision of a rural transport service in parts of rural Ireland not already provided with such a service; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[43320/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have not had any recent discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, regarding the provision of a rural transport service, I am very aware of the work he is doing in this regard and I fully support the rural transport initiatives being operated by his Department.  </P>
        <P>Indeed, the rural transport initiative, RTI, has been a great success.  It has been operating on a pilot basis since 2002 and, under the initiative, 34 community transport groups around the country are being funded to address the transport needs of their areas through the provision of local transport services.  RTI projects provide public transport services for people in rural areas who otherwise would not have access to transport for shopping and accessing basic essential services.</P>
        <P>The pilot phase of the RTI finishes at the end of this year and preparations are under way to mainstream the RTI from 2007 onwards in line with Government commitments in the matter.  I understand that a budget of &euro;9 million will be provided for the RTI in 2007.</P>
        <P>As articulated in the White Paper on Rural Development, the Government remains committed to providing essential public services in rural areas to ensure a proper environment for economic development, promote social inclusion and support dispersed, viable rural communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised the Minister has not had discussions with the Minister for Transport on rural transport because in his capacity as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs he has a major responsibility to address the anomaly that exists in rural Ireland in that some areas have a transport system while others do not.  My constituency of Galway South, for <Col N="1170"/>example, has a rural transport service but north-east Galway does not have such a service.</P>
        <P>The Minister will agree that senior citizens living in this city have free travel and can travel throughout the city at no personal cost.  On other occasions the Minister or his colleagues may have made great play out of the fact that senior citizens are entitled to free transport.  One may be entitled to something but if it does not exist, surely the Minister will agree it cannot be availed of.  I put it to the Minister that this is discrimination against the people in rural Ireland, those whom the Minister is charged with representing in his capacity as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Our Constitution, which was crafted by the Minister&rsquo;s grandfather, purports to treat all the people equally but the Minister and his Government are upholding a situation where discrimination is being practised against people in this country.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should confine himself to questions, not statements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that in his capacity as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs he will ensure this discrimination and treatment of rural elderly people as second class citizens will be addressed immediately and that areas such as north-east Galway will be provided with a rural transport service as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The easiest way for the Deputy to get an answer to this question is to ask the Minister involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>This Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, has a responsibility in this area as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I do not have a responsibility in this area.  The Minister for Transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the Minister&rsquo;s people who are left without a service.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when it comes to that.  If we look at it logically, I have responsibility for rural affairs, all the deprived areas through the RAPID programme and so on.  One could hardly find an area in which my Department, because of its geographic remit, does not have an input.  If the Government had not made the mainframe decisions, intensive discussions would probably be taking place between my Department and the Department of Transport but as I said in my reply, we are mainstreaming the service.  We are also providing a good deal of extra money.  I do <Col N="1171"/>not need to highlight for the Minister for Transport, who represents a rural constituency, the various issues, some of which the Deputy has mentioned.  I have no doubt that with the extra funding he will try to ensure that as many areas as possible are covered but having made the major decision I must now give him space to work out the minor details.  I am sure the Deputy will welcome the fact that it is now mainstreamed and that there is more money for the rural transport scheme.  As he is aware, I am very anxious that these schemes operate as far as possible through existing organisations that are expanding to ensure we do not keep reinventing the wheel and that we get economies of scale.  I understand in some areas the rural social scheme, for example, has been used.  I am in favour of those innovative solutions but it is fundamentally an issue for the Minister for Transport.  The major decisions have been made.  I do not need to remake them for him.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware Comhairle na Tuaithe has completed its work on the development of a national countryside recreation strategy.  The members of Comhairle na Tuaithe, with the exception of the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association, have endorsed the report.</P>
        <P>I met the President of the IFA, Mr. P&aacute;draig Walshe, the week before last to discuss the issue of access to land for recreational purposes.  The meeting was very positive.  The key issue to be addressed is payment to farmers for work carried out by them, to an agreed standard, on the upkeep and maintenance of walks on their lands.  Following my meeting with Mr. Walshe I have asked that officials of my Department and representatives of the IFA would meet to progress the issue and report back to me before the new year, if possible.</P>
        <P>Payment for access is not under discussion and therefore there is no question of a U-turn on my part.  The fact is that since summer 2005, when the IFA published its document on its proposed walkways initiative there has been very little difference between my position and that of the IFA on this issue.  What the IFA has sought is a payment for the maintenance of specific walks throughout the country and I am fully in agreement that there should be no cost burden on farmers from the maintenance of permissive ways open to the public at no charge.</P>
        <P>Mr. Walshe has gone on record following our meeting stating that payment must be related to the amount of maintenance and amount of development that has to be done on a walkway.</P>
        <P>I see progress on this issue being based on recognised walks such as waymarked ways or shorter walks which would be promoted by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The walks would be managed by local <Col N="1175"/>community groups in the context of local development strategies which are to the drawn up under the rural development programme 2007-13.  I have time and again made clear my view that a local community-based approach is the best way forward where issues of access to the countryside arise.  Where it is not possible to reach agreement, in a particular location, alternative routes should be explored and developed so landowners&rsquo; rights over access to their lands are not interfered with.</P>
        <P>In light of the outcome of my recent meeting with the president of the IFA, I believe the IFA is now approaching this issue in a positive spirit with a view to implementing the countryside recreation strategy put forward by Comhairle na Tuaithe and already endorsed by the other farming organisations on that body.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It could be a question of terminology, but it seems that when the Minister says &ldquo;access&rdquo;, they say &ldquo;upkeep and maintenance&rdquo;.  As has been subsequently reported in the media, the reality is that the expectation now exists for the Government to provide an annual payment towards landowners for the use of these particular walkways.  Unless the Minister can publish clear criteria on how the money will be made available and for what purposes, we can only presume that this is the nature of the discussions he has been having with the farming organisations.</P>
        <P>In a radio interview subsequent to the meeting, the IFA president talked about a cost per metre of walkway.  He stated that the agreement being reached depended on the length of each walkway and such a cost was being agreed with the Department.  To what extent is maintenance needed on these walkways?  Can he give examples where maintenance is needed?  The walkers and tourists who use such walkways are attracted to them because they are as undeveloped as possible.  Unless the Minister is referring to work that needs to be done to cover health and safety regulations, the upkeep and maintenance of many of these would be too minimal to justify an ongoing payment.</P>
        <P>Media outlets have reported that this could cost the taxpayer &euro;15 million on an ongoing basis.  Does the Minister envisage such costs?  If so, why would they be paid on an ongoing basis if the upkeep and maintenance needed on these routes are minimal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked a lot of questions.  Any payment will be based on the cost of materials and labour in doing the works that are necessary.  We will get competent people to calculate exactly what work is needed.</P>
        <P>I heard the interview Mr. Walshe gave on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and I obtained the transcript afterwards.  I will provide a copy of it to the Deputy.  Mr. Walshe was very clear that the payment was related to the work.  The interviewer <Col N="1176"/>tried to draw him into commenting on the cost, the amount of the payment and the previous proposal put forward by the IFA.  He alluded to the fact that there had been a proposal, but he reiterated clearly that his understanding was that the payment was related to the work.  That being the case, I cannot put a figure on the work until it is costed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot stop members of the media writing whatever they want to write.  Every Deputy in this House knows that.  However, they cannot control what is said when we speak about issues related to the media.  I did not issue any statement on this matter at the time of the meeting.  I have done a number of interviews and I have reiterated that the basis of discussions was on the cost of doing the work.  If there is no cost to maintain a stretch of 300 m because it is self-containing, then there is no cost.  However, if a swampy bit of land needs continuous maintenance, such as filling it with gravel, then there is a cost.  I do not see why the farmer should lose money to maintain it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot answer for the spin that is put on things in the media.  The interview with Mr. P&aacute;draig Walshe reinforces the point I have made in this House.  He was clear and I am clear that this is a payment related to the actual cost of doing the work.  I have not put a cost of &euro;15 million on it and, to be honest, I do not have &euro;15 million to spend in the manner suggested.  However, it is vital that we have well maintained walkways available nationally and that they are maintained on an ongoing basis.  Someone should be there to resolve any problem that arises, be it people leaving litter behind them, breaking styles or whatever.  This will be done on a cost basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for some aspects of the Minister&rsquo;s answer.  It was also stated in the media that it is hoped that many of these walkways could be in greater use by the start of the 2007 tourist season.  Can the Minister comment on that point?  As January is just around the corner, does he accept that the criteria for whatever scheme he puts in place need to be available to the public as soon as possible?  Final decisions need to be made and the House should be informed of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much more work going on behind the scenes than people realise.  As I outlined when I launched the report at a meeting of Comhairle na Tuaithe at the ploughing championships, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been working on getting agreement on a series of walks.  It has also outlined the required works that need to be done in many cases.  The option to use the rural social scheme is a very live one because many farmers are not particularly interested in doing it.  Some of them have too much work and they would rather local farmers did it through the rural social scheme.  We are still in line to achieve our objective and I hope we can do this with F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the new year.</P><Col N="1177"/>
        <P>Many of these walks do not need a great amount of work &mdash; just signage and bits and pieces here and there.  Many of them are over open countryside and people often do not want the walkway to be very developed.  The international experience has been that they often want the obstructions made surmountable rather than removed.  They are not looking for a walkway that is a pathway.  In other words, they want to walk over the mountains.  I am fairly confident we can deliver on that aspect.</P>
        <P>I also discussed with the IFA the unsatisfactory situation where people access mountains and hills through enclosed land by going over field gates and across fields.  We will try to get local solutions to the problem of accessing a hill through a little passageway without going through someone&rsquo;s field that might have cattle or crops in it.  That would ease many of the difficulties that were there in the past.  If I had an open mountain and a closed field, I would not consider them as the same thing.  In legal terms they are the same, but in practical terms they are very different.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his views on whether the RAPID programme has received sufficient resources to allow it to fulfil its mandate towards Ireland&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities; his further views on whether a new programme is required to target the small number of areas here where deep-seated poverty remains a serious problem; if he is considering the introduction of such a new initiative; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[42849/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The RAPID programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated RAPID areas.  In addition, RAPID priority status was recently extended to Ballyfermot.  My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme.  It is a matter for each Department to respond to issues of funding within its area of responsibility.</P>
        <P>I introduced the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004.  Under these schemes, my Department directly funds schemes to provide playgrounds, improve traffic measures, improve health facilities, provide CCTV, support sporting organisations as well as improve local authority housing estates and flat complexes.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;11 million was committed to projects identified in co-operation with the local communities in 2006.  The evaluation of the programme published on 1 June last indicates that the <Col N="1178"/>experience of the RAPID programme has been very positive in many areas.  The evaluator concluded that substantial progress had been made in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in implementing important local projects in response to those needs.  The evaluator stated that the leverage schemes appear to have secured a greater &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo; from local stakeholders and were facilitating further activity at local level.  The report also identifies strengths and weaknesses of the programme and proposes 25 recommendations.  Work is advancing on implementing these recommendations.</P>
        <P>The RAPID area implementation team, AIT, structure has allowed for effective engagements with the local communities and provided community representatives with greater opportunities to work with the local authorities and statutory agencies in identifying the problems that affect their areas.  Matters requiring attention have been identified and prioritised for funding.  There is widespread agreement that local consultation has played a key role in supporting statutory agencies in developing appropriate responses.  Community representatives are supported in working in their immediate neighbourhoods to ensure deeper and wider involvement of the community with RAPID and the statutory agencies.</P>
        <P>We should build on the successes of the RAPID programme rather than introduce a new one.  The achievements of the local structures established under RAPID should be acknowledged from the point of view both of the physical transformation that has begun to take shape in RAPID areas and the improved levels of community involvement and confidence in the process.  The AITs provide a solid basis for moving forward with the programme.  There is of course room for improvement in how the members of the AITs are supported and how their roles can be reinforced and developed.  This is something I am working to improve in co-operation with the AITs and the national monitoring committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that a major problem exists and is concentrated in a number of areas, where there is inter-generational poverty?  The parents of the children of the poor were themselves poor and all the indications are that their children will be poor because no effective initiatives are being taken.  I am not saying it is widespread, but there are areas around the country in which this phenomenon is concentrated.  The Minister indicated that there is no intention to introduce a new scheme.  I would point out that the promised &euro;2 billion that was to be fast-tracked into the RAPID did not happen, to put it mildly, and that essentially this year&rsquo;s Estimates for his Department indicate a 1% increase in terms of the RAPID funding.  As he pointed out, he has the central role as regards RAPID. </P>
        <P>The Labour Party recently published a policy document, entitled A Fair Deal: Fighting Poverty <Col N="1179"/>and Exclusion.  Basically, there is a commitment in it that the Labour Party in Government would commit no less than 5% of the next national development plan to this fair deal in terms of addressing poverty and exclusion.  However, the Minister is saying he has no intention of doing anything extra as regards these areas where there is multifaceted poverty, whether through low incomes, poor educational attainment, poor housing or employment prospects, a high level of anti-social behaviour, drug abuse or the like.  Has he no intention of taking any initiative &mdash; that is what I heard him say &mdash; to introduce a new programmes to deal with these problems in an effective way so that the children in these areas are not sentenced to replicating the manner in which their parents have lived their lives?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I should be interested to know which of the four to six areas the Deputy believes do not display all the characteristics he mentioned.  As far as I am concerned all the areas involved in the RAPID programme have been found through independent analysis to display all the characteristics as regards the problems of inter-generational disadvantage and so on.  They would not be RAPID areas, otherwise.  Some people are suggesting that I should abandon the RAPID programme and the four to six areas and pick a much small number.  I am interested to hear the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestions about the areas he believes do not need the support of the RAPID programme.  It is very unlikely, however, that I might agree with him that any of them does not.  In fact, the demand from areas not included in RAPID suggests that many of them exhibit these particular manifestations and should be included, too &mdash;  rather than shedding any of the RAPID areas.  The leverage fund is not what RAPID is about, but is just a minuscule part of the programme.  I decided, and it was well received, that there were some minor issues that might be dealt with by that type of funding, which would involve leveraging out funding from other Departments and dealing with matters at a local level, rather than big plans being sent to Dublin to erect a piece of pavement or do some estate enhancement &mdash; and it has been very successful.  The AITs uniformly report that this initiative has been successful.  </P>
        <P>We have discussed the allegation that somebody promised &euro;2 billion.  I cannot find any reference to that in any documentation I have inherited in the Department.  I do not know how often I must reiterate this, but if someone can show me where &euro;2 billion was promised, I shall be very grateful because I have all the press releases and there is no mention of it.  What is true, however, is that there is an enormous amount of money in the national development plan for social inclusion.  That money has been spent and will continue to be spent.  Again, as I have indicated, the leverage fund is small.  At one <Col N="1180"/>stage a few months ago, I reported that a total spend was reported to my Department under the RAPID process in the area of more than &euro;300 million.  The big spend relates directly to line Departments giving priority to these areas.  That is as it was meant to be from the start.  Items such as the dormant accounts and the leverage funds were additional extras devised well after the programme had been launched.</P>
        <P>I met recently with all of the community representatives at a conference in Dublin of the RAPID AITs and it was one of the most fruitful and positive meetings I have attended.  They were highly interactive and had numerous very good suggestions.  The one thing impressed on me that day, however, was that they believe RAPID is making a difference, that it is a long-haul initiative, and that they were <i>ad idem</i> with me, in so far as I could make out, that building on the present programme was much better than what had happened in the past.  In the past a programme might be put in place and miracle results were expected overnight.  Then it was scrapped and another was put in place, which was also scrapped.  The conference was very positive about my thesis to the effect that a programme must be left in place for 20 years with assurances underpinning it as a long-term initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has stated that no &euro;2 billion was promised on the record.  If that is the case, how much money was promised?  It was disingenuous of him to suggest that I was proposing that the RAPID programme should be done away with.  Labour Party policy is to go for &euro;3.5 billion with special emphasis being put on those regions within the RAPID areas in which the problems are particularly concentrated.  That is what is being proposed in the Labour Party document.  Incidentally, the preparatory work has been done and the Labour Party is not suggesting we reinvent the wheel.  It is a question of putting the money in place to implement the proposals and do what needs to be done.  It is an issue of resources and the Labour Party is promising that in government it will do that resourcing. </P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s line of argument is disingenuous, but I am intrigued to know, if &euro;2 billion was not promised prior to the last election, how much was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot find any record of a figure being put on it.  As we said all along it was a matter of the re-prioritisation of existing national development plan moneys.  This is what is written in the press releases.  I assure the Deputy that a new national development plan is under development and the entire issue of social inclusion obviously will be part of it, just as it was in its predecessor.</P>
        <P>The Deputy appears to be suggesting that we should have RAPID areas and super-RAPID areas, which is an interesting idea.  Tomorrow, I will meet representatives of the RAPID groups <Col N="1181"/>in an open forum, as I do once every six months.  It would be interesting to put the proposal to them, to ascertain whether they believe there should be RAPID and super-RAPID areas and whether I should differentiate between them.  In some ways, we already do this to an extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy does not intend to take all the moneys for urban renewal, educational disadvantage, health and other issues from the line Departments and put them into the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  One of the Deputy&rsquo;s party&rsquo;s spokespersons suggested that all rural matters should be removed from this Department.  It was suggested that the old Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands should be reassembled and that the community portfolio should be scattered to the four winds.  I return to the point that the major expenditure must be done by the line Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 73 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts under the initial round of funding were a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts.  Under this round, the board approved 521 projects for funding totalling slightly more than &euro;60 million.  To date, approximately &euro;29 million of the &euro;60 million approved has been paid over to groups, of which &euro;4 million was paid in 2004, &euro;8 million in 2005 and &euro;17 million in 2006.  It is anticipated that the remaining &euro;31 million will be disbursed during 2007 and beyond.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the new amended legislation in 2005, decisions on disbursements are now made by the Cabinet following a transparent process.  In accordance with the legislation, the Government approved the allocation of &euro;60 million from the fund in 2006 for the following purposes: &euro;24 million to support projects tackling economic and social disadvantage; &euro;18 million towards projects tackling educational disadvantage; and &euro;18 million towards projects assisting persons with a disability.</P>
        <P>To date in 2006, under the economic and social disadvantage category, the Government has approved funding of &euro;17.5 million in support of 342 projects.  In respect of the remaining funding measures under the economic and social disadvantage category, as well as measures relating to educational disadvantage and people with disabilities, further Government decisions can be expected in early 2007.</P>
        <P>The rural social scheme, RSS, was launched two years ago to provide an income supplement to small farmers and part-time fishermen.  A total of &euro;32.4 million has been allocated to date from the dormant accounts fund to part-finance the RSS, of which &euro;10 million was allocated in 2004, &euro;6.4 million in 2005 and &euro;16 million in 2006.</P>
        <P>The priorities to be supported from dormant accounts next year are currently under consideration.  In this regard, the legislation requires the Minister to consult other appropriate Ministers for the purpose of developing a proposal for submission to the Government for approval.  This process is well under way and the intention is to submit a proposal early next year concerning the 2007 round of funding.</P>
        <P>As for the amount that is expected to be available over the next five years, Members will be aware that the legislation provides for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance <Col N="1183"/>undertakings of moneys in dormant accounts into the fund.  Since the establishment of the fund in May 2003, a total of &euro;373 million has been transferred, of which &euro;108 million has been reclaimed.  At this juncture, it is difficult to say what the expected inflows to the fund will be on an annual basis.  These details will only become available as the funds are actually transferred by financial institutions, which occurs once a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his fairly comprehensive reply.  I am almost shocked that almost &euro;400 million has already been transferred from these accounts to the Exchequer and that &euro;108 million has been reimbursed.  This constitutes a huge sum of money.</P>
        <P>The funds are paid out under various headings to several areas of social deprivation.  Does it all go through the Minister&rsquo;s office, or is it allocated to different Departments in which the decisions are then made?  For example, if one wishes to apply to this scheme to develop something like a health centre in a particular locality, to whom does one apply?  Does the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Finance have ultimate responsibility?  Is a single Minister responsible for distributing the entire amount?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the amount being huge, initially, some major payments were made.  Subsequently, the fund was extended from financial institutions to encompass insurance companies, An Post and similar bodies.  Hence, there were some very significant once-off inflows.  In future, the amount of money accruing to the fund may not be so dramatic.  I believe more people will reclaim their moneys as the accounts in question will only have become dormant recently and will not extend back 40 years.  Perhaps &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million will accrue per year, with approximately &euro;20 million flowing out on an ongoing basis.  However, it will take a year or two before accurate figures in this regard can be compiled.</P>
        <P>While the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is the lead Department, every decision regarding dormant accounts now goes before the Cabinet.  In respect of the &euro;60 million plan announced earlier this year, the &euro;24 million allocated under economic and social disadvantage falls mainly under the aegis of this Department.  A further &euro;18 million was allocated under educational disadvantage and &euro;18 million under disabilities, which is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>However, all applications go before the Cabinet.  The Deputy will have noted the various schemes announced by the Department during the year, all of which go before the Government when they are being independently assessed.  One of the questions concerned the plan for next year, which will be approved by the Government.  The <Col N="1184"/>individual sums of money go into the Votes of different Departments.  While some of it goes to this Department, money for educational or disability-related projects would be transferred to a different Department&rsquo;s Vote.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is the lead Department and takes the proposals to the Cabinet.  However, everything is agreed at that level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>To what extent does the Department keep statistics regarding the geographical distribution of the funding?  This will be of great interest to many Members who wish to ensure the funding is spread proportionately nationwide in a fair and even manner.  Moreover, to what extent have decisions on funding been made already with regard to 2007?  How much of the funding in question is likely to be paid out before 30 June 2007?  Anticipating such decisions would also be useful to Members.</P>
        <P>I suggest that what the Minister of State described as an open and accountable system was argued against in this Chamber by Opposition Members, who would continue to so do.  I accept the administration of the scheme in respect of informing Members of advertisements for funding allocations and the natures of the subsequent decisions made.  However, my experience has been that, as individuals, Members have few powers of persuasion regarding how eventual allocation decisions are made or whether the Government is reconsidering how decisions are made in respect of allocations from the dormant accounts fund.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no data to hand regarding geographic spread.  Incidentally, however, some funding was announced last weekend regarding older people&rsquo;s facilities and I happened to perform a minor analysis on the allocation.  When considered from the perspective of geographic spread, it was not carried out fairly.  This pertains to independent assessment because if it was in my hands, or those of any other politician, a geographic spread would have been much more likely.  If one looks at the analysis of what we announced at the weekend, which is on the website, there was one county, not a very large county, in which 17 different groups received funding.  It was not in my constituency or in that of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Kerry.  I looked at the list with a particular Deputy and there was none from his constituency.  I checked up on it and found there had been no applications from that midlands county.  If a politician had his or her hands over all of this, we would be much more likely to look at how our colleagues might be influenced by it. <Col N="1185"/> If one looks at the funding measure for older people, one can see that it was not a political input.</P>
        <P>Some counties, for whatever reason, have a better structure of community and voluntary organisations.  The word must get out or else they have better partnerships who guide them on how to complete an application.  I do not have exact data, but I saw it at the weekend.</P>
        <P>These programmes are being announced all the time.  Of this year&rsquo;s ones, there is still the one on IT to which I referred in the reply and the one for equipment for youth groups and scouts.  Even within our own segment, the one on alcohol and all those advertised during the year will be announced early in the new year.</P>
        <P>Then we had our overall flagship project.  The Department of Health and Children is looking after the disabilities programme, the closing date for which was this month.  The Department of Education and Science has not got very far yet with its project.  Decisions are being rolled out all the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that under the old regime the <i>modus operandi</i> on disbursements was that at the end of every year there would be an annual report showing where all the money went under different headings.  Can we expect an annual report on how these funds are disbursed throughout the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  There are data in the reply on the different categories to date &mdash; the number of projects and total amounts in the cases of the RAPID areas, support for vulnerable immigrants, support for the suicide prevention programme, supports for offenders and ex-offenders, and supports for older people.  We listed the seven or eight headings we would address during the year.  Those five have been announced and the other two or three are still being processed.  All that information and all the decisions are available on the website.  There will be complete data for anybody who wants it.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Gogarty</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the timeframe for the delivery of the road improvements recently announced under the local improvement scheme in County Cork; and the way he will ensure that there will not be a repeat in delays in the delivery of improvements as previously encountered under the scheme. </Quest>
        <QRef>[42919/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2006, for every &euro;2 spent by local authorities on local improvements schemes, LIS, in CL&Aacute;R areas on non-public roads, my Department is providing an additional &euro;1 from CL&Aacute;R funding for works on further LIS roads within the CL&Aacute;R areas.  This, in effect, will increase investment on LIS roads in these areas <Col N="1186"/>by 50%.  The projects are selected by the local authorities.</P>
        <P>I allocated &euro;653,013 to Cork County Council to carry out works on 20 roads in CL&Aacute;R areas in County Cork in 2006.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that my Department has no input into the selection, or the timeframe for delivery, of these projects which is a matter for the local authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his answer.  Does his Department subsequently seek such information?  It is important in allocating the funding that there is an awareness of public accountability on how and where it was spent.  For instance, how much road improvement does &euro;653,000 buy in County Cork and where in County Cork was the work eventually done by the county council?  If that information is not being sought it is a serious deficiency.  I speak also as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Even though the sums are small, the point of the scheme is that the small allocation can have a greater effect because it is being better targeted, but we still must know where and how it is targeted.</P>
        <P>Can further information be got on how access has been improved in these areas because the difficulty reported is that these are roads that access facilities such as cemeteries and old routes to remote beaches, and improving them also improves access to these communities by visitors, resulting in an economic benefit.  I ask this question not only for accounting of the money spent but for an analysis on behalf of the Department of the economic impact of that money because it is important to know how successful is such a programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Boyle misunderstands fundamentally one aspect of CL&Aacute;R, that is, that CL&Aacute;R provides money to accelerate existing programmes and does not make up new rules for the main schemes.  The people who lay down the rules for LIS are the officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  They give lumps of money to local authorities to carry out LIS and give directions on how projects should be selected.  We operate the exact same rules &mdash; we cannot operate to any other rules.  In the final analysis, it is up to the local authority, which is a public body in its own right, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that this represents value for money.</P>
        <P>The selection of the roads is a matter for the county council but it does so according to the guidelines of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  They are the exact same guidelines that apply when the same county council is undertaking LIS road works with money provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Govern<Col N="1187"/>ment, and my understanding is that the reporting arrangements would be the same.</P>
        <P>In our case, we get a list of roads and the amount of money to be spent on each road.  The method of calculating the cost and the amount of roads done are the exact same ones used by that local authority in spending the money of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the exact same criteria is applied.</P>
        <P>T&eacute;ann muid &oacute; thaobh amh&aacute;in go taobh eile.  We go from one extreme to the other.  We can spend all our time doing economic assessments, but there are certain things in this life one does because they need doing.  I do not care, within reason, what it costs where there is a widow living in a house on an impassable road.  Although there is economic analysis, at the end of the day one either makes up one&rsquo;s mind that one will repair the road.  What happens if the economic appraisal advises not to repair the road?  I do not think any of us would leave the widow in that situation.</P>
        <P>It is important that criteria are laid down for schemes.  I firmly believe in ensuring value for money and a high standard of work from local authorities.  While, no doubt, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government ensures this is done, the one great brake on irresponsible LIS spending is that the local people must make a contribution, of 10% in some cases and 15% in others cases.  Local people would not spend 10% of the cost of repairing a road which is not of major benefit to them and, therefore, the scheme is inherently sound in value for money terms.</P>
        <P>For those of us who live in rural parts of the country, the amounts of money involved are tiny compared to the benefit to be got from sc&eacute;im na mb&oacute;ithre &aacute;ise and the LIS.  As a rural Deputy, the generality of these schemes represent fantastic value for money and they are a small part of public infrastructure towards which there is a direct local contribution.  I know of no other roads towards which one is obliged to make a direct local contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Minister misunderstood me.  I am asking not that analysis be done prior to projects, but that a general analysis be done subsequently to ensure the money is creating maximum impact.  I am making the opposite argument, that because the sums and the projects are so small, often the hap&rsquo;orth of tar &mdash; the additional money &mdash; needed to meet many of these basic human needs the Minister highlighted is not provided due to the lack of proper analysis.  I am asking that the Department put in place mechanisms to ensure that the small-scale projects do not fail as a result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We are back again at the beginning of the story.  On the issue of undertaking an overall analysis of value for money, <Col N="1188"/>there are ongoing value for money audits in all Departments and, I presume, in local authorities.  Therefore, it is a for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to carry out a value for money audit on the scheme.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is the begetter of the scheme, controls its conditions and is responsible for its rules.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy wants to know whether a value for money audit on this scheme has been undertaken, he should table a question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  That is not my Department&rsquo;s role.  I do not make the rules of the scheme and I am not responsible for the overall policy issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is responsible for spending his Department&rsquo;s money.  The whole point of Question Time is that we are here to ask the Minister questions about how he spends his Department&rsquo;s money and determine if it is spent properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  Constitutionally, Ministers are collectively responsible for all Departments.  The idea of running Government as if it were a series of parallel independent republics is not only stupid, but it is fundamentally unconstitutional.  The collective nature of Government is fundamental to the Constitution.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific issue, the role rests with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Why would I duplicate the work of a ministerial colleague when this is a single Government?  It would make no sense.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 51, 53 and 88 together.</P>
        <P>I have been aware for some time of the anecdotal evidence of increased cocaine prevalence and, for this reason, last year I asked the national advisory committee on drugs and the national drugs strategy team to prepare a briefing paper on cocaine.  This paper was presented at the last interdepartmental group on drugs meeting in September 2006.  The paper did not involve new research, rather it arose from an examination of sources such as crime data, drug seizure figures and data from hospital and drug services.  While more detailed evidence on cocaine will arise from the drug prevalence survey, which is currently in progress nationwide, available indicators point to increased use of cocaine.</P>
        <P>The Departments and agencies listed as being responsible for the implementation of the recommendations of the briefing paper have been asked to give their reactions to the relevant suggestions and it is proposed to discuss their responses further at tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting of the interdepartmental group on drugs.  The recommendation on dedicated cocaine clinics will be looked at in this context, as will the issue of the stigma that many middle class people feel about receiving drug treatment.  However, in the broader context, I believe we should work towards having drug services that can cater for the individual problem drug user, regardless of the drugs they use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>One of my questions related to the Citywide survey on cocaine.  It confirms what the Minister of State has said, namely, there is clearly a growth in drugs use.  The 2004 survey found that 14% of projects reported seeing clients with what they described as problematic cocaine use.  However, 62% of projects are now reporting such problematic cocaine use.  Two years ago, 92.6% of projects reported existing clients were using cocaine.  This survey has shown there is a huge growth in cocaine use.</P>
        <P>There is a lack of proper analysis of the information available.  There clearly is a gap between what some community groups are doing and what we seem to have officially.  The worrying thing for community activists or those involved in the anti-drugs campaign over the years is that the problem is worsening.  The survey discusses the emergence of crystal meth and ten projects report on the local availability of crack cocaine.  However, the Garda does not seem to have information on the spread of crack cocaine.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State accept that the survey is useful and timely?  Does he believe this data is vital to combating drugs?  Some 62% of projects are seeing clients for whom cocaine is <Col N="1190"/>their main drug.  Half the projects have recorded an increase in cocaine use among clients; one project in north Dublin recorded four cocaine-related deaths.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State accept that we also need to look at so-called recreational drugs?  Does he accept that alternatives, such as caf&eacute;s or youth clubs, must be provided for young people?  It is vital that groups setting up such facilities are funded by the Department.  Does the Minister agree that facilities such as these should receive State funding?  Is the Department currently funding any alcohol and drug free cafes?  These provide an alternative to hanging around on street corners.  Such a youth facility operates in Killinarden and a huge number of young people use it, enjoy the atmosphere in it, and are involved in positive activities such as education.</P>
        <P>When will the decision be made regarding the cocaine projects?  The biggest problem is that the Government, and probably the Minister of State himself, is still unsure as to how to tackle the problem.  Anecdotal evidence from across the country suggests drug use is worsening.  How will we respond to this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his questions and know he understands the problem.  I do not disagree with anything contained in the Citywide survey &mdash; it is a reflection of attitudes on the ground.  We are working in partnership with community groups and the local drugs taskforces.  Approximately &euro;70 million is being spent annually on projects that were recommended and suggested at community level.  While we take on board their suggestions about what is required, the drugs problem has not gone away and will not go away.  It is a case of trial and error, and if anyone has the total solution they should let us know what it is.</P>
        <P>The point made in the paper produced by the advisory committee on drugs and the drugs strategy team is that many of the available services &mdash; there are up to 700 people working in the areas of prevention and treatment &mdash; were tailored to the heroin problem.  There is a degree of truth in the assertion that many of the services are very opiate-focused.  We need to adjust and tweak those, or set up new services to attract people with cocaine problems.  This is the difficulty.  As the Deputy has mentioned, cocaine use is not just happening in the traditional, disadvantaged areas; it is also being used in many middle class areas.  It is difficult to get those people to avail of treatment.  They are much slower to realise they have a problem.  They think recreational cocaine use is for the film star set and no health difficulties are attached.  This is entirely untrue.  Cocaine is a very dangerous drug and can lead to mental and physical health problems, including heart attacks and strokes.  It is difficult to get that through to people.  Many people are reluctant to admit they are &ldquo;druggies&rdquo; and avail of services.  It is similar to the problem with <Col N="1191"/>alcoholics.  We could cope better and tailor services to people&rsquo;s needs if we could make them realise and admit they have a problem.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The young people&rsquo;s fund has provided many services such as facilities and youth workers.  More than &euro;120 million has been spent in this area, mainly in the Dublin suburbs, including Tallaght, in recent years.  An allocation was also announced in recent weeks.  They are providing an alternative and giving young people something else to do.  At-risk teenagers are particularly targeted by these programmes.  While much is being done, the problem is shifting from heroin use, where numbers have stabilised, to cocaine.  However, they do not come forward so we are considering what services can be offered to convince them to cop on and realise they are building up a problem within themselves.  Then we must provide the appropriate treatment.</P>
        <P>The pilot project in Tallaght about which Deputy Crowe spoke is still being evaluated.  Its funding will continue but it is very much a pilot project.  We want to build on it, tweak it where necessary and get it to adhere to best practice before it becomes mainstream.  Reports on the project are good and it may be replicated in other areas in the future.  Its funding will continue until the evaluation is completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 18 will be discussed together.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="2">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">1.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of abolishing the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the Minister is well aware, I have always unashamedly articulated the plight and championed the cause of carers, of which there are 150,000 working in their own homes and contributing to the mission statements and long-held objectives of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive to keep the people for whom they care within their own environment, where they feel happiest in the company of their own families, neighbourhood and community.  It is a laudable objective for the achievement of which we must put in place the appropriate structural changes at policy level.</P><Col N="1193"/>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>In this context people work 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 52 weeks a year and it would be churlish, not to say nakedly political, not to acknowledge what the Minister has done.  He has taken significant elements of the Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs report of November 2003 on the position of full-time carers, which made 15 recommendations.  He has extended the period of carer&rsquo;s benefit from 15 months to two years and, for the first time in the latest budget, abolished the outdated rule that a person could not receive two social welfare benefits.  The fact that a person on a widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s pension can now also receive 50% of the carer&rsquo;s allowance is a welcome and progressive step and acknowledges the reality of life for many people.</P>
        <P>I remember articulating this issue previously with the story of an elderly widow who had looked after a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome for 25 or 30 years and who was only entitled to a widow&rsquo;s pension.  Despite carer&rsquo;s allowance being tailor-made for her, not only in terms of an income support but as an acknowledgement of her role in ensuring her young son remained with her, she was not entitled to it, so the measure is extremely important in that context.</P>
        <P>The amendment I have tabled proposes that the Minister consider the cost of abolishing the means test.  As I said last night, our social welfare system is heavily dependent on means-testing.  Some of the many means tests are very complex and not as transparent as they should be.  Many are a labyrinth of rules and regulations.  They are very time-consuming and costly and officials who carry out the work would probably admit they would be better trying to achieve policy objectives elsewhere.  The abolition of the means test would reduce net costs by allowing officials to be deployed on other work and by saving on travel costs incurred during the course of an assessment.</P>
        <P>The crudest cost-benefit analysis would show abolition to be a positive option from every possible perspective.  The National Economic and Social Forum has indicated the amount saved to society by family home carers who work without complaint and who only desire help at critical times, a need the Minister has met by extending the respite care grant and increasing it to &euro;300.  The Minister does not strangle a good scheme with the cords of bureaucracy and that is important.  There are many schemes and most have worthy objectives but, from the outset, they become strangled and emasculated by a labyrinth of bureaucracy, killing the value of a scheme before it begins.</P>
        <P>The Minister has loosened the cords from the respite care grant and it is important that, as its availability is widened and its eligibility thresholds lowered, it is advertised so the people who need it most are made aware of it.  The Minister always says he tries to act in a targeted and focused way.  I accept that his argument cannot be discounted at the stroke of a pen but requires evaluation.  In the context of care worth &euro;2 <Col N="1194"/>billion, a great saving to the State, another &euro;150 million, following the abolition of the means test, for people spending a minimum number of hours caring for someone would be money well spent.  Where otherwise would we get the nursing homes?</P>
        <P>I strongly support massive investment in the public infrastructure to provide State-run nursing homes.  I would double the funding for beds for St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in Mullingar, which I mentioned earlier and which has very good staff, attendants and doctors and provides a lovely environment in which to live.  The number of beds we would have to provide through private nursing homes and State-run institutions would be colossal.</P>
        <P>The Minister might say the universality principle is a long way from Labour Party ideals but this is fundamental Labour Party thinking.  Domiciliary care, primary education and the over-70s medical card are not strangled by income-related conditions.  The abolition of means testing is a very important concept and we are four square behind it.  I am very proud it was a kernel of the recommendations of the all-party Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As chairperson, it was good to achieve an all-party consensus.  When the matter is explained to the public, they will agree with us on what the recommendation means to them.  I acknowledge what the Minister has done in respect of carers in that he is one of the first Ministers to take the matter on board and make significant changes, but this change would have a long-term positive effect and be cherished.</P>
        <P>I attended the briefing given by Mr. Enda Egan of the Carers Association in Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel and listened to a lady from Waterford.  In a non-political way, the association made the same points as the Minister.  I will give him credit for that because, when people do something well, they are entitled to acknowledgement.  The woman said that she has had enough of the situation and that if she is &euro;10 over the threshold, she will not get the payment.  For her, the abolition of the means test was key to the issue.  I took solace from her case, which she made in a cogent manner, but some people question the situation.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party believes that this is matter is so important that it will be part of our electoral platform and will not be reneged upon.  This worthwhile issue is dear to me.  Given that cost benefit analyses did not cast some recent expenditure in the same positive light as this &euro;145 million expenditure, it is time to take the quantum leap of abolishing means testing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to speak to both amendments.  Fine Gael has carefully examined the abolition of the means test and, like everyone else, has recognised the invaluable work of carers.  The discussion on amendment No. 1 is timely, given that the Government unveiled its policy for <Col N="1195"/>care of the elderly a number of days ago.  I do not know the experiences of other Deputies, but the number of calls to my office made by family members and people worried and angered by that policy is unprecedented.</P>
        <P>While I will not go as far as Deputy Penrose and suggest the abolition of the means test, we must acknowledge the work of carers.  The Minister has gone a certain way towards doing so, but we must go further.  When one balances the cost of what could be possible, such as encouraging more people to care for their loved ones in their homes, with the cost of putting people in nursing homes, there is no argument.  All Deputies agree that the best place for an older person is in his or her home.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has increased the carer&rsquo;s allowance personal rate to &euro;200 per week in the case of caring for one person.  Yesterday, Deputy Kenny cited the example of someone who is paid &euro;100 per night to sit with an older person and do nothing more than ensure that the person does not fall over.  These are the types of costs involved, but many carers do this type of work 24 hours per day, seven days per week and 365 days per year.  If the older person must enter a nursing home, community hospital or elsewhere, the cost incurred by the State will be considerable, but the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s proposal to pay from beyond the grave is complicated and upsetting.</P>
        <P>The Government should examine the option of the carer in the home.  People would probably take on caring responsibilities if they were paid in their own right, which would go 90% of the way towards abolishing the means test.  Retired nurses may be willing to become the carers of their neighbours if they were paid in their own right.  However, as their spouses&rsquo; incomes are also assessed, means testing would disqualify them from involvement and we would lose a significant opportunity.</P>
        <P>As the Opposition cannot propose amendments that would incur charges on the State, we must table ridiculous proposals regarding reporting to the House.  While there is a cost implication to the abolition of the means test, it would be balanced by what could be achieved via identifying suitable carers.  For example, there must be many retired nurses in our communities who could be encouraged to become carers in their areas.  We could also encourage family members who do not currently provide care for various reasons.  We should examine this option carefully.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s statement this morning on how the matter pertinent to amendment No. 18 has been discussed by the social partners, who are the real Houses of the Oireachtas.  Sometimes, I wonder which group is in charge, the social partners or the Oireachtas.  It is a serious issue that we seem to be told what to do by the social partners.  Democracy is not well <Col N="1196"/>served by such an about-turn in events.  We have been elected to represent all of the people and, while I acknowledge the role of social partnership, I take issue with Ministers informing the House that the Oireachtas must accept something decided on by the social partners and the Government.  It is a fundamentally undemocratic way of doing business.</P>
        <P>However, given that this issue was not discussed here, I welcome that it was discussed at social partnership level.  According to figures provided by the Carers Association, up to 3,000 children take care of older people, siblings and other family members.  In recent years, I have often asked for a Government response to this issue, but there has been none and the matter has been ignored.  I have challenged the Ministers for Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs in this regard.</P>
        <P>I taught for a number of years.  If a child goes to school in the morning with that type of worry and responsibility on his or her shoulders, he or she cannot study, participate or socialise properly.  Socialising is particularly important for teenagers.  The child will feel apart from his or her friends and peers and his or her education, social lives and health can suffer.  I have called for the issue to be examined and supports to be put in place in homes and schools so that teachers and home school liaisons who become aware of children&rsquo;s problems and responsibilities can link up with community welfare officers, public health nurses and so on to lift some of the children&rsquo;s burdens.  This reasonable measure has been taken in other countries.  I invite the Minister to examine what is being done in Australia, which is far ahead of us.</P>
        <P>Why has Fianna F&aacute;il not examined the matter?  Is it because there are no votes to be had from under 18 year olds?  I am disappointed that nothing has been done and that the debate has turned into a talking shop.  I have been involved in this issue for a number of years.</P>
        <P>We must do more for carers.  While I acknowledge what has been done, more is left to do.  Nothing has been done to help young carers.  That is why both amendments were tabled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Penrose, Se&aacute;n Ryan and Stanton, in whose names are the amendments, for their contribution.  I have acknowledged that Deputy Penrose has been a long-time campaigner for the removal of the means test for carers.  I squared up to the issue and had a number of sessions with officials, and took much advice.  We considered the issue very carefully and, at the end of that process, I decided to introduce different measures.</P>
        <P>The package for carers in the budget is &euro;107 million and the cost of abolishing the means test is approximately &euro;140 million.  With that kind of money, I could have abolished the means test but I opted instead to do other things which I thought <Col N="1197"/>would be more beneficial in the short term.  The Deputy is aware of those measures.  First, the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for those aged 66 or over has been increased in the Bill by &euro;18 from &euro;200 per week to &euro;218 per week.  Also, the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for those aged under 66 and carer&rsquo;s benefit has increased by &euro;20 from &euro;180 to &euro;200 per week.  That will not pay anyone for doing the caring but it is a contribution towards it.  That increase will cost almost &euro;32 million.  I thought it was necessary to acknowledge the current rate of payment to existing carers.</P>
        <P>I also considered an increase was required to the respite care grant, which is currently &euro;1,200.  I am told this grant is extraordinarily appreciated.  Again, it does not pay a person but it is appreciated as an acknowledgement, which is all it was ever meant to be, and it allows a person to have a break from caring.  It has increased from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500 in just two years.  It is not means tested and is a universal payment.  To that extent, it goes some way to meeting the Deputies&rsquo; request for the removal of the means test.  The increase will cost a further &euro;30 million, so the Deputies can understand how the funds build up.</P>
        <P>I considered that the weekly income disregard for carer&rsquo;s allowance needed to be improved, so it was increased by &euro;30 to &euro;320 per week for a single person and by &euro;60 to &euro;640 per week for a couple.  This will take effect in April, and will have a full year cost of a further &euro;6 million.  I considered that increasing the earnings threshold for entitlement to carer&rsquo;s benefit should also be improved, so we increased it to &euro;320 per week.</P>
        <P>I then had to make a substantial choice.  Taking account of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations, I had either to adopt the half rate proposal or choose a more dramatic abolition of the means test.  It would have been much easier for me to abolish the means test, and much easier to explain, as the method I chose is more complicated.  The cost of introducing a new, additional means tested payment equivalent to up to half of the carer&rsquo;s allowance rate for certain people with another social welfare entitlement comes to almost &euro;57 million.  If I were to remove the means test, I could not have introduced the new payment because to remove the means test would almost certainly eat up the required funds.  I considered the introduction of this measure more urgent for those involved, if less politically dramatic for myself.</P>
        <P>We have squared up to this issue and have been able to abolish the welfare rule that one cannot get two payments.  This means that anybody on a welfare payment &mdash; we have yet to work out many details and I will listen carefully to what colleagues have said, as will my officials, because some of the details are difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave the Minister a bouncer last night.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1198"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy did so.  He posed a few awkward questions last night.  He never gave me an easy one yet.</P>
        <P>We must work out some details but we have provided &euro;57 million to do this.  Most carers are on some form of welfare, whether they are on pensions, lone parent&rsquo;s allowance or other allowances.  As the Deputy knows &mdash; he brought the matter to my attention &mdash; the position previously was that if somebody wanted to become a carer, we, in effect, took away that person&rsquo;s social welfare and instead provided a carer&rsquo;s allowance.  What will happen is that the carer will keep the social welfare payment and will be paid an allowance equivalent to a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  That is not to pay carers for caring but it is the beginning of the process.</P>
        <P>This is a substantial reform in terms of moving away from simply viewing carer&rsquo;s allowance as an income support.  It allows a carer to keep his or her social welfare but acknowledges that he or she is doing the caring, that the State will contribute towards the work and that it appreciates the work.  Some 18,000 people are involved, who will be entitled to an additional &euro;100 per week &mdash; a person on a &euro;200 per week pension will receive &euro;300.</P>
        <P>This is the beginning.  I look forward to working with the carers&rsquo; organisations to develop a strategy for carers.  As we move towards that strategy, those organisations have impressed on me the argument that carers should not be seen as people who just need income support but as people who do a job for which they must receive support.  Caring feeds into the entire health service and takes the pressure off it.  Another small change being made is that recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit who previously received illness benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit will revert to that payment at the same rate as previously paid, if that is more beneficial to them.</P>
        <P>Government, or any kind of office, is about choices.  The choice I made was not that easy.  I considered removing the means test.  I began by wanting to do that but instead I produced a &euro;107 million package, the largest ever, for carers.  To do it in the way I have described was much fairer and more urgent.  Whatever the future of the means test in the long term, it is a subject to which we can return.  I do not have an ideological bent in this regard other than that, in general, I will try to focus taxpayers&rsquo; funds where they are needed.</P>
        <P>In one way, Deputy Penrose is probably correct.  My officials advise me that failing the means test financially is not what is keeping people from caring.  Very few people fail the means test.  However, they do not apply because they do not meet the other condition, which is that they must be available to provide full-time care and attention.  There are not many millionaires available to provide full-time care and attention.  This is why I am mystified at the cost of removing the test, which seems to clash with my previous statement. <Col N="1199"/> Extreme complications arise with regard to domiciliary care allowances.  Only half of the cost of &euro;140 million is related to carer&rsquo;s allowance.  There is a knock-on effect with regard to domiciliary care allowances, which cost a further &euro;70 million to &euro;80 million.  This was the complication which in the end persuaded me not to make this change.  I do not believe many extremely well-off people will become full-time carers as they are more likely to hire someone to support them.  We end up falling back substantially on people on lower incomes who do the caring.  That is why I focused the measure in this way.</P>
        <P>Obviously, I must reject the amendment.  Deputy Stanton is correct that it is a type of <i>pro forma</i> amendment which must be put down to allow discussion.  The Deputies did not intend to put it down in this way, and they never intended me to accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  I am grateful and it would be churlish not to acknowledge that he said in a straight fashion that he gave time to exploring the possibility of abolishing the means test.  He might have had a different view 12 months ago but I have largely convinced him of my rationale for doing this.  It is generally people on low incomes who avail of carer&rsquo;s allowance, not the millionaires, who will buy in expensive care in any case.  If money could keep people alive, they would all would be alive as they have plenty of money.  They will not be at the cutting edge of this matter.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge this issue involves a choice.  The Minister made an argument with which it is hard to take issue, namely, that it would have been politically easier to abolish the means test.  I intend to withdraw the amendment.  However, I would like the Minister to put on his thinking cap about one other proposal.  Perhaps I should not ask him as I will not pay him the same compliment as my constituency colleague did last night.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Deputy Penrose can introduce it in Government next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>A compassionate care benefit scheme was introduced in Canada in 2004 where employees are entitled to receive up to six weeks employment insurance benefits, approximately 55% of their insured earnings support, when they provide care for a gravely ill family member who is at risk of passing on within six months.  This issue is related to the ongoing debate initiated by the Minister for Health and Children.  I will throw this issue into the pot because no party can <Col N="1200"/>address it on its own.  I ask the Minister to consider the introduction of a similar scheme into the social welfare system.  It would be similar to the current maternity leave scheme.  The model is in place and it would affect only six weeks pay.</P>
        <P>As a committee, we are greatly heartened that the Minister made our report a bedrock of his reforms.  Every member, including those in his party, will acknowledge his contribution in that regard.  Printing was the only cost we incurred in producing that report but many reports, which cost millions, gather dust.  I never held Government office but, having attended a number of ministerial offices as part of a delegation, I have seen tomes lying everywhere.  Our report totalled 100 pages and the Minister has achieved more value out of it than anybody else.  Fair play to him for acknowledging the role of the Oireachtas and, in particular, his fellow parliamentarians in producing a good report.  I acknowledge their role as well and I withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that all couples who care for relatives are not millionaires.  The husband works and earns a modest wage while his wife is at home looking after an elderly parent or parent-in-law but she is precluded from the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme other than the respite care grants.  Issues relating to people who are involved in caring and are not supported must be recognised and addressed.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not allude to young carers in his response, although he mentioned them in his contribution on Second Stage.  He said that a group will be established which will examine and report on young carers.  When will the report be made available?  Who will carry it out?  When does he expect action to be taken on foot of such a report, given that this is an urgent issue?  I have tried as best I can to paint a picture of this issue for the Minister and his predecessors.  What discussions has the Minister had with his Cabinet colleagues on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has justified his reason for not accepting the amendment.  While I seldom pay the Minister a compliment, I compliment him on permitting the payment of 50% of the carer&rsquo;s allowance to full-time carers who are in receipt of other social welfare benefits.  Deputy Penrose raised this issue during last year&rsquo;s budget debate but I have raised it during the past ten budget debates with the Minister and his predecessors, Deputies Coughlan and Dermot Ahern, and I was told on every occasion that the issue could not be addressed.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The reason I raised the issue is a case was brought to my attention in my constituency involving a woman who cared for her father-in-law at home.  He was doubly incontinent and bed ridden and her husband had been killed in a road accident.  She subsequently received the widow&rsquo;s pension and she continued to care for her husband&rsquo;s father, but she lost the carer&rsquo;s allowance. <Col N="1201"/> It was the most cruel case I ever came across in my political career.  A month ago I did not intend to stand at the next general election and my political career was due to finish next June but I have decided to run again.  I do not know whether I will be in the House for the next budget and if this is my last budget, I am glad I have achieved this much in my political career.</P>
        <P>The Minister is only conceding a payment equal to 50% of the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  However, his officials are well aware of the case to which I refer because I have raised it many times.  This woman lost her husband, who was a small farmer, and she had to hire somebody to do her meagre farm work because she was a full-time carer to her husband&rsquo;s father in the house.  She was, therefore, penalised in two respects.  Where that happens, a carer who is a social welfare recipient should not lose his or her carer&rsquo;s allowance.  It will not cost the Minister &euro;57 million to address this.  This was a cruel case and this issue will continue to affect carers who lose a spouse because, even with the change the Minister proposes, they will still lose half the carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>I am surprised and disappointed that the change will not be introduced until next September, which is almost a year away.  It is more or less a case of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; where qualifying carers are concerned.  They are being short-changed, although I will not call this mean because the Minister must work out this proposal.  I have given the Government parties plenty of warning about this issue over the past nine budgets.  It is nine years since my constituent lost her husband in a road accident and subsequently lost the carer&rsquo;s allowance because she was in receipt of the widow&rsquo;s pension.  Although I welcome very much the changes the Minister proposes, I am disappointed he is postponing the implementation of this decision until next September.  That is far-fetched, given that a general election will be held before next September.  I would like this change to be implemented before the general election, if possible, for the Minister&rsquo;s sake and mine.</P>

One would think committee work insignificant if one were to judge by the publicity it receives but if this debate has demonstrated one thing, it is the importance of such work.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not change my mind.  I must say I am very satisfied that issues we highlighted <Col N="1202"/>relating to this Bill have been addressed in one manner or another.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, was prepared to listen to us and implement ideas as we put forward general principles as politicians who saw the need for change.  </P>
        <P>In regard to carers, I sat on a committee that spanned the political divide and came forward with recommendations.  We raised the subject of a second payment and were informed by officials and former Ministers that the issue was sacrosanct and could not be addressed.  We have made great progress on the second payment and I compliment the Minister in this regard.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I had to leave when the Minister was halfway through his contribution relating to the category of people covered by the second payment and many people will be curious to know what category is covered.  Does the Minister know when a decision will be made on this matter?  We have made a good deal of progress in this regard and it may be up to another Government, whatever its composition, to take this matter to the next stage.  The Labour Party has always favoured disposing of the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s point on the matter and understand he has given it consideration.  It will fall to the next Government to take a decision on the issue and give full recognition to the role played by carers in society.  In the context of the debate surrounding nursing homes, there will be a greater emphasis on caring in the home and how it is addressed.  I look forward to seeing the progress made in this regard in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1. &mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the redressing the disproportionate loss of income for recipients of social insurance payments to deserted wife where earnings exceed the prescribed amount.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This relates to my contribution on the previous amendment.  On Committee Stage during last year&rsquo;s debate I pointed out to the Minister that, for the previous three years, I had highlighted an anomaly that existed in deserted wife benefit.  The Minister and his officials acknowledged the anomaly but it seemed nothing was being done about it and I threw up my arms in frustration.  I am delighted to now put it on the record that the Minister has made significant moves on deserted wife benefit and I am pleased that I played a significant role in highlighting this anomaly.  Some 9,000 people receive deserted wife benefit and <Col N="1203"/>part of the case that was made was that no means test applied to many payments from the social insurance fund.</P><?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>I am delighted that from May 2007 a new single gross earnings limit of &euro;20,000 will be introduced for recipients of deserted wife benefit which will bring substantial improvements to the lives of over 2,500 people, including constituents who have contacted me welcoming this development.  When a recipient crosses the &euro;20,000 income threshold, that person will receive a transition payment for six months to ease the impact of losing entitlement to the full deserted wife benefit.  However, what would happen if the person lost that job during the six month transition?  Would the person be entitled to receive deserted wife benefit again?  What if a recipient of deserted wife benefit became a carer and wished to revert to deserted wife benefit on the death of the person being cared for?  Is this possible?</P>
        <P>Regarding this amendment, what would be the cost of disposing of income limits entirely and will the Minister consider this as he has already moved in this direction to an extent?  Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to increase the one parent family payment every year?  One of the great anomalies of this payment is that, since it began in 1992, the scale of payments has increased.  I hope those in receipt of this can look forward to annual increases in the payment, mirroring normal increases that occur generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan for moving this amendment.  Almost every Deputy has made representations to me on this issue and I have taken the opportunity presented by the budget to address it.  In case Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan is no longer in this House next year, I acknowledge his efforts in pressing the Select Committee on Social and Family Affairs to make these amendments.  He repeatedly pointed out the anomalies in the deserted wife benefit at meetings of the committee and, along with Deputy Carey, played a direct role in having these changes introduced.  At one stage, I tried my best to avoid meeting either Deputy in the corridors of Leinster House because I was aware they wanted to hold long discussions with me on the issue.</P>
        <P>While I am not entirely satisfied that we have fully addressed the problems, substantial progress has been made.  From May 2007, a new single earnings limit of &euro;20,000 gross will be introduced.  In addition, if a claimant&rsquo;s earnings go above that limit, she will be entitled to a new half rate transitional payment for six months to ease the impact of losing entitlement to the payment.  More than 2,300 claimants will benefit from these provisions at an estimated cost of &euro;1.3 million in a full year.  The budget provided that, from May 2007, the four income bands will be abolished and an upper income limit set at &euro;20,000.  Deserted wife benefit recipients will be able to receive a full payment in accordance with their contributions, up to that <Col N="1204"/>upper income limit.  The scheme remains closed and recipients will no longer qualify for payment when their earnings increase above the upper limit, as is the case for all social welfare schemes.  Currently, some 300 recipients are earning in excess of the current lower income limit of &euro;12,667.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1. &mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on increasing the living alone allowance.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister will be aware my amendment is a formal means of presenting a case.  I have been contacted by several parties, including Age Action Ireland and the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, regarding the fact that the living alone allowance has remained at the same level for a number of years.  They argue that economies of scale obtain where two or more people cohabit because, for example, it is cheaper to buy in bulk or share a taxi.  The living alone allowance was introduced by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor to address that issue.  However, the allowance has remained static, although the Minister will correctly point out that choices must be made in terms of making increases to payments and that the overall package of household benefits should be considered.</P>
        <P>What would be the cost to the Exchequer of an additional &euro;5 to the living alone allowance?  It irritates people that this is the only allowance which has not been increased in several years.  Those who live alone feel forgotten and wonder why they are left to face additional costs.  I am aware I am not in a position to address the issue due to the budgetary implications of doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy noted, this is a matter of choice.  I hope, however, he will accept that I am committed to using active social welfare payments to improve people&rsquo;s lives instead of being a passive provider of allowances.  In that <Col N="1205"/>context, rather than being unable to afford an increase in the living alone allowance, we take the view that it is better to expand the choices available.  If we spend all our resources on increasing the allowance, what happens when people stop living alone?  Their lives are not over if they meet somebody or move in with relatives.  They will want to have that option but they will be faced with the loss of a significant payment if they take it.  This is a sensitive social issue because, while the extra costs of living alone must be acknowledged, one can only go so far in terms of incentivising that form of habitation.  People may end up feeling forced to remain alone because they do not want to lose their benefits.  I argue that, while the same amount of money was spent, it was invested on different ends.  I made the choice to invest the extra funds in State pensions, fuel allowances and other supports for older people.  I made a similar decision in respect of the over-80 allowance to spread funding across the board because it is not a means tested payment.</P>
        <P>Currently, just over 150,000 people are in receipt of this additional payment.  The estimated cost of doubling the current allowance of &euro;7.70 is &euro;61 million, so I thought it better to include that money in the rate.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point, but I sat back and thought about it.  I am not a social engineer and will not become one.  However, I want to ensure that what I do acts as a signal.  Critics will say that is grand but it does not recognise the reality that people must live alone and therefore should get support.  I agree, but the best way I can support them is through increasing the rate directly, which was done strongly this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of a second-tier, employment neutral, child income support payment to target child poverty levels.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have been through these issues in some detail already.  The basic issue here is child poverty, but we are all agreed that some progress has been made although we may not agree on how child poverty is measured.  The Minister made clear this morning that he is not for turning on that.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, there is substantial child poverty in Ireland.  The EU-SILC 2005 data gives a figure of 10% of children.  The Minister has been promising for over two years that he will provide a second tier employment neutral child income <Col N="1206"/>support payment.  His bona fides are good and I know he is genuine about this measure and is working hard towards it, but has run into difficulties on it.  In fairness, for the first time he has increased the child dependant allowance and has amalgamated the three different levels of payments which has made Deputy McGrath very happy.</P>
        <P>We still have an issue with regard to child poverty and still have children in poverty despite all the money available.  Last night I mentioned the disregard towards pensions for tax relief which amounts to &euro;3 billion per year, but that is another issue.  When will the report be available from the ESRI and when will we see action on it?  This matter has been in gestation for two years and it is important we act on it and target child poverty.</P>
        <P>Deputy Penrose and I urged the Minister earlier in the year to increase awareness of the family income supplement, FIS.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment this morning that he would try to link Revenue with FIS in some shape or form.  If this was possible, it would mean that information on people known to the Revenue to be on low incomes could be shared with the Department of Social and Family Affairs so that a top-up payment could be made automatically.  If that was possible, it would be a significant advance and would mean people who do not get the payment because they do not know about it or cannot apply for it would get their payment.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 13 are similar to amendment No. 4 and seek improved early child care income support payments.  No extra payment was made for child care in the budget or by way of social welfare this year.  I acknowledge that a payment of &euro;1,000 was provided for last year.  However, it has not been increased.  The take-up with regard to the &euro;10,000 income disregard provision for tax purposes did not work because it was absolutely miserable.  I suggest to the Minister that child care is one of the most significant costs facing families.  Other EU states are far ahead of us in this regard.  The child care issue did not even get a mention in this year&rsquo;s budget which amazed me.  I expected the early child care supplement to be increased substantially, but that did not happen.</P>
        <P>We need to know the Government&rsquo;s child care policy, which almost seems to be a case of make it up as we go along.  I know we now have a Minister of State with responsibility for children and his position has elevated the issue to a higher level.  While I have put forward these three amendments, I will not press them because of the nature of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I broadly support Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s amendments although he has indicated he will not press them.  The Minister is acutely aware of the issue of child poverty and I do not doubt his bona fides with regard to his efforts to eradicate it.  The eradication of child poverty is a challenging objective and cannot be achieved eas<Col N="1207"/>ily.  There is no one size measure to fit all that will deal with child poverty, which is part of the problem.  If money alone could address the issue, the Minister would have made a good stab at it.  Coming into an election year, the Government would have been very eager to obliterate the issue from the political agenda and not have people like us returning to the issue on a recurring basis.</P>
        <P>I will not address the issues of back to school clothing and footwear allowances etc.  The Minister would obviously say those allowances are significant as is the provision of school meals and the extension of that programme.  I urge that fruit would be included as part of the school meals programme.  Some of the schools in my area benefit from this programme and I believe the Department gets a good return from the moneys invested in it.  Those involved in the administration of the scheme are top class and ensure the programme achieves its objectives and targets.  This means the programme provides a good return for the moneys spent, which should be of some solace to the Minister.  However, oranges, apples and other fruit should be included in the meals programme to ensure improved health and nutrition for young children.  Issues such as food and nutrition are interlinked with other poverty issues.  The issue of poverty is homogenous and includes various issues that the Minister must make an effort to address.</P>
        <P>The ESRI is examining the amalgamation of the family income supplement, child dependant allowance and the various other allowances provided to help address poverty.  I can see where Deputy Stanton is coming from in this regard when he seeks an employment-neutral payment.  It is important that future supports be employment neutral.  Whatever status a person holds, we want the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to achieve the objective of the eradication of child poverty to apply.  The Minister has said one child in poverty is one too many, particularly in a time of affluence.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Sometimes when we change a system an unintended consequence of that action is that we create another poverty trap.  This was part of the problem with regard to the lone parent proposals.  I remember a paper being presented on the issue to the One Parent Exchange Network which demonstrated how we were almost sleepwalking into a minefield of various poverty traps.  People would have ended up worse off and being penalised for progress.  I compliment Deputy Stanton on how well he has covered that issue.  I understand what the Minister is saying but it is time we examined the idea of a second tier of child benefit supplement.  It is important that the universal principle of child benefit is preserved because it goes generally to the mother in the home who uses it to discharge various costs and expenses associated with the rearing of the child.  Child benefit is often the only source of a mother&rsquo;s <Col N="1208"/>independent finance.  Child benefit is sacrosanct and it must be protected.  As the Minister said, he is increasing it and in that regard he is doing well so far.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be glad to hear I am <i>ad idem</i> with him regarding child benefit supplement which must be geared to a certain income level to ensure it is targeted at the families experiencing poverty, particularly child poverty, which is the issue on which we are trying to focus.  The child benefit supplement must be employment neutral but a sum of &euro;25,000, &euro;30,000 or &euro;35,000 must be fixed.  People must realise this is a political objective.  Universal child benefit is appropriate but we are trying to come up with a solution to a problem that has been a source of great annoyance to many people and to the various organisations that have worked in this area.  It is important that we focus on that, although I realise the Minister will reply to the effect that he has implemented many measures in that area.</P>
        <P>On the child dependant allowance, my colleague, Deputy Paul McGrath, in one of his last contributions on social welfare, a subject on which he has much expertise &mdash; I bow to him in that regard because he has an intuitive grasp of the complexities of the social welfare area &mdash; was eager to ensure there would not be discrimination.  If ever a person achieved objectives it was Deputy McGrath, who wore out the Minister&rsquo;s officials on this issue.  The Minister dealt with him as spokesperson for only a few years but I worked with him for several years during which time he made a point on this issue.  When the election is called, Deputy Sean Ryan and Deputy Paul McGrath will leave this House having made no small achievements.  They are both parliamentarians who persisted and achieved something, and they should be proud of that.</P>
        <P>In this context, the child dependant allowance is important because it is targeted at people on social welfare, those on low incomes and so on.  As the Minister said, he eliminated the discrimination surrounding the particular type of social welfare payment being paid by the Department.</P>
        <P>The allowance was frozen because only those who were unemployed were paid it and if somebody moved into any sort of employment they immediately lost the allowance.  We went out of our minds here every year arguing with the Minister and his predecessors, including Proinsias De Rossa MEP &mdash; I will not politicise this &mdash; about this issue.  That was the rationale behind all the Ministers&rsquo; thoughts in this regard, and probably those of their departmental officials who considered this aspect.  This allowance was part of the child support system that was tied to unemployment payments and once the unemployed person or single parent moved to employment or went back to education, they lost substantially.</P>
        <P>The second tier payment would help those on social welfare and those who moved to employment, which is obviously the best route out of poverty.  If we could devise a workable scheme <Col N="1209"/>which would not create a new poverty trap it would cover those people who are in receipt of social welfare payments and those who take up work.  I am not talking about people earning &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 but those who might earn &euro;27,000, &euro;28,000, &euro;30,000 or &euro;35,000, or whatever the cut-off point would be.  They would continue to receive child dependant allowance.  That is the way to deal with poverty.  Deputy Stanton used the term &ldquo;employment neutral&rdquo;, which is an excellent phrase and one we will all borrow in the future.</P>
        <P>The non-means tested child benefit payment is universal and is paid to the primary carer, usually the mother.  It is often the only independent income the primary carer has and research shows it is almost always spent on children.  It is important that we continue to pay child benefit on a universal basis and target an additional tier or child benefit supplement at those on social welfare and those in jobs with a low income base but who nevertheless are getting their foot on the employment ladder.  They should not lose it immediately.  The income they derive from taking up employment is negatively impacted upon in so far as they would lose a benefit they had previously.  We must get to that stage and it is worth examining in terms of tackling child poverty.</P>
        <P>Child care costs is a major issue.  For many people it is the equivalent of a second mortgage.  Somebody told me the other day that child care can cost &euro;800 a month or more, which is more than the cost of a second mortgage.  People living in south Dublin, south-west Dublin and elsewhere are probably more acutely aware of the cost because it is probably higher.  If child care costs &euro;750 or &euro;800, that now has displaced the mortgage repayments as the biggest outlay one has on a monthly basis.  We need people in work to sustain the level of economic activity and to ensure we continue to get growth rates of 5%, 6% and more for the foreseeable future, but the negative aspect in that regard is that a significant amount of the income people generate is consumed by the payments they have to expend on child care and on the cost of travelling to work.  If the Government ensured we had a good public transport system which would get people to and from their place of work quickly, it would help both from a quality of life perspective and in ensuring people spend less on child care.</P>
        <P>Child care supplement is an important issue yet there was not much reference to it.  The Minister said it is a matter of choices but we cannot accept that.  I might make a different choice and the Minister would argue, probably correctly, that I made a wrong call on particular areas but he has made his choices.  Those are areas that will not go away.  Child poverty will not disappear overnight.  It must be a sustained and focused attack to eradicate child poverty once and for all.  Regardless of when we leave this D&aacute;il, alleviating and eradicating child poverty must be a primary focus of our political objectives.  If we fail to do that, <Col N="1210"/>we will stand indicted in the eyes of many people, particularly some of the organisations dealing with children, including Barnardos and others, which have asked the reason we have not achieved that goal. We have the resources and now is the time to ensure the problem is tackled in a fundamental way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Stanton for tabling this amendment and Deputy Penrose for his contribution.  We have dealt with this issue on different occasions when dealing with Estimates and the budget.  There is nobody in this House who would not put the elimination of child poverty as the number one priority in any approach to social issues.  The budget and this Bill make a significant contribution towards that, increasing the lower and higher child benefit rates by &euro;10 a month.  The new monthly rates are &euro;160 and &euro;195, which standardises all three qualified childhood allowances, formerly the child dependant allowances, to a single higher rate of &euro;22 per week.  In the case of family income supplement, the weekly income threshold is increased by amounts from &euro;15 to &euro;185, depending on family size.  Increases have been made in the rate of payment in the back to school clothing and footwear allowances by &euro;60 per child to &euro;180 for two to 11 year olds and by &euro;95 per child to &euro;285 for 12 to 22 year olds.  Additional funding of &euro;3 million is provided to extend the important schools meals programme.  There is a disregard on the guardian&rsquo;s payment, contributory and non-contributory, from assessment for supplementary welfare allowance and rent or mortgage interest supplement.  There is an increase in the spouse&rsquo;s income threshold for entitlement to a half rate qualified child allowance, otherwise known as CDAs, by &euro;50 from &euro;350 to &euro;400 per week for recipients of the following payments: job seeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit, injury benefit and health safety benefit.  They are the main changes which are targeted at tackling child poverty.</P>
        <P>In regard to child income support generally, it is important to note that child benefit as a percentage of total child benefit and CDA rates will be 62.7%.  Prior to these changes it was 67.3%.  Keeping the child benefit rate above the 60% or so level will avoid any disincentives.  I do not want to repeat myself but to put this in simple forms there has been a fundamental shift in this respect.  We cannot simply talk about child poverty and do nothing about it, and I suppose this change is at the expense of child benefit.  If this money was not put into child dependant allowance, it would almost certainly be put into child benefit.  Therefore, there has been a direct shift from the top two thirds of families who have children to the bottom one third of families who have children in the addition of the new CDAs, which will also come into effect from January but the child benefit changes do not come into effect until April.  There is an immediate benefit in respect of the former and the money will be targeted <Col N="1211"/>directly at where it is needed.  I strongly believe this is exactly the right approach to take now and the time is right to do it.  Many studies on child poverty have been undertaken, including those by Barnardos, Combat Poverty Agency and many other fine bodies and agencies.  We must target the resources at where they are needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will outline some examples, which I will circulate to Deputies, of families in receipt of welfare benefits and the value of their overall package of benefits, as we are inclined to deal with welfare items in a somewhat disjointed way.  When considering income tax scenarios, charts are normally presented which set out how individual families will fare.  However, charts setting out how families in receipt of welfare benefits will fare are seldom presented.  I have tried to advance this process by considering real life examples.  I will use the example of a lone parent with two children, a category in which child poverty is to be found as all the studies highlight, one of whom is aged under six and the lone parent earns &euro;20,000 per annum, the amount he or she is entitled to earn without losing his or her lone parent allowance completely.  Such a lone parent does not pay income tax, although there is some PRSI in this case, and the net earnings of that lone parent would be &euro;19,000.  The child dependant allowance in that case would be &euro;2,288, the one-parent family allowance would be &euro;3,812, the family income supplement would be &euro;1,872, the child benefit would be &euro;3,840, the fuel allowance, if applicable, which it would be in most cases, would be &euro;522 and the early child care supplement for the child aged under six would be &euro;1,000.  That means a lone parent with an income of &euro;20,000 with two children, one of whom is aged under six, has a net income of &euro;33,000, which involves a total social welfare package of &euro;13,564.  Therefore the total earnings of a lone parent with a small income of &euro;20,000 will increase by &euro;13,564.  Under last year&rsquo;s budget such a lone parent&rsquo;s income increased by &euro;4,000 and under this year&rsquo;s budget his or her income will increase by a further &euro;9,000.  There is an enormous and dramatic shift in terms of such a lone parent&rsquo;s increase in earnings this year over last year, when we did not include CDAs.  There is a 46% increase in income in that example.  That is not a skewed example; there are dozens of examples outlined here and they are all along the same lines, when account is taken of the increased CDAs and the FIS which is targeted at those on lower incomes.  With the increased CDAs, the increase in payment in respect of a child may be &euro;22 per month in addition to the payment of &euro;10 per month, which means the payment in respect of many children will be an increase of &euro;32.  I did not simply select a good example in the one I outlined &mdash; there are others along the same lines.  I will circulate these figures to Deputies.</P>
        <P>A couple who have four children, two aged under six and two aged over six, and who are <Col N="1212"/>working with earnings of &euro;30,000 per annum will receive &euro;44,000, which involves a total social welfare package of &euro;15,000.  Therefore, their income will increase from &euro;30,000 per annum to &euro;44,000 &mdash; or &euro;45,000 &mdash; which includes additional welfare benefit of &euro;14,000 or &euro;15,000 per annum.  That represents a 29% gain this year over last year.  The CDA element and the increase in FIS have a dramatic effect on low income earners and on people in receipt of welfare benefit, much more dramatic than last year.  The CDAs directly contributed to that.</P>
        <P>Deputy Stanton asked about child care provision.  All the lists I outlined of what we have been doing for children, while not specifically for child care provision, represent a substantial improvement in income for families who have children.  The Minister for Finance explained that he must find an extra &euro;100 million this year for payments under the early child care scheme because only three payments were made last year and four payments must be made next year.  That will cost an extra &euro;100 million.  Such an allocation will go into the system next year.  The Minister also explained that from the income viewpoint, he increased the threshold from &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 in terms of people minding children.  That is an improvement.  It was acknowledged that we needed to do that to bring more people into the system.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said in his speech that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, talked about 56,000 child care places.  So far, more than 32,000 new places have been created and a further 24,500 places have been supported with grant aid allocations amounting to &euro;500 million over the past six years.  He explained that to date more than 900 capital grant applications amounting to &euro;170 million on the national child care investment programme have been invested.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on this amendment.  I strongly argue that this is one of the strongest anti-child poverty packages ever introduced in this House because it makes a dramatic shift, as Members will note from the figures, from middle and higher income earners to those on welfare and lower incomes.  That is precisely the right direction to take if we are to eliminate child poverty.  I believe we can do this if we keep up the policies of targeting and showing preference.  The easiest thing to do is to increase child benefit every year.  It is politically popular and I would be much more popular in my constituency if I increased child benefit than to do what I did.  I moved that &euro;60 million down the line because of the argument made in this House that there is no point giving out about child poverty and then making universal payments to every child in the country.  I made that deliberate choice and I think it will make a real difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the thrust of what the Minister is doing.  He stated that he will circulate <Col N="1213"/>the document, which is very interesting.  He was very careful to mention the income of &euro;20,000 adding up to a final total of &euro;33,000, but he neglected to point out the outgoing expenditure.  If a lone parent works and must rely on child care for his or her children, then child care alone could cost &euro;9,600 per child per annum.  That takes a great lump out of a lone parent&rsquo;s income.  We have not even looked at the cost of child care for second and subsequent children.</P>
        <P>The Vincentian partnership recently produced a document that showed the real costs of living, with various baskets for people in different categories.  The EU-SILC report for 2005 stated that one in ten people experienced debt problems from ordinary living expenses.  This has been the most common type of deprivation reported since 2003 and it is particularly prevalent for households with children.  In 2005, almost 40% of lone parent households reported having debt problems, along with 15.3% of other parents in other households.  Among houses without children, proportions range from 4.5% for households with two adults to 6.3% for households with three or more adults.  The Minister has acknowledged the fact that families are going into debt from ordinary living expenses.  They are not going to Barbados, buying yachts or flash cars.  They must borrow to survive and the Minister has expressed alarm at the level of debt and the interest that is being paid back.  This proves that people out there are under pressure.</P>
        <P>I welcome what the Minister has done, as it is heading in the right direction.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 5 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6: </P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the numbers of eligible persons and proportion thereof availing of the Back-to-School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, among low income families.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will not dwell on this amendment because we have already debated the issue.  I want to table it because of the number of people availing of back to school clothing and footwear.  The Minister stated this morning that he would look at the idea of allowing people to avail of the allowance later in the year.  I suggest that people be allowed to avail of it until the end of November.  For various reasons, some people fall through the net, do not collect the allowance and only find out about it at the end of October when it is too late.  We want to reach out and help these people who should <Col N="1214"/>be getting this allowance but often find out about when it is too late.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister can tell me what is required.  Is it just some stroke of a pen or does it require a regulation or legislation?  How can we extend this for two months?  Would it cost anything extra, other than the payments people would receive, to which they are entitled anyway?  This is a practical problem that I have come across with my constituents time and again.  The Minister should at least extend the deadline to the end of November and we can see what happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the thrust of Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s amendment.  This is one of the few amendments that do not have an adverse financial impact.  If it can be construed by the Minister and his officials as having such an adverse impact, he is really saying that if the Department can save money by a strict imposition of a deadline, then that is a good day&rsquo;s work.  Things should not work like that, because the Minister and his officials are not getting paid on productivity.  If a pot of money is being provided for this, why not extend the date?  Deputy Stanton is absolutely right.  Many people are not aware of their rights.  That was the case with the FIS, which has been in existence for an age.  People are even more aware of it because they are in employment.</P>
        <P>We spoke about the carers.  If someone is in low income employment and is receiving the carer&rsquo;s allowance for a child within the house, that allowance is calculated as income for the purposes of evaluating that person&rsquo;s right to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  It seems that some regulation ensured that the carer&rsquo;s allowance would be included as part of the income calculation.  The Minister has some very competent legal people beside him to find that regulation.  He should root it out and boot it out.  Nonetheless, I acknowledge the increases the Minister has provided for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which are very worthwhile.  It is funny that as children get older, the costs of keeping them seem to get more expensive.  I feel that I had more money in 1990 than I have in 2006.  Sending children to school costs more and I want to acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>Anybody receiving the carer&rsquo;s allowance is not a millionaire and must have an income limit to qualify for it.  Why should that allowance be calculated as part of the income calculation?  It can be used to exclude people from eligibility for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s point is well made.  There is no cost to anybody.  The Minister should expand the deadline according to the Deputy&rsquo;s exhortation.  It might contribute to diminishing the level of poverty.  We all talk about the number of hot meals, changes of clothing, pairs of shoes and so on as the measurement of the fight against poverty.  This is very important for those who suffer significant cost impositions when their children <Col N="1215"/>go back to school.  Every change that will help in removing impediments to this scheme&rsquo;s availability for the people who deserve it, should be made.  That is why I am very supportive of Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s amendment.  I ask the Minister to examine the other one to which I have made reference as well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputies know, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance is being increased by 50%.  Another issue is whether we can extend the date and so on.  In previous years the national average number of applications made after the end of September was 1.5% of the total.  Based on information received to date, the number of applications received after the end of September 2006 is approximately 2,600, or 1.4% of all applications received.  The majority of these would have been processed under the scheme or the Health Service Executive would have used its discretion to make discretional needs payments, provided all the conditions for the scheme were met.  Nobody needs to be out of pocket but given the current arrangements they have to apply for and claim exceptional needs payments.</P>
        <P>The 1.4% relates to those who applied late, and perhaps a great many people did not apply at all because they knew they were late.  That percentage is more difficult to get because it is hard to calculate who does not apply.  I told the Deputies this morning that there was an argument for keeping this tight, but I undertook to examine it, and I will, to determine whether we can extend it to October or November.  The argument for keeping it tight I do not have to explain to the Deputies.  They both know the social welfare arguments in this regard.  The back-to-school allowance should focus on that time of the year.  We should not persuade people to expect to have these funds available at other times when children are not going back to school.  Although people are becoming increasingly sophisticated in handling finance, nonetheless if the payment is for a particular event, it should be paid at the appropriate time.  It would be nonsense to start paying it in June, April or May.  Having said that, I know that the end of September is very tight and I will examine as to whether it may be moved up a month or two.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should realise that it is a non-statutory scheme.  Therefore, this is something I might do by regulation, or without legislation.  I repeat my undertaking of this morning to look at whether a month or two might be added, while conscious of the argument that matters cannot be let drift too far.  There is a safety net and a fallback in that the HSE has discretion to make an exceptional needs payment if someone feels he or she has missed the boat completely.  To let it wander up to Christmas might not be wise, however; therefore, I will see about extending it by a month or two.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1216"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have suggested it should be to the end of November.  I understand it is available currently from June to September.  Many people would not start to avail of it until mid-August to the end of September.  I accept what the Minister said as regards people getting exceptional needs payments, but a great many probably do not apply because they know they are outside the date. </P>

	<P>Correct.  I welcome the fact the Minister is going to look at this, which is worthwhile.  As I said, many people are busy in September and may use funding to buy school uniforms etc. which could have been used for other things if they had the money.  A month or two would be very useful to see how matters would work.</P>
        <P>I am not sure whether the Minister has examined the possibility of paying this to all social welfare recipients and those on family income supplement as well, and linking FIS and the back-to-school allowance.  We have had this debate already, but I just want to mention it.  I shall withdraw the amendment based on Minister&rsquo;s assurance that he will examine the matter.  I look forward to an announcement on it some weekend.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of a cost of disability payment for people with disabilities.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is quite important and speaks for itself as regards the cost of disability payment.  We know people with disabilities have extra costs because of their conditions.  Whether a person is at work or at home and not at work, he or she requires extra heating.  He or she may not be able to go to the large supermarket where food is often cheaper and may have to go to the local shop.  There are extra costs involved in having a disability.  Very often where people make a supreme effort to find a job and become employed there are extra costs if they are disabled.</P>
        <P>Great efforts have been made in this area and there was a massive debate in the Mansion House just before the last election where the other disability Bill was thrown out.  Then we had the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, the Disability Act, structural plans and so on.  A great deal is going on and it is only right that this should be the case.  However, an enormous amount has yet to be done and we are only starting.  This is one concession that has been <Col N="1217"/>sought for quite a number of years and I just wonder what are the Minister&rsquo;s views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree this initiative has been ongoing.  Repeated attempts have been made by various organisations dealing with disability which have aired this issue in an holistic and very vocal manner over the years.  Obviously, significant additional costs are incurred by people with disabilities.  I will digress for a minute and mention that I was at the Westmeath Centre for Independent Living community centre in Kinnegad the other night.  One saw personal assistants there and the great work they are doing.  There is a combination of F&Aacute;S and the HSE and it is important the necessary funding for those personal assistants is streamlined and put in place to assist people with disabilities.  They provide them with a great sense of independence and vitality.  I saw the way those people were so excited the other night in getting various certificates.  These were headline achievements for them, allowing them to participate in a very full way in all societal events and tasks, in work, recreation and everything else.  We should acknowledge the role personal assistants and particularly centres of independence play right across the country, especially the one in Westmeath.  I salute it for the work it is doing under the chairmanship of Councillor Pat McLoughlin, with all the people involved, executive staff etc. in Kinnegad.  They have a lovely place and it is important that issues as regards funding, location, their concerns for having the building for the centre over a number of years etc. are addressed.  We should try to ensure resources are allocated to remove all doubts and uncertainties in this regard, which do not help in achieving the objective of maintaining a full, integrated role for disabled people within society.  It was wonderful to see their achievements in that regard.</P>
        <P>The cost of disability can be affected by many issues.  There are specific transport needs.  If one is in a house there are building adaptation costs, disability aids and appliances, heating requirements etc.  Some people need personal care assistants and very often additional home help hours have to be paid for.  They might be getting only one and a half or two hours a day, which is totally insufficient.  That is one other area that must be focused on as regards providing a comprehensive care package to enable such people to continue to live a full life in society.  All of this is only talk, however, unless we can address the specific area Deputy Stanton referred to, which is extremely important in the context of ensuring people can remain within the home environment.  If we can address this we will have significantly ensured that people can remain in the environment in which they are happiest, and continue to work and achieve great productivity &mdash; much more than some of us.  It is wonderful to see the achievements of those people.</P><Col N="1218"/>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s Department showed last year that about two thirds of people with disabilities fell below the 60% level of median income.  Something like a quarter of them suffered basic income deprivation.  That is an enormous number, so it is very clear in that context that this will have to be tackled in a focused and fundamental manner and that significant additional costs are associated with disability.  I have quoted the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland, which made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs about six weeks ago.  The society raised the necessity of the Government providing a cost of disability payment and indicated its research had shown that people with a disability were far less likely to be in paid work.</P>
        <P>A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often meant the end of such a person&rsquo;s paid employment.  In order to introduce some equality and equity into the system, Members must explore the issue of the introduction of a cost of disability payment.  The arguments are strong and sustained and have been made vehemently and with great force by the various organisations involved.  The cost of disability payment constitutes the central core of the various reports produced on disability and it must be addressed sooner or later.  People have become weary while waiting for something to happen in this regard.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Stanton suggested, I urge the preparation of a report on this issue.  I understand a sum of approximately &euro;40 was the initial amount suggested.  While that was some time ago and the amount is only pennies, the concept should be introduced.  The establishment of a floor level, even one of &euro;40, would be a start in securing recognition of the issue.  This would be important in the context of ensuring that the additional costs incurred by people with disabilities are met in some way and would constitute an important first step in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  People with disabilities are a specific low-income group that experiences disproportionate rates of unemployment and poverty.  Specific measures are necessary in order to assist many people with disabilities.  Deputy Penrose spoke of the cost of disability payment.  I understand the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the National Economic and Social Council have recommended the introduction of such a cost of disability payment in recognition of the fact that people incur additional costs.  Deputy Stanton outlined one such cost and the entire question of transport is the most obvious example.  However, there are also other factors, such as heating the home and so on.</P>
        <P>A report published in 2004 recommended the &euro;40 payment.  However, if the same report was commissioned today, it is likely the recommended amount would be higher.  The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities entitled, A Strategy for Equality, also recom<Col N="1219"/>mended this payment should be made to people with disability, irrespective of whether the person in question was at work.  The latter report was published ten years ago and no movement has been seen in this regard.  This was an area addressed by Sinn F&eacute;in in its pre-budget submission.  It is an issue on which the State has fallen down and the Minister should consider such funding.  While one may speak of rising tides lifting all boats and so on, it is clear that people with disabilities have been left behind.  Greater investment and support is required in this regard and this payment would constitute recognition of the additional difficulties and costs associated with maintaining an ordinary lifestyle for such individuals.  The Minister should examine this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for tabling amendment No. 7.  A working group chaired by the Department of Health and Children, which includes membership from my Department, has examined the feasibility of the introduction of a cost of disability payment.  The working group recommended that steps be taken to improve the quality of data relating to disability in Ireland.  For example, it suggested an adjustment of the existing data-gathering exercises undertaken by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, or other relevant bodies.  It wishes to include questions on the numbers per household with disabilities, the nature of the disability and the severity of impairment.  This will be addressed in the disability survey, which is being undertaken by the CSO following the 2006 census and the survey results will be available in 2007.</P>
        <P>The group has also examined the scope for addressing barriers that exist for people with disabilities who wish to undertake or increase their employment, thereby moving to a position of greater economic independence.  In this regard, as part of last year&rsquo;s social welfare budget, a change was introduced to the withdrawal rate of disability allowance for income in excess of the current earnings disregard.  This means that single people can earn up to a maximum of &euro;390 per week from rehabilitative employment before their disability allowances are fully withdrawn.  Other issues concerning the cost of disability will be considered following the development of a needs assessment system provided for under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which will commence for children aged up to five from mid-2007.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the Department&rsquo;s disability sectoral plan contains actions regarding the rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities to ensure that income supports and associated benefits do not create financial barriers preventing people with disabilities from participating in the labour force or availing of training, education or other developmental opportunities.  As Members will be aware, most Departments <Col N="1220"/>have a disability sectoral plan that clearly lays out the work ahead of them in this regard.</P>
        <P>A number of changes have been made in this regard in the budget.  I have extended entitlement to a full rate of disability allowance, which comes to &euro;185.80, to all people resident in institutions and Members have welcomed this measure.  While it is small in terms of cost, it is significant  in terms of recognition.  Moreover, 80% of it will probably come back through institutions anyway.  I have also extended entitlement to bereavement grants to the next of kin of deceased recipients of disability allowance aged 16 to 22.  Similarly, while this is a small cost, it is a significant recognition of the issue.  Personally, I felt strongly about the next measure and wanted to make a strong statement on it.  Consequently, I have increased the capital disregard for disability allowance by &euro;30,000, that is, from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, to allow people with disabilities to have that level of funds without it interfering with their disability allowance.  Additional funding of &euro;1.9 million has been allocated to Comhairle, the citizens information board, for the development of a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities and for the implementation of the disability sectoral plan.</P>
        <P>This is the position in respect of the cost of disability proposal.  I await the disability survey undertaken by the CSO, the results of which should be available in 2007.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of a national waste waiver system for all low-income households administered through the social welfare system.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This issue was discussed previously.  The idea of a national waste waiver for low-income households has been examined by the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Social and Family Affairs as a result of the Combat Poverty Agency&rsquo;s review of waste charges, which was carried out several years ago.  While waste collection is controlled and administered through local authorities, I wish to see the introduction of some social welfare voucher system for all low-income households that could be used at national level.  A national waste waiver for low-income households such as pensioners, people with disabilities, lone parents, low-income families in particular and those in receipt of social welfare payments has been supported by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Combat Poverty Agency and Age Action Ireland.</P><Col N="1221"/>
        <P>I am sure the Minister is aware the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs has held hearings on this issue.  It found a hotchpotch across the country as all local authorities have different ways of dealing with it.  While some local authorities have no waiver system, in others it is quite generous.  It changes depending on the budgetary pressures under which they operate.  Consequently, many low-income households, such as those on State pensions, lone parents and people in receipt of other social welfare payments are under pressure to pay waste charges.  While I do not state the two are related, I have noticed lately a significant increase in fly-tipping, both in my own locality and nationwide.  I do not state this is related to the fact that those on low incomes are finding it difficult to pay the charges.  Nevertheless, fly-tipping has increased.</P>
        <P>Some form of uniform system should be established throughout the State.  At present, simply living in one city or local authority area means that one gets support in this regard, while in another one does not.  The officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who appeared before the joint committee asserted that it is up to each local authority to do its own thing in this respect.  However, central Government has a role to co-ordinate or at least to lay down some markers in order that all citizens are treated equally.  I would be interested in the Minister&rsquo;s views on this area.  There are many more interesting amendments to come and I will not delay further on this one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has some of the best officials in the public service.  We have paid tribute to them previously and I pay tribute to them again.  We get a great service from them.  There is greater ingenuity in his Department in terms of seeing issues from a different perspective than in many others.  The Department officials would see the benefit of this move.</P>
        <P>Often the waiver schemes applicable to two persons living within a quarter of a mile of each other are different because they are administered by different local authorities.  Some local authorities provide a waiver system and some do not, while others provide a tag system where a person is entitled to a number of free bin tags.</P>
        <P>The Department is probably one of the best innovators in the administration of schemes.  I suppose the Department administers hundreds of schemes, far more than any other Department.  I realise the Minister would say that his officials are loaded down with consolidating Social Welfare Acts, to which we add every year, and with matters such as the Citizens Information Bill.  It takes the Department a long time to get to the bottom of all that work.  The Department&rsquo;s officials should be paid additional moneys for all the work they do in what is one of the more difficult areas because every day we find an issue, land it on their desk and ask them to use their discretion to deal with it as best they can.</P><Col N="1222"/>
        <P>Someone must tackle this issue eventually.  If I recall correctly the presentation made at the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government met officials from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated that it is up to each local authority to administer the system.  That is no use.  If pensioners are not gaining the benefit of a waiver, some of the few bob the Minister passes on to them is being subsumed back into the system while their neighbours across a local authority boundary a couple of hundred yards away, or on the far side of the road, may be eligible for a waiver.  What is important is the uniformity of the principle of a waiver system which takes cognisance of people&rsquo;s income, particularly those who are dependent on social welfare to meet their basic necessities of life.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his Department work extremely hard in that area, but it is not beyond the officials&rsquo; ingenuity to draw up a solution.  Obviously, it would involve a little joined up thinking between the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the representative managers&rsquo; association representing the local authorities.</P>
        <P>We, in County Westmeath, have a fairly good waiver system where those eligible get a number of free bin tags.  The tag achieves another objective because the more one recycles, the less refuse one must put out for collection.  If one is good at recycling, the tags might be almost sufficient to cover the year&rsquo;s collection.  There is an in-built incentive to act properly, taking cognisance of the environmental concern to reduce, reuse and recycle, and to achieve a national environmental objective.</P>
        <P>This is an important amendment and Deputy Stanton must be saluted for tabling it.  I support the idea in principle.  While I acknowledge it cannot happen overnight, perhaps it is a matter the Minister could examine.  The Minister is giving social welfare recipients what he hopes is enough for them to get by from week to week, but if they must address a cost such as this, it eats into their level of disposable income.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a number of meetings about this, both internally and between Departments.  I acknowledge that the situation is unsatisfactory.  Approximately half of the local authorities operate a waiver scheme and the others do not.</P>
        <P>I make this point not just because the three of us are here, but the position is that 14,000 households are in receipt of a waiver from South Dublin County Council and 2,000 households are in receipt of a waiver in Westmeath, which seems to run a good scheme.  Not to let Deputy Stanton off the hook&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Cork County Council grants a waiver to 6,000 households, of which approximately half are in receipt of State pensions and the other half are in receipt of other social welfare payments.  Impressively, Fingal County Council grants a waiver to 8,000 households, 2,000 of which are in receipt of State pensions and the rest of which include widows, job-seekers, one parent families, people on disability allowance and other social welfare payments.  If half the local authorities in the country can do it, there is no reason the other local authorities cannot do it.  Some of the local authorities doing it are not necessarily the better off ones, but they are stretching themselves and prioritising people on welfare which is what they should do.</P>
        <P>When we came to look at this, I was faced with the conclusion that any national scheme worth its salt which I might create would cost at least &euro;50 million.  If I was to go down that road, I would be paying most of that sum back to the local authorities because half of them would almost give up what they are currently doing.  If I had that kind of money, I would imagine half of it would go straight towards taking the pressure off the local authorities.  The Deputies might say it is all public money anyway but if half the local authorities in the country can do it, the other half should also do it.</P>
        <P>I do not understand why the local authorities do not make a waiver scheme a condition of contract.  It is not enough for some local authorities to shrug their shoulders and say that they have privatised waste collection and it is none of their business any more.  Everyone knows that when giving out a contract one is in a powerful position and the people who bid for the contract who give the best deal on waivers should get brownie points in the assessment of the tenders.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, knows my views on this area and I will do what I can to ensure the rest of the local authorities deliver.  It is not fair that many people on welfare in one part of the country are entitled to waivers and others are not.  I find that trying to fill the gap is complicated, but I make these comments today deliberately and will continue to see how I can be helpful in this area.  What is going on is just not satisfactory.</P>

Perhaps my faith in the system is being restored.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report on extending the free travel scheme to include other service providers, with a view to improving free travel benefits for people in rural areas.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is similar to the issue addressed in amendment No. 8.  I have raised the issue of public transport and the free travel scheme in rural areas with this Minister and others for some time.  Despite holding free travel passes, many older persons and persons with disabilities are unable to benefit from the range of services available to free travel pass holders in cities and larger towns.  I ask the Minister to look at introducing a voucher scheme which could be used in hackneys and other private transport in addition to the free travel pass for persons in rural areas.  This would be of particular benefit to persons living in areas which are not serviced by public buses, or even by the rural transport initiative.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that there could be costs involved, but I would imagine that they would not be high given the numbers of free travel pass holders in these areas.  If a person has a free travel pass and cannot access free travel because there is no public transport available, this voucher system would be important.  Perhaps the Minister will give us his views on it.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>This case has been put forward many times and I accept that there is an issue.  There are huge cost implications in trying to roll this out further than it currently extends.  The Deputy will be aware that I recently abolished the restriction on peak times and that will be of considerable assistance to those who use free travel.  The budget also contained provision for entitlement to a companion pass for those aged 66 to 74 years who are certified as medically unfit to travel alone.  These two important changes have been made.</P><Col N="1225"/>
        <P>My Department is always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.  I invite them to make such applications.  Deputies will also be aware of the rural transport initiative, managed by Pobal and formerly managed by ADM, on behalf of the Minister for Transport.  We are continuing to develop this scheme.</P>
        <P>There certainly is an issue in this area.  I had representations from County Donegal some time ago about the difficulty in accessing transport to Dublin from parts of the county.  Some suggested that we should consider paying airfares from Donegal to Dublin.  One can see how it quickly spreads.</P>
        <P>As I said, the case has been made many times.  We have not as yet ventured into the area of providing free taxi or hackney travel.  We have concentrated on improving the bus service and the rural transport initiative.  We have invited more private sector operators to apply to us for inclusion in the free travel scheme.  While I acknowledge that difficulties exist in some rural areas, I do not propose to extend this into the taxi area.  However, we will keep it under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>If someone is living in an isolated rural area, he or she should have the facility to get to the nearest public transport bus stop, train station or town.  Some people may only want to go to town once a week for shopping, but they cannot do so if there is no public transport or no neighbours willing to help.  A voucher scheme, limited to a certain amount per week, could be put in place for this purpose.  It would be hugely advantageous to people who are isolated in rural areas.</P>
        <P>I have often raised the issue of rural poverty.  It is a hidden poverty in modern Ireland.  Perhaps I should not mention it, but we now also have the issue of drink driving.  The only social outlet for many people was the local pub and people are now wary of going there and having one or two drinks.  We are not in any way advocating that people should drink and drive.  However, a limited voucher system may work in these circumstances.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister has taken this issue on board.  I withdraw the amendment on the basis of his response.</P>

        <P>Amendment No. 11 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the <Col N="1226"/>introduction of a scheme to provide for 3 to 5 days of paternity leave and benefit, including details of&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) qualification criteria, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) payment methods,</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">for the scheme, which shall be run on a similar basis to entitlement to maternity leave and benefit.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Other countries have substantial allowances for paternity leave.  Increases in maternity benefit are welcome, as is the extension of four weeks to both the paid and unpaid maternity leave entitlements.  Fine Gael has advocated this for some time.  However, the Government did not move to introduce paid paternity leave, or any paid parental leave entitlements which are commonplace in many EU countries.  Despite increases in length and flexibility in parental leave entitlements, there are no paternity leave entitlements for fathers at all and many families who are entitled to unpaid parental leave cannot afford to avail of it.</P>
        <P>Some provision for paid paternity leave could be introduced through the PRSI system and would go some way to recognising the importance of a father&rsquo;s role in his child&rsquo;s life.  Fine Gael suggests that it could commence by giving fathers three days paid paternity leave and one week of paid parental leave.  Fathers have a particularly important role to play at the time of the birth or adoption of a child.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on this suggestion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the concept behind Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s amendment.  It is important within the context of equality within the social welfare system.  It is important that there is equality, equity and access to the availability of all schemes.  In that context, paternity leave for fathers has a role in that it would give fathers the opportunity to be present at a crucial time in the life of the child.  Other European countries have adopted such procedures.</P>
        <P>Income levels sometimes do not permit fathers to take paternity leave.  While someone in a well paid job may be in a position to take time, low to middle income earners are not in a position to do so.  I welcome the increases in maternity leave which saw the Government fulfilling the promise it made in 2005 to provide an additional eight weeks leave.  It is hard to resist the argument that paternity leave of three days initially, and a full working week at a later point, be granted.  Some people may not take the three days together.  Nevertheless, the overall welfare system would at least recognise the crucial role of fathers in the family unit.</P>
        <P>This scheme could be administered and run along the same lines as the entitlement to maternity leave and benefits.  The same qualifying criteria could be put in place to ensure equity of <Col N="1227"/>access and acknowledgement of contributions to the PRSI system for paternity leave and benefits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputies know, while males are not entitled under Irish law to either paid or unpaid paternity leave, they may be entitled to parental leave.  Parental leave entitles both qualifying parents to take a period of up to 14 weeks unpaid leave from employment in respect of children aged up to eight years of age.  Paternity leave is generally understood to be the period immediately after the birth of a child and such leave is not a feature of our system.</P>
        <P>The question of social insurance funded payment for paternity leave would be contingent on the underlying entitlement to statutory parental leave.  In the absence of statutory provision for entitlement to paternity leave, the question of making a social insurance-based payment during such an absence does not arise.</P>
        <P>It is worth pointing out that responsibility for questions relating to entitlement to paternity leave rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Entitlement to paid paternity leave was considered by the working group on social partnership which undertook a review of the Parental Leave Act 1998.  The report was published in 2001 and dealt with the principle of paid paternity leave.  It stated that the group had divergent points of view and could not reach a consensus on the issue.  For that reason, no specific proposals for paid paternity leave were advanced.</P>
        <P>Should a framework for paid paternity leave be introduced, the cost of such a scheme for three days at 80% of wages, subject to a minimum rate of &euro;270.80 and a maximum of &euro;280 per week, is estimated at almost &euro;6 million.  This could rise to &euro;10 million for five days paid paternity leave.  Both of those are based on the assumption that all fathers would take the leave and 95% of them would be paid at the higher rate.  There are no specific proposals at this point to introduce paternity leave but I have outlined the costs and draw Members&rsquo; attention to the availability of parental leave.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>

        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the social welfare <Col N="1228"/>support payments and availability of other departmental schemes for widows, with particular emphasis on young widows.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an important issue.  The National Association of Widows in Ireland estimates there are a total of 150,000 widows in Ireland, although the Minister may have more up-to-date figures.  Many widows are unhappy at the lack of recognition of their situation in the budget this year.  Many younger widows, who are dependent on non-contributory and contributory widow&rsquo;s pensions, are not entitled to any of the free schemes of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Also, widows who choose to work and receive a contributory widow&rsquo;s pension continue to have to pay PRSI.  When they reach pension age they will only be eligible for one pension, whereas a person who chooses not to work will never have to contribute to the PRSI system and will still receive the same pension on retirement.</P>
        <P>Widows, particularly those in their late 50s or early 60s and only a few years away from retirement, who might find it difficult to get a job, are at a particular disadvantage.  I urge the Minister to consider what can be done to help this group as many suffer from poverty and deprivation.  Not only do they lose a partner who has helped them for a long time, they also find their income drastically reduced.  This is an area which has not received much attention in recent years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>The position of widows has been a long-standing bone of contention for me.  When they lose their spouse, especially if they have two or three young children, it is a time of huge vulnerability.  Having lost their main breadwinner and find their income slashed by maybe 60% or 70%, they need compassion and positive help.  The social welfare system has been remiss in abjectly failing to recognise the plight of widows.  </P>
        <P>The Minister will correctly say the widowed parent&rsquo;s grant has gone up from &euro;1,300 to &euro;4,000 for 2007, which is over 300%, and it would be churlish not to acknowledge it.  The household benefits package should focus above all on this area, even if it is for a limited period of, for example, three to four years, to help bereaved people until they can regain independence.  They may have depended on a spouse to carry out various chores or as the main breadwinner.  In that period of readjustment to a new situation they should be assisted.  The general public would be supportive of any measures to assist widows in a period of great trauma, distress and loneliness as a result of losing their loved one.</P>
        <P>The household benefits package could be usefully explored in the context of trying to provide maximum help.  Bereavement is a time of great vulnerability and I have constantly agitated in this regard for the past nine or ten years and more.  I have a particular interest and call on the Minister to commission a report to consider the costs associated with improving the household benefits <Col N="1229"/>package available to widows, even for a limited period while they readjust.  It would be appropriate to do so at this moment, when we have significant resources and can afford to help people.  The welfare system should be about helping people when they are most vulnerable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Widows and widowers can qualify for a number of different schemes, depending on their circumstances.  The contributory widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pension is available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either by virtue of their own record or that of their deceased spouse, and those qualifying are not subject to a means test.  Those without the necessary PRSI contributions, which now comprise the larger group can, if they have qualifying children, receive the one-parent family payment.  This is a means-tested payment which comprises an earnings disregard and is designed to assist with the extra costs those with children face in trying to access training or employment.  As the House knows, up to &euro;146.50 per week is completely disregarded while earnings in excess of that and up to &euro;400 are assessed at 50%, an increase in the budget from &euro;375.</P>
        <P>The widowed parent&rsquo;s grant, as Deputy Penrose mentioned, has been increased from &euro;2,700 to &euro;4,000 and the increases in child benefit and qualifying child dependant allowance will assist widows and widowers who have children.  As the House knows, we have made substantial increases to child benefit and the CDAs.</P>
        <P>People with children under six years will also qualify for the early child care supplement.  Widowed persons without dependent children, if under 66 years, may qualify for a non-contributory pension or, if they are over 66, the State non-contributory pension.  When I introduced the latter in September the basic means disregard was increased by &euro;7.60 to &euro;20 per week while a specific, additional disregard of &euro;100 per week has been included where the pensioner was in employment.  As the House knows, I have increased that to &euro;200 in this budget.  It is intended as an incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to return to work.</P>
        <P>I agree with the House that we must keep constantly under review the adequacy of payments for widowed persons and welfare recipients in general.  In this budget widowed people received increases of between &euro;16 and &euro;20 per week, depending on which category they fell into, which is considerably above the inflation rate.  There are a large number of schemes and welfare conduits to support widows and widowers, particularly those with children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his remarks and the fact that he undertook to keep the matter under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave the Minister too much credit.  The widowed parent&rsquo;s grant increased by <Col N="1230"/>&euro;1,300, not by the amount I said, but it is still significant, with an increase of over 50%.  Is that paid to every widow?  What are the qualifying criteria?  Is it a universal payment, providing a widowed parent has a child? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is it is universal, subject to having a child.  The increase is paid from budget day.  The grant was previously &euro;2,700 and was increased by &euro;1,300.  Perhaps I did not say it correctly.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the level of work force participation and improvement of in-work employment supports for people of pensionable age.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns pensioners continuing to work.  It suggests the Minister prepare a report on the level of work force participation and improvement of in-work employment supports for people of pensionable age.  The means disregard for non-contributory pensioners was increased from &euro;20 to &euro;30 per week and the income disregard for earnings from insurable employment was increased from &euro;100 to &euro;200, which will come into effect in September 2007.  Perhaps the raising of the income threshold will do more to encourage take-up of this disregard, as it has been applied to the pensions of only 398 of the 97,411 non-contributory pensioners, some 0.4%.  Will the Minister comment in this regard?</P>
        <P>The Minister has stated many times that he wishes to encourage more people of pension age who wish to work to do so.  The income disregard alone has not done anything to improve the situation.  Perhaps underlying reasons need to be investigated.  I have heard many people of pension age complaining of ageism by employers, which accounts for 12.5% of the cases of the Equality Authority of Ireland and the Government should take more action to combat this form of discrimination.  Employment and in-work supports and education and training options for older people need to be addressed to improve the employment prospects of older people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment relates to an important issue.  In reply to the Minister&rsquo;s statement on Second Stage, I pointed out that if we want to widen the opportunity for people to contribute to their pensions, it has been accepted that we should include shopkeepers&rsquo; and farmers&rsquo; spouses.</P><Col N="1231"/>
        <P>Regarding people who were previously restricted in this respect, such as those in receipt of farm assistance or jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance payments, the Minister has required them to make contributions under the S1 system.  This is as important a change as the Minister has ever made.  While it affects a small number of people, it sends a signal and provides people with the opportunity to secure their long-term futures from a pension perspective.</P>
        <P>The number of shopkeepers has fallen significantly and many old corner shops in rural and urban Ireland are losing to apparent progress, namely, big multiples and so on.  Those people served and continue to serve an important function, particularly in rural areas where newsagents, tobacconists and fuel providers were available from 7 a.m. until late at night.</P>
        <P>Likewise, farmers&rsquo; spouses have made important contributions to the maintenance and improvement of their farms.  The Minister will say that their involvement in the running of their farms must be proven via joint bank accounts, which is a complex process.  Rather than putting people through that onerous task, it should be assumed that farmers&rsquo; spouses make significant contributions to the viability of their farms.  Their roles should not be underestimated.  This matter must be examined sooner rather than later if we are to introduce equality into the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Stanton for tabling this amendment.  In many ways, it is self-explanatory that policy has been aimed at increasing workforce participation among all groups in society, including older workers, in recent years.  This policy extends to the lone parent system reforms in that we will press ahead with the disregards that will allow lone parents to participate in the workforce.  Increasingly, people with disabilities apply for exemptions and many are taking up training and education.  We can discuss this matter further to try to ensure that people with disabilities can play a stronger role in the workforce if they wish to do so.</P>
        <P>It is clear that we should facilitate pensioners or older people who wish to continue working and we are designing a pension system that will encourage them to do so.  Last year, I decided for the first time to permit someone on a non-contributory pension to earn money without its interfering with his or her pension.  This year, the amount will be &euro;200.</P>
        <P>When one starts a scheme, people look at their side view mirrors.  While they can see out the windscreen, they ask how that view can be widened.  People on contributory pensions have the option to make a few bob from their hobbies or to earn money by taking up employment, but people on non-contributory pensions did not have this option because it would have reduced their pensions.  We are starting to focus on employment in this respect.  I do not doubt that <Col N="1232"/>once the administrative procedures and structures and financial issues have been resolved in years to come, the provision will include the self-employed, but it is a good start and a step in the right direction.</P>
        <P>Someone on a non-contributory pension can earn &euro;10,000 per year from employment without interfering with a cent of his or her pension.  This sends a strong signal to the effect that, after years of building the country, a pension is a person&rsquo;s right.  I believe strongly in this issue and have tried to advance it as best I could.  A pension is a pension and we should not reduce or interfere with it by any means.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will not press the amendment, but I have no difficulty with its sentiments.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the option of payment of the fuel allowance as a once-off bulk payment.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Senator Browne feels strongly on this issue, which we discussed previously.  I would like the Minister to examine the possibility of a bulk payment of the fuel allowance and extension of the time limit to perhaps 34 weeks in respect of people with severe illness.</P>
        <P>The bulk payment has been proposed because it would allow people to purchase oil for heating, which can only be bought in large quantities and poses a cost that is difficult for low income households to meet.  Payment in bulk should not mean any additional cost for the Department and should be easier to administer.  I know that the Minister and the authorities in Northern Ireland are examining the matter.  While it is not a significant issue, it could make a difference to some households.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P><Col N="1233"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on improving entitlement levels to full contributory pensions for all older people.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While this is an important amendment, there is not much time left to debate the Bill.  The amendment relates to a better entitlement to a full contributory pension for qualified adults, many of whom have been excluded from eligibility for a contributory pension as a result of the marriage bar and the failure of all Governments to introduce retrospective credits for homemakers and, in doing so, to give many women recognition for the years they spent working in the home.  Consequently, many elderly women are on low incomes and are dependent on their husbands for entitlements to social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>There are issues regarding the PRSI system, as outlined by the IFA, that make it difficult for farmers&rsquo; spouses to qualify for old age or State pensions unless they become partners in the farm businesses or are paid a wage by their spouses.  Many elderly pensioners on half rate pre-1953 pensioners and <i>pro rata</i> pensions are excluded from receiving full contributory pensions as a result of changes in the PRSI system and the fact that they needed to move abroad to get work.  This relates to the famous averaging rule.</P>
        <P>There is also the matter of social insurance changes for the self-employed in 1988 and the ten year rule, which meant that any self-employed person, in particular farmers who were between 60 years and 65 years of age in 1988, did not fulfil the eligibility criteria for a full contributory pension.  The IFA has suggested that a special half rate pension be introduced for these people and a 75% pension for those aged between 56 years and 60 years of age when the change came into force.</P>
        <P>The Minister has expressed an interest in making alterations to the social insurance system to allow people over 65 years to continue to pay PRSI and improve their contributory pension entitlements.  He could also examine the possibility of allowing people to defer State pension entitlements in favour of a higher rate payment for later retirement.  While we will not reach the matter of social insurance for childminders, it should be examined.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;, with any necessary modifications,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">On Committee Stage, I argued that we must ensure the Data Protection Acts we have passed in this House will have full effect over this Bill.  Currently, the Bill contains the wording &ldquo;with any necessary modifications&rdquo; but it does not detail who decides the modifications or what might be necessary.  This is the only time we will have a say in the Bill on the future conduct of Europol.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is regrettable amendment No. 1 was ruled out of order, despite my arguing it on Committee Stage and raising the issue involved on Second Stage.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled that it is in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  I do not believe that because it simply stated that the Bill should not come into effect until such time as the safeguards as outlined are in place.  We do not oppose the Bill.  I stated on Second Stage that I was not opposed to it as a whole.  We support proper and effective cross-border communications and co-operation between police forces where such action strikes the correct balance between the need and the right of individuals and communities to be safe from organised crime with the civil and human rights of an individual.  It is bizarre that amendment No. 1 was ruled out of order.  It did not go against the Bill, it allowed this <Col N="1235"/>House further opportunities to ensure that before the Bill comes into effect, the required safeguards to ensure Europol members would be held to account are in place.  I have not seen where or whether the members of Europol will come under the Garda ombudsman commission despite the ability that Europol investigation teams can operate within this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The key data protection principle is that there is an onus on data controllers to ensure the data are updated and accurate.  We must ensure that when we pass such legislation we are satisfied that the standards and protections we would require are also implemented in Europe.  I do not want to leave it to some anonymous person to decide the necessary modifications to the Data Protection Act without this House being informed.</P>
        <P>Already there are problems with data protection standards in various police forces.  The garda&iacute; failed last year to update their files on Frank McBrearty Jnr., who was denied entry to the United States as a result of that failure.  Standards are not being upheld.  In England it was disclosed that British files wrongly listed thousands of people as criminals, resulting in many of them being refused employment.  We must be careful if data are being recorded that they are recorded accurately and that proper regulations are in place for data controllers.  That is why we passed Data Protection Acts, although we have not been proactive enough in doing so.  Usually the revelation of data passing between State agencies occurred to prompt data protection measures, a point I have argued on other occasions where we have dealt with European legislation.</P>
        <P>Given the Government&rsquo;s failure to ensure the data protection rights of individuals are fully protected by our police force, how can we guarantee the rights they should have will be protected by Europol if someone unknown can make the necessary modifications?  The Bill will allow Europol members to participate in joint investigation teams and there is a push at European level to give Europol more powers, including the ability to attend the scene of crime to search and confiscate.  What will the channels of redress be should members of Europol breach the rights of an Irish citizen?  Will the Garda ombudsman have the power to hold members of Europol to account to the same degree it will be able to hold members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account at some stage next year when it is operational, although not on 1 January as we had hoped?</P>
        <P>There are questions to answer and the two amendments I tabled, one of which the Ceann Comhairle misguidedly ruled out of order, would serve to ensure our laws are to the fore when dealing with this and that we have the necessary protections.  Other than that there are questions about the Bill as a whole, which I raised on Second and Committee Stages, but the main problem we have is to ensure our existing protocols are maintained and that if we pass future <Col N="1236"/>data protection Acts and regulations, they will have an effect.  I am worried about this.  If data protection standards are improved in the future, will that require amendment by all 25 EU member states of their data protection legislation to bring in new or minimum standards?  It has been argued in the House that there is a requirement to increase data protection to ensure when material is shared by various agencies, such as police forces in this case, it is not abused.  If the information is found to be incorrect, it must also be ensured that the Garda has a channel through which it can immediately pass information to another police force, such as Police Nationale in France.</P>
        <P>It should be obligatory on the Garda or Europol to forward the new and updated information immediately.  If Europol officers find that the information they receive is false, misleading or slightly inaccurate, a mechanism should be in place to flag this to make sure the data is corrected and updated for the officers who accessed it.  This would prevent officers using incorrect information and courts being misled because the information is inaccurate and concerns somebody else.  I hope the Minister of State will take this issue on board so that, at least, he will provide clarification about who will be responsible for the &ldquo;necessary modifications&rdquo;.  This phrase could have many meanings and a more specific reference should be included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael is continually supportive of measures that help our police force and other European police forces to take on the enormous task they face dealing with major drug barons and people trafficking, which has emerged as a serious issue in recent times.  Given the expansion of the Union, co-operation between police forces is particularly important.  Our only reservation concerns whether the Garda would have the resources, manpower, linguistic skills and information technology to maximise its interaction with other police forces.  We should always guard against the infringement of civil rights and perhaps the Minister of State will explain the phrase &ldquo;necessary modifications&rdquo;, which is vague.  However, we broadly support the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fortuitous that the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights is in the Chair for such an important debate.  This is the only justice measure to come before the House on which I have not tabled amendments because it involves the enactment of protocols and international covenants under which Ireland has agreed to share information and ensure effective policing throughout Europe.</P>
        <P>As all our business becomes more globalised, it must be ensured that the defences we put in place to protect ourselves from international crime are also robust.  I welcome these measures and I am guided by the work of the Joint Com<Col N="1237"/>mittee on Child Protection over the past number of months.  Major concerns raised at its meetings are the trafficking of people to Ireland and other member states and the movement of convicted paedophiles, particularly when their whereabouts are not known by authorities.  These issues need more regulation and publicity.</P>
        <P>In the past few days Ireland has been given a good reason to consider very carefully the international movement of drugs.  The horrific double murder of two individuals yesterday, one of whom was plying his trade and was totally innocent, underscores the importance of ensuring a robust policing support system in the State.  Drug lords based in Spain and the Netherlands are trafficking drugs into Ireland and it has become a billion euro business.  The interdictions of drugs in the first ten months of this year highlight a tenfold increase in the volume of drugs seized by the Garda compared to the same period last year.  While I congratulate the Garda on this magnificent success, unfortunately, it has not impacted on the availability or price of heroin on the streets.  We have an enormous job to do and a robust response is needed to the expanding international drugs cartels, which are peddling death on our streets.</P>
        <P>I support the legislation, which will be an additional weapon in the armoury of the Garda, as it will allow the force to share information.  I hope the European Union will put in place as robust and unified a policing system as possible to monitor international crime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Following consultation by my Department with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the matter, he has advised that the words &ldquo;with any necessary modifications&rdquo;, which the amendment proposes to delete, are necessary to ensure our Data Protection Acts apply and have full effect.  These words were included in the Europol Act 1997 and they are a common form in Acts such as this, which give effect to international instruments, for example, section 5 of the Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Act 2001.  The Deputy will agree the issues he seeks to address in the amendment are adequately covered by legislation and, therefore, I do not propose to accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation still does not outline who will make the &ldquo;necessary modifications&rdquo;.  I support the principle underpinning the legislation but it is a pity the Minister of State has not provided a satisfactory reply to my question.  Is it envisaged that the protocols covered by the Bill will be subject to 25 different Data Protection Acts in the European Union?  Will the Parliamentary Counsel make the &ldquo;necessary modifications&rdquo;?  Have those modifications been identified?  Is this only a case of dotting the i&rsquo;s and <Col N="1238"/>crossing the t&rsquo;s?  If that were the case, I could understand it.</P>
        <P>Other people in the European Union have a different vision from us and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the criminal justice system and the sovereignty of this Parliament over criminal justice issues.  The Minister has argued for the retention of unanimity rather than a qualified majority vote.  We must be careful in dealing with justice issues to ensure we do not give <i>carte blanche.</i></P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Europol Act 1997 the same terminology, &ldquo;with any necessary modifications&rdquo;, was included and the Office of the Attorney General is of the view that these words should be retained.  It is a common word construction that is necessary to give effect to the relevant section of the Bill and one used in other legislation.  I do not think the Deputy need worry about this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish the point I was making.  The chairman&rsquo;s summary of the high level conference on the future of Europol of February 2006 stated that &ldquo;ways should be found to enable Europol to exchange information also with countries that do not have the same data protection standards as those applicable within the European Union&rdquo;.  This legislation will not allow for this because it is specific to what is in place, which suggests the Government is already looking for ways around data protection issues.</P>
        <P>This legislation is vital.  Deputy Howlin is correct that we must do everything we can to stop drug barons in this state getting weapons and drugs onto the streets and having a devastating effect.  In this globalised world there is a need for data exchange to ensure the Garda will be increasingly successful in the capture of such shipments.  Luckily for many, it has been successful in this regard in recent days, weeks and months.  This is only the beginning of the fight against drug barons because it is internationally accepted that police forces capture only 10% of drugs trafficked.</P>
        <P>We must have the highest possible standards of data protection.  I have requested, on a number of EU justice measures in this House, that we prioritise data protection and put in place data sharing mechanisms.  There should be a standard of data protection across the European Union that is even higher than that in Ireland because this would negate the possibility of mistakes such as those I listed on an international scale.  In such circumstances the public could be confident that mistakes would not be made and that the data shared would have built in protection.  Measures would be necessary to ensure that if mistakes were spotted in shared data, they could be corrected throughout the European Union.</P>
        <P>I will not labour my point, as there does not appear to be much support for my proposal.  The first amendment I tabled was of key significance and it is regrettable that the Acting Chairman <Col N="1239"/>ruled it out of order, despite the fact that it was not contrary to the purpose of the Bill, that I mentioned it on Second Stage and that I had argued the point on Committee Stage.  It would have given greater effect to the points I was making than the amendment which seeks to provide for &ldquo;necessary modifications&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and the interest they have shown in the issues covered by the Bill.  While it is short, it is very important in increasing the level of co-operation between member states in the fight against international organised crime, as recognised by Opposition Deputies.  It is important that it be enacted without further delay and that the three protocols that are the subject of the Bill become Schedules to the Europol Act 1997 to facilitate ratification by Ireland.  </P>
        <P>Crime does not respect national borders.  International networks are increasingly being used by criminals to carry out activities.  The Government and its EU partners are aware that international organised crime cannot be tackled effectively by relying solely on national law enforcement agencies.  That is why our participation in Europol is vital.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, but I am satisfied, as the Attorney General strongly advises, that it is adequately covered in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I thank Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas for the support they have given to the Bill.  I also thank the staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the work they have done in bringing the Bill to completion, as it will strengthen our hand in tackling crime at international level.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for dealing with the Bill that passed easily through the House with the Opposition&rsquo;s support.  It is an important Bill and important issues must be addressed in international law enforcement.  I hope the Bill will help in that regard.</P>

	<P>I will be sharing time with Deputies Glennon and Fiona O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>One can understand why this Private Members&rsquo; motion has been tabled but we should examine the causes of some of these problems when considering the entire issue.  We must accept that the economic progress experienced by the country, especially Dublin, has resulted in a very high number of vehicle registrations.  Approximately 120,000 vehicles are now being registered annually.  While these vehicles represent a significant contribution to our traffic problems, they are the result of the progress made in our economy and the fact that Irish people have become accustomed to using cars and are not prepared to give up their transport independence, so it will be difficult to persuade them to use public transport.</P>
        <P>There has been widespread discussion about the volume of traffic on the M50.  When the M50 first opened, it carried 9,000 vehicles per day but it now carries closer to 90,000.  It is no wonder, therefore, that problems arise.  These problems are being addressed through the ongoing upgrade of the motorway but delays and inconvenience will be inevitable while these roadworks are in progress.</P>
        <P>Many would agree that the toll booths on the M50 are not the most effective means of collecting tolls.  If we are going to collect tolls, we <Col N="1242"/>should consider replacing the present system with barrier free tolling or other mechanisms.  The present system allows 600 to 700 vehicles per hour to pass through each lane, whereas a barrier free system would allow up to 1,700.  The Government&rsquo;s proposal to buy out the tolls is commendable and even though reform is not coming quickly enough for everybody, the Government cannot be seen to be prepared to throw endless money at National Toll Roads, which will naturally seek the highest price it can.</P>
        <P>Next week will see the opening of the port tunnel, a major engineering feat which will divert a large number of heavy vehicles away from the city centre.  I hope, however, that people will be tolerant of any teething problems the tunnel may experience when it first opens.  If the current volume of heavy vehicles travelling along the quays was diverted elsewhere, significant improvements would result in terms of the free movement of traffic.</P>
        <P>A number of additional quality bus corridors have been designated, which is welcome.  However, it is not particularly easy to persuade people to make greater use of public transport.  The Luas has proven a success, with the numbers of passengers using it increasing on a weekly basis, and I expect the metro will be similarly successful.  However, we must accept that despite the improvements being made, many of the existing problems are not due to lack of investment but result from the volume of vehicles on our roads.  In that regard, car traffic will move more freely once heavy goods vehicles leave the city centre.</P>
        <P>Significant investments have been made in other forms of public transport, including rail, and on the road network.  The purchase of new trains and carriages have allowed for a 25% increase in capacity on the Maynooth line, 40% on the Dundalk line and 30% on the Gorey line.  Ongoing upgrades on the track between Maynooth and Clonsilla and the 143 new diesel commuter rail cars now in operation will provide for a better service.  I will be parochial and say I look forward to seeing new carriages on the Dublin-Sligo line by early next year and the resulting intercity standard of service.</P>
        <P>I hope the various groups involved in developing the Dublin transport authority will commit to improving transport in the city.  They need to be positive because if they decide to take a negative approach, they will cause enormous problems.</P>
        <P>It is welcome that the new docklands station will open in April, four months ahead of schedule.  However, if we are to take people out of their cars and put them on public transport, we will have to ensure our public transport system works.  The Luas is a good and punctual transport system, which proves that, despite the early critics, it was a sound investment in terms of reducing traffic volumes.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that local authorities in the greater Dublin area did not take up the offer of <Col N="1243"/>money to develop park and ride facilities.  I appeal to the local authorities concerned to provide sites for park and ride facilities because people will use them.  None of us would welcome the fact that public money was left unspent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>

	<P>We could argue whether the facilities exist but I understand that offers on facilities have not been taken up.  If sites are not provided, I do not see how a question could arise with regard to buses.  In respect of a number of recent developments around Dublin, planners have erred in deciding not to order the construction of transport infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Major investments have been made on the national road network, which is vital to the overall development of the country.  Significant progress has been made on the M1, the M4 and the N2 to Ashbourne.  However, all of us who live in the north west and Border regions are annoyed by the delays in developing the M3.  That road should already be in use.  Commuters from the north west and the Border counties are forced into gridlock on a daily basis.  I am delighted that the development of the road will proceed.  It is regrettable that those who delayed the project have not had to pay the price by having to meet the extra costs which were imposed, such as the extra cost of providing the road.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to respond to the Labour Party&rsquo;s motion on transport in Dublin.  It is worthwhile to reflect on what we mean when we talk about public transport in the city.  While the phrase &ldquo;public transport&rdquo; is most commonly used when talking about buses, trains and now, thankfully, the Luas system, we should bear in mind that there are other categories of public transport.  I remember once reading a gossip column on the back page of a Sunday newspaper.  The columnist wrote that she had been asked at a function a few days earlier when she had last travelled on public transport.  Her response was that she used Aer Lingus quite regularly.  Public transport is all-embracing.  Air and sea travel can be considered as forms of public transport.  There happens to be a major terminus for almost every form of public transport in my constituency.  While there is no sea port in the constituency, such a facility will be developed shortly, all going well.  Public transport is of considerable importance to the people of Dublin North, not only because they depend on <Col N="1244"/>it to get to and from work every day but also because a significant proportion of them work in the transport sector.</P>
        <P>I will put this debate in context by reminding the House how far we have come in a relatively short period of time.  I will use figures from 1997 for the purposes of comparison, rather than to make a political point.  I am taking 1997 as a starting point because I have statistics from that year.  A major programme of expenditure on the national rail network &mdash; it did not just relate to Dublin &mdash; was commenced in 1997.  When we look back at it from this juncture, it is remarkable that we had to spend more than &pound;400 million, or &euro;500 million, to make the rail network safe.  Everyone accepted at the time that such repairs were needed.  I mention such figures to put in context the state our national transport services were in a short time ago.  The problems we faced ten years ago resulted from generations of continual non-investment, as opposed to mere under-funding, by Governments of all hues.  There was a lack of investment for a very good reason &mdash; no money was available.  The investment of money to maintain our public transport network was seen as a luxury when compared to more worthwhile projects in other sectors of the economy.  It is as simple as that.</P>
        <P>One of the great benefits of the arrival of the Celtic tiger &mdash; I will not put a date on its arrival because I do not want to politicise it &mdash; has been the increase in the level of resources available to develop infrastructure in all sectors of the economy.  All one has to do is look around the country to see that the transport sector has got a fair crack of the whip in that regard.  As someone who lives on the north side of Dublin, I have been a regular visitor to the North of Ireland for the last 30 years.  In years gone by, it was always a pleasure to travel to the North.  One could always tell when one had crossed the Border into the North, even if one was asleep in the back of the car, because the road surface there was much better than the road surface in this jurisdiction.  That set of circumstances has now been reversed, thankfully.  Our Northern visitors look on our road network, particularly the M1, with envy.  Similarly, the rail service between Dublin and Belfast is tremendous.  One can make the journey in extreme comfort in two hours, with a high rate of punctuality.  While we have come a long way, we are by no means there yet.  We are playing catch-up in the area of infrastructure, as we are in so many other areas.  I hope the current level of funding will remain on-stream for a long time to come and that the recent investment in transport and other areas can be maintained.</P>
        <P>A cultural shift is necessary in this regard.  When the great success story that is the Luas project was in its planning stages less than ten years ago, nobody thought it was worthwhile to take some considerable care to provide appropriate and adequate park and ride facilities, particularly at outlying Luas stations like Sandyford.  Any <Col N="1245"/>time I have visited the facility that is provided at the Sandyford terminus, I have observed how utterly inadequate it is.  When the facility was being designed, it was considered to be appropriate.  It is the only park and ride facility of any size on the Luas network.  We are learning as we go along.  We are trying to make up for the chronic under-investment or non-investment of years gone by.  A statistic that is sometimes used about the railway service is that not one mile of new railway track was laid in Ireland in the 20th century, whereas several hundred miles of railway track were lifted in the same period.</P>
        <P>I will continue to be somewhat parochial by speaking about the north side of Dublin.  Deputy Ellis referred to the increase of 40% in the capacity of the Dundalk suburban railway line, which is obviously extremely welcome.  A further increase of 40% is needed, however.  I hope that will be facilitated by the construction of the new railway station in the docklands area.  The new station will ease considerably the disproportionate congestion at Connolly Station, which is a major problem for commuters coming into and leaving the city.  The docklands station will be of major benefit to the International Financial Services Centre.  The forthcoming development of the metro north system to Swords should ease dramatically the difficulties experienced by people on the north side.  I urge those who are charged with planning the metro north terminus at Lissenhall to ensure there are adequate park and ride facilities for the projected numbers of metro travellers.  That is particularly important in light of my earlier comments about the park and ride facility at the Sandyford Luas terminus.  The potential for the development of a bus terminus on the Lissenhall site should be fully explored and exploited.  A multi-storey parking facility should be provided there, if necessary, in order that people from the entire north east who travel on the M1 to Swords can continue onwards to the city centre, on the metro or with Dublin Bus via a quality bus corridor.  There would be no excuse for repeating the mistake that was made when the Luas system was being developed at Sandyford.  If such errors are made again, we will all have egg on our faces, to put it mildly.</P>
        <P>While it is expected of us to make some political capital out of the difficulties, if we were all honest with each other, we would realise that mistakes have been made but there has been a massive investment in transport, the benefits of which not only the commuter but the traveller to Dublin from further afield are reaping.  The progress that has been made on the individual projects under the unjustifiably maligned Transport 21 bodes well for the future of transport in the city.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on matters of transport because those of us who represent a Dublin constituency are deeply <Col N="1246"/>concerned about the level of congestion our constituents meet on a daily basis on the M50 or smaller local roads as a result of traffic works or the introduction of quality bus corridors.  I refer in particular to the Rock Road, in my constituency of Blackrock and Booterstown, which causes me great anxiety, and the proposed Mount Merrion Avenue QBC.</P>
        <P>I would like to think we could come up with new ideas on dealing with fast transport corridors because there is no doubt that public transport is the only viable alternative for a major city.  If we are to address the problems of congestion we are dealing with currently and continue to build on the investment made in Transport 21, we will have to come up with proposals that are a little more imaginative.</P>
        <P>I want to refer briefly to the use of bus lanes.  Unfortunately, in my constituency, on the extension of the very successful Stillorgan quality bus corridor it was decided to include a 24 hour bus lane beyond Foxrock church.  I do not know who is responsible for the decision.  I tried to get the council to stop it.  Those 24 hour bus lanes should be banned.  I do not understand why or where in the country we need a 24 hour bus lane.  The day we have 24 hour bus services we might have an argument for 24 hour bus lanes but there is no need for them now.</P>
        <P>We must also examine the way the road surface is used and be able to use it to maximum ability.  I take issue with what is proposed along Mount Merrion Avenue in my constituency.  We must employ systems that work in other countries.  It is never necessary to reinvent the wheel but, unfortunately, we constantly feel the need to do this.</P>
        <P>Essentially, there are three lanes along Mount Merrion Avenue.  It is an old avenue, with a glorious vista down to the sea, and if one stands at the top of it and looks downwards, it typifies our county because it brings one from the mountain to the sea.  It is proposed that some of the trees along the avenue might be cut down to allow for a quality bus corridor.  The project is being delayed because of the strong opposition to it.  A fair amount of negotiation and dealing has been done but we are not quite there yet.</P>
        <P>Why can we not employ the road surface in a flexible manner and have transferable lanes?  There is space for three lanes but there is not enough space for four.  In trying to put a QBC on the road, the trees will have to be cut down and some of the grass verges removed.  I do not believe that is necessary, nor do the people who live on the avenue.</P>
        <P>I would welcome a system where the use of transferable lanes, using new technologies and so on, is encouraged.  That is done in other countries, in particular in Los Angeles.  When I made that suggestion, the point was made to me that it would be impossible to police and people would not observe it.  People adapt quickly and if they are given guidance it would be very easy for them to do it.</P><Col N="1247"/>
        <P>On the use of bus lanes, much of the congestion in the city is construction traffic &mdash; lorries bringing rubble to or taking rubble from construction sites.  A proposal worth examining is that outside peak times heavy goods vehicles should be allowed use those bus lanes.  I accept people might have concerns because, generally speaking, cycle lanes share bus lanes and issues of safety might arise but we could examine that aspect.  The heavy goods vehicles that are carrying these loads cause much of the congestion and we should examine ways of trying to alleviate it.  Roads are about moving traffic, people and goods and we need to maximise our ability to do that.  Studies indicate that construction traffic is at its peak at 1p.m. throughout the city.  The use of bus lanes is clearly compatible for HGV construction traffic in particular.</P>
        <P>In a proper transport system we need to have integrated ticketing.  It is unfortunate we do not; I go back to the point made earlier.  We spent a good deal of money and a lot of time on developing an integrated ticketing system.  That has been done in hundreds of other countries.  I do not understand why it is taking so long to do that here.  It is not fair and I am beginning to think it is in somebody&rsquo;s interests not to have the data available to the Department of Transport that will allow it open up a variety of routes.  There is not a Member in this House who would not support the expansion of bus licensing.</P>
        <P>My view &mdash; this is where I share the perspective of Fine Gael &mdash; is that while we need additional buses they do not necessarily need to be Dublin Bus buses.  I would welcome the introduction of licensing to the private sector.  Fine Gael is to be commended on its attitude in that regard but the Labour Party motion is slightly reckless in that it wants 500 additional buses.  The problem I would have with that is that, as we all know, Dublin Bus demands a subsidy of &euro;100,000 for each bus it puts on the road.</P>

	<P>Where competition in the public services has worked &mdash; Deputy Shortall will be glad to hear me compliment an instance where public competition has worked very well &mdash; is in Irish Rail.  Irish Rail recognised there was competition from other sectors.  It got its act together and as a result, Spencer Dock which under Transport 21 was due to be built by 2009 will open next year.  It is heartening to see a public body change its ways by doing this.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this important motion on public transport in Dublin.  In the two minutes available to me I want to refer specifically to the proposal to expand the Dublin Bus fleet by 50% by introducing an additional 500 buses.  I fully support this proposal and reject the Government&rsquo;s amendment which states 100 extra buses at the end of January 2007 will be adequate to meet the needs of those who wish to use public transport in Dublin.  </P>
        <P>I have been requested by many constituents to draw attention to the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide an acceptable service in at least three areas in a small part of my constituency.  The first is the area in which I live, the Ballybough and Summerhill area in Dublin 1 which is served by the No. 123 bus route which starts in Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s constituency in Marino and Fairview&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1249"/>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>Such is the level of take-up of the service at the Marino end that by the time the bus reaches Ballybough and then Summerhill, it is already full to capacity.  This means effectively that a reliable bus service is being denied to the people of Ballybough, Clonliffe and surrounding areas.  This causes serious hardship to the community, elderly people in particular.  An additional service, specifically for the Ballybough-Clonliffe area, is urgently required.  </P>
        <P>There is a similar situation along parts of the Navan Road in Dublin 7 where at peak hours in the morning when people are trying to get to work, buses coming from Blanchardstown are already full to capacity.  This turns people off and away from using public transport and simply adds to the problem.</P>
        <P>A further area in my constituency, East Wall, has never had a reliable bus service largely because it is an isolated docklands community and Dublin Bus simply does not have sufficient buses to provide the necessary service.  From these three examples in Dublin city, it is evident that Dublin Bus requires an additional 500 buses as presented in the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to speak on the motion which I strongly support because it is important and relevant to the crisis in regard to traffic management and the inadequacy of the public transport system.  Before I go into detail, I wish to state that it is amazing and a bit rich for Members &mdash; they have brass necks &mdash; to come into the House and say we must do this or that we must do that; they are speaking as if they have not been in power for the past nine or ten years.  The Government has had nine years to address this problem but nothing has been done.  I particularly challenge those backbenchers who spoke about transport policy as if they had just arrived on the planet.  The reality is that we need a plan and a vision.  </P>
        <P>I strongly support what my colleague, Deputy Gregory, said about the need to expand the Dublin Bus fleet by 50%.  The No. 123 bus which serves the Marino area fills to capacity very quickly.  We need a proper bus service with an adequate number of buses.</P>
        <P>I also support the introduction of a flat fare of &euro;1 for adults and 50 cent for children.  This is a creative proposal and a sensible idea and its introduction would encourage people to use public transport.</P>
        <P>I also challenge the people concerned regarding the spending of public moneys.  The Dublin Port tunnel project is &euro;250 million over budget.  Some 30 road projects, estimated to cost &euro;932 million, will set everybody back by approximately &euro;2,970 million.  Many road projects were 86% over budget.  It is important to point out that this represents a waste of taxpayer&rsquo;s money.</P><Col N="1250"/>
        <P>With regard to big projects, I am mindful of the concerns expressed by local residents, particularly in Marino, Fairview and Santry.  Some 273 homes have been damaged.  Cracks are appearing in walls, including kitchen walls, and nobody is saying anything about it.  I strongly support the local residents concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Labour Party motion and many of the public transport elements of Transport 21.  However, there is no doubt that there is a need for an immediate response because the problem in public transport is of emergency proportions.  We need more buses now.  The Dublin Bus network review proposed the introduction of 200 new buses earlier this year, but only 100 were introduced following a row between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats during the summer.  Worse still, licences for new routes are being issued under the 1932 Act, with 27 issued this year to private operators, on whom there is no obligation to operate an integrated ticketing system, on which the State has spent more than &euro;10 million without any obvious result.  They are also not obliged to carry people with bus passes.  Every operator will have his or her bus stops, timetables and will decide the fares to be charged and fare increases.  By the time competitive tendering is introduced, there will be nothing left for which to tender.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">This fragmented approach is not in the interests of the commuter.  There are two bus operators in my area and a commuter has to decide to which of the two bus stops he or she should run to catch a bus.  That is no way to run a public transport system.  The 15% of non-Dublin bus services must be integrated in a way that is in the interests of the commuter.</P>
        <P>There is a problem in regard to car parking in the vicinity of every train station or bus terminal.  In a sense, this indicates a success story because it is evidence of people&rsquo;s desire to use public transport.  More car parking spaces are needed now, not in a few years&rsquo; time.  Such facilities can be provided.</P>
        <P>A two tier fare system is in place on rail and bus suburban services.  For example, commuters from Kilcock and Sallins, not as long a journey from the city centre as Balbriggan, pay substantially more for the service.  An adult fare from Balbriggan to the city centre is &euro;3.60, while an adult fare for the shorter journey from Sallins or Kilcock is &euro;6.  A journey with one stop between Hazelhatch and Sallins costs an adult commuter &euro;8.  This is the reason more people do not use public transport.  A fair pricing system must operate.</P>
        <P>With regard to the West Link Bridge toll, the Government collected &euro;8 million in tolls in 2004 and &euro;15 million in 2005.  An additional 6,000 additional vehicles will travel on M50 by the end of this month.  At this stage, the Government should realise the game is up.  Tolls need to be removed now.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1251"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the motion.  This issue affects us all, even though I live in Monaghan.  People from my area can now travel to Dublin in a shorter time.  The journey to the airport now only takes one and a half hours because the construction of bypasses has led to improved journey times.  If people want to travel south from Monaghan to Wexford, they will encounter traffic, with commuters travelling to and from work in Dublin.  A bypass or outer ring road bypassing Dublin further along the route is needed.  The payment of tolls also slows up traffic.  It does not make sense for people to be caught in traffic for a long period queuing to pay a tax to commute to and from work.  One can travel through other cities much quicker owning to the fact that they tend to make better use of flyovers and bypasses than we do.  </P>
        <P>We could improve the position by establishing a public agency to co-ordinate the operation of trams, trains and buses.  The motion also proposes the introduction of additional buses, for which there is a great need in Dublin.  Somebody mentioned a figure of &euro;50 million per year.  If such a cost resulted in people getting to and from work in a shorter time, it would be taxpayer&rsquo;s money well spent.  That is what a good public transport system is about.</P>
        <P>A more frequent service is required on bus routes and the service should commence earlier in the morning and continue later at night.  We also need a more equitable pricing system.  It is not equitable that a worker and a child are required to pay the same fare; a child should pay half the adult fare.  That would make sense.</P>
        <P>Train stations are a target for criminals.  Additional staff should be employed to ensure commuters who travel by train will feel safe, particularly vulnerable commuters travelling late at night.</P>
        <P>I waited with bated breath to see how Operation Freeflow would work out but it does not appear to be working well.  It does not appear to be the success that it was advertised or intended to be.  The aim was certainly laudable, but it has not worked.</P>
        <P>However unpalatable it might be, we must look at what has worked in London.  A congestion charge was introduced and it appears to be popular with people.  We should look at this if we want to free up our cities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The greatest failure of the Government is in the area of transport and land use planning.  It will leave us a legacy of a difficult, impaired quality of life for generations to come.  I would not put the Members opposite me who have acted as Ministers in charge of a car park in an empty field at a garden fete.  They have proved themselves incompetent, witless, illogical, uninspired, craven to vested interests and, on crucial occasions, corrupt in some of the decisions that they have made to my mind.  They have left <Col N="1252"/>us with the massive problem that we can see developing every day on our roads.</P>
        <P>The reasons for that failure are clear.  There has been an absolute lack of investment in public transport.  In 2006 we will spend six times more on new roads than on public transport in the capital programme.  Even though we have set aside a significant sum of money for public transport next year, I do not believe it will be spent because no rail projects will be developed, such is the poor planning that has taken place.  I mentioned corruption because it is part of the problem.  If we look at the planning that has accompanied road development, we notice that major stores have been put adjacent to motorways against the best planning advice, which is now causing much of our gridlock problems.</P>
        <P>There is also a broader planning failure as the Government starved cities such as Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and elsewhere, which could have been real alternatives to Dublin.  These are centres where we could provide public transport and other services to attract development and investment away from the capital city.  I pity the next Government that has to undo and repair this damage, as it will have a very difficult task.</P>
        <P>I agree with the broad intent of the Labour Party motion, but I disagree with one aspect.  I do not believe that park and ride facilities will provide a substantial solution to our problems.  It has been proven in many international reports that they do not provide significant capacity, that they cost a great amount in land use and provision and people simply do not use them to the extent required to provide a real solution.  The main solution will be in the provision of fixed rail services, which will allow for a fast and high quality public transport system, with the development of the crucial softer modes of walking and cycling.  In conjunction with proper planning, these modes of transport can deliver a healthy, vigorous, economically advantaged city.</P>
        <P>Bus services provide a crucial interim measure which will help us get through the difficult times this Government&rsquo;s bad planning will cause.  We need an emergency plan to provide bus services to try to take people off the road and reduce current congestion, while waiting for the development of long-term rail solutions.  That will require flexibility in the running of bus services, which should involve a regulator establishing new bus routes and directing Dublin Bus and private operators to alter services so that more frequent, high quality services can be provided.  To do that, we need to provide radical road space for such services to make sure they arrive on time.</P>
        <P>I was flabbergasted at the latest ideas of Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley on how the problem might be solved, when her party has utterly failed in government to do anything about it for the last ten years.  It is interesting to look at the manifesto of the Progressive Democrats Party in 2002, which promised a metro and all sorts of rail and bus services by 2007.  In five years the party has <Col N="1253"/>done nothing.  The people should vote on that legacy on transport planning next May, by voting this incompetent Government out of office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>If one does not own a car in Dublin, one&rsquo;s options in employment, shopping, education and social opportunities are severely limited.  People will only leave their cars at home if public transport is an attractive alternative.  Due to failed transport policies by this and other Governments, owning a car is no longer a luxury but a necessity for many people.  The 20% of households without cars are marginalised as a result of Dublin being an extreme example of a car-dependent city.  Dublin transport systems are being starved of adequate funding for decades and Dublin is creaking from the pressure, with daily congestion problems and gridlock infuriating commuters.</P>
        <P>It took three hours for buses to get from the Ringsend depot to Tallaght on 20 November, a journey that would normally take one hour and 20 minutes.  This was due to roadworks being carried out during the day outside the bus depot.  No doubt it was more cost effective for the contractor to carry out the work during the busiest time of the day, but what of the cost to the rest of us?  Bus drivers and passengers are frustrated and under pressure, stuck in traffic jams while quality bus corridors lie empty in parts of the city.  The Dublin Bus fleet has remained constant, with 50 additional buses delivered since 2001.  The recently announced decision, after much procrastination, to deliver an extra 100 buses is long overdue.  Buses can deliver short-term benefits at low cost.</P>
        <P>As has been proven in other cities like Brussels and Zurich, the public transport system can be efficiently run by the public sector.  We have only had to look at the private transport initiatives in Britain, which proved disastrous as safety standards were lowered, wages and passenger numbers decreased, fares rose while jobs were lost.  According to subsequent cases, lives were also lost in the pursuit of profit.  Dublin Bus receives one of the lowest State subsidies in Europe.  It receives less than half the subsidies of cities like Stockholm, which has an excellent public transport system.  Dublin Bus does not need the failed transport model of privatisation, but appropriate State investment.  Through such investment, the quality of life for all of our citizens will be drastically improved by a reliable, safe, efficient, fast, clean and affordable transport system.</P>
        <P>I support the proposal of making public transport affordable, as it is an obvious way to attract more people to avail of it.  We currently have some of the highest bus and rail fares in Europe, hitting those on low incomes the hardest, as they must rely on that form of transport.  Dublin Bus recently requested a 10% fare increase, which is a direct result of the fact that our public bus company is under-funded by the Government.  I share <Col N="1254"/>the view that we should encourage greater use of public transport.  One way to do that is by decreasing fares.</P>
        <P>There is a lack of integration in our public transport system, if it could be called a system.  In many other European countries, a single ticket allows one to travel by bus, metro and rail.  We in this State urgently need integrated ticketing and co-ordinated timetables between our different modes of transport.  There also needs to be a direct link between land use, planning and transport provision to ensure that no new large developments are built without transport access.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke about the Rail Procurement Agency and the extension of the Luas line in Tallaght, which was welcomed by everyone.  However, it will only be a spur off the existing service.  The Minister of State failed to mention that this is being funded by local developers.  While I have no problem with that, many of the green spaces in south Dublin will be filled in with more and more houses, factories and shops to pay for it.</P>
        <P>I support the Labour Party motion as it is an attempt to deal with the problem that exists.  Most people who use public transport experience that problem.  Instead of matters improving, they are getting worse.  The journey from Tallaght was re-routed via Ringsend from the quays, but there is no QBC, which will be introduced in a few months.  The Tallaght buses are now coming into town via Pearse Street, one of the most congested parts of the city.  It is difficult to go on a bicycle along that street, not to mention a car or a bus.  This adds to the frustration of the drivers and those who must travel along that route.</P>
        <P>We need more buses.  The best way of getting those buses is through the public sector.  That means the Government and the taxpayer paying for a better service.  The Minister of State indicated that people were increasingly using the service.  If it improves, is safe, clean and affordable, people will use it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to share time with Deputies Wall, Lynch and Broughan. </P>
        <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Shortall, on behalf of the Labour Party, for bringing this motion before the House and producing a policy document on bus transport for the greater Dublin area that is simple, practical and the aims of which would be achievable in the short term.  It is a proposal that recognises Dublin has spread way beyond the old city boundaries and the reality of daily commuting for tens of thousands of workers.  It is a proposal that recognises the need to take urgent action to ease congestion and traffic jams on roads into and within the city and seeks a positive and achievable solution for many now trapped in daily gridlock.  It is a proposal that recognises that the workhorse of the public transport system will remain for some time the bus service provided by Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P><Col N="1255"/>
        <P>This is a positive, realistic and achievable proposal from the Labour Party and when in government next year we will implement it.  We will provide an additional 500 buses for Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath.  The Fianna-F&aacute;il led Government provided 20 extra buses in the last five years.  We will extend their operational area to cover a 25-mile circle around Dublin city.  This will include areas in my constituency such as Celbridge, Leixlip, Maynooth, Naas and Kilcock and extend to Sallins, Prosperous, Clane and Straffan.  It will also extend to south Meath, where our colleague, Councillor Dominic Hannigan, has been campaigning for public transport reform and provision.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposal on public transport includes a provision in respect of strategically placed park and ride facilities in order that long distance commuters, visitors and shoppers would be able to drive to the outer city ring and get buses from there into the city, leaving their cars in secure locations, while reducing congestion in the city area.  The proposal would introduce for the first time a flat rate fare of &euro;1 for a 25-mile journey.  This would simplify the present system and remove the anomalies highlighted by Deputy Shortall.  In my area it costs nearly twice as much to travel from Dublin to Kilcock as it does from Dublin to Maynooth.  The new system would not only be fairer, it would also provide real financial encouragement for commuters to leave their cars behind and take the bus.  Not only would the Labour Party proposal provide for 50% more buses and a fare rate that would encourage their use, it would also reduce bus travelling times by completing the quality bus corridors, thereby providing certainty.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has traditionally been and is now the champion of public transport.  It believes public transport is a service best provided by the public sector.  As a service, it should be efficient, cost effective and attractive.  It is not possible to achieve these aims, provide a universal service and make a profit.  We should now accept that the aims of being cost effective and profitable are not synonymous.  The cost savings from a good universal public transport system would not be seen on the balance sheet of any company.  These savings would be seen in the time saved by bus users, the reduction of stress as traffic congestion is eased and the quality of life of road users.  Surely, if there had been a three-hour wait on the then equivalent of the M4, it would have been included in the horrors of Dante&rsquo;s Inferno.</P>
        <P>All good universal public transport systems are supported by public funds, an investment from which the taxpayer gets a good return.  Of course, the private sector can make a profit if it is allowed to cherrypick the best routes.  The last time it went universal, however, it went broke and CIE was established in its stead.</P>
        <P>I again thank Deputy Shortall for bringing this motion before the House and presenting Labour <Col N="1256"/>Party policy on bus transport which would provide for 50% more buses, a flat fare of &euro;1, full length quality bus corridors and park and ride facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, congratulate our colleague, Deputy Shortall, for the document she has put before the House tonight.  It is positive in its proposals and realistic as regards the timescale for its implementation.  It is, perhaps, unusual to see someone from a rural background addressing the House on Dublin Bus.  However, when one has to access the capital on a daily basis or a number of times per week, one knows one is interested in the traffic problems within the city.  Obviously, a quality bus service would have this as its basic aim. </P>
        <P>Each morning I leave Athy I face a necklace of tail lights.  When one arrives at the dual carriageway, however, there are few buses in evidence providing a link between Kildare and the capital.  The traffic tails back four or five miles each morning of the working week, from Newlands Cross to Brown&rsquo;s Barn at the entrance to Citywest and the situation appears to be getting worse all the time.  I just cannot see any improvement.  There is no linkage.  As regards Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s proposals, if a park and ride facility was to be introduced in respect of the M50, such an initiative could only improve the circumstances of those trying to reach their place of employment at a reasonable hour.  There is a quality bus corridor along the Long Mile Road which has been marked for four months, although I stand to be corrected on this.   However, there are signs stating it is not in use, while the traffic jams continue and buses get caught up in the congestion every morning &mdash; from the South Circular Road to Clanbrassil Street and Wexford Street.  There is no organisation.  The Labour Party proposals, if implemented, would result in immediate improvements for commuters.</P>
        <P>Because of the lack of effort on the part of the Government to ensure decentralisation of employment from the city, the congestion will continue into the foreseeable future.  Unless we really attack the problems as regards quality bus corridors, the provision of extra buses and park and ride facilities, the city will slowly but surely come to a halt.  It takes at least an hour any evening to get from Leinster House to the dual carriageway on the Naas Road.  It is unbelievable in the modern city Dublin is becoming that the lack of a quality bus service means gridlock and that the quality bus lanes depicted in the document are not available.</P>
        <P>I have asked Deputy Shortall about the Imp buses which certainly appeared to deliver a service in the city.  However, because of the financial implications for Dublin Bus, they seem to have been gradually removed from the system and they have not been replaced by a modern fleet that might make a difference.  No new buses have been introduced.  There is, therefore, no <Col N="1257"/>incentive on offer to use the public transport system.  That is one of the problems.  However, the document sets out to do this.  As such, I strongly support the initiative proposed by Deputy Shortall.  I hope that when in government the Labour Party will ensure its proposals are implemented.</P>

	<P>I also commend my colleague, Deputy Shortall, on her excellent Labour Party policy document, Getting Dublin Moving, and tabling the motion before the House.  If the measures proposed were implemented, they would play a major role in combating the ever increasing congestion on our city streets and, in a matter in which I am also interested, helping to reduce our energy consumption and carbon emissions.  A well funded, cheap and reliable public transport network would be a key foundation stone of any low or zero carbon economy and society.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>In recent decades the public transport system has been starved of necessary funding by Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Ministers.  Effectively, Transport 21 is pie in the sky and provides no solace for harassed and angry commuters in the short to medium term.  They will face a daily nightmarish trek in getting to and from work.  I hope metro north will arrive on time in 2012.  The linkage of the green and red Luas lines should also occur at approximately the same time.  Even Blanchardstown and west Dublin may receive a much needed DART system.  However, what will happen to commuters in this gridlocked city in the intervening years?  Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s solution, namely, the provision of 500 buses and a &euro;1 fare, appears to be the only feasible one to get people out of cars in the short to medium term.</P>
        <P>Many residents on the western side of my constituency of Dublin North-East are bitterly disappointed by the metro north decision.  As the Ceann Comhairle is aware, there was intense competition in the consultation process between proponents of the three possible routes.  The proposed eastern route ran through Whitehall, Coolock and Clonshaugh; the central route ran through Glasnevin and Ballymun, while the western route ran through Finglas.  Strong arguments were made for all three routes and I congratulate the people of Ballymun, their residents associations and representative bodies, for convincing the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, to formally propose the central route as the preferred option.  Of course, I also congratulate Deputy Shortall as their representative.</P>
        <P>Metro north will be a terrific asset to all the districts and communities along its route, including Drumcondra, Glasnevin, Dublin City University, Ballymun, west Santry, Northwood, Nevinstown and Swords.  However, this means the greater Coolock district does not and will not have a fixed line transport system.  Consequently, I again call on the RPA to return to the Dublin Transportation Office strategy to 2016, A Platform for Change, which includes the provision of <Col N="1258"/>a Luas line that would run across the top of what has become, to an increasing extent, a major new region of the city.  It stretches from the eastern side of my constituency to the western side of the constituency of Dublin North-West.  Many enormous developments are under way, particularly at Northside Shopping Centre, and it seems incredible to construct a major new urban centre without having a fixed rail link.  I again call on the Railway Procurement Agency&rsquo;s chairman, Mr. Padraic White, to immediately resurrect the Coolock Luas proposal.</P>
        <P>I have received many complaints in recent months regarding gross overcrowding on the DART line that runs through my constituency and the health and safety issues involved when passengers are stuffed like sardines into trains at rush hour.  While the commencement of work on the Malahide to Greystones link was welcomed, the upshot was the Dublin North-East constituency lost approximately 18 trains, nine in the morning and nine in the afternoon.  I have called and again call on the CIE chairman, Dr. John Lynch, to ensure he will try to increase the availability of rolling stock on the Donaghmede to Howth lines.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also warmly welcomed the DASH project, under which stations were upgraded.  Seven or eight years ago I called on the former Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, to try to provide the north side of Dublin with railway stations constructed to the same finish as those on the south side.  At long last the DASH project followed through in this regard.  However, much unfinished business remains, particularly regarding Bayside station, in which a major drain was burst asunder by DASH project workers.  Despite campaigning for two years via endless e-mails, telephone calls and attempts to contact CIE management, it still has not been repaired.  In addition, park and ride facilities are required at Raheny and Donaghmede stations.  An opportunity arose to create such facilities, which would have been highly beneficial for the entire DART network.  However, once again, CIE, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council signally failed to pursue the matter.</P>
        <P>The Ceann Comhairle will have heard me discuss the northern fringe many times.  It is a new city of perhaps 20,000 to 25,000 housing units, a key element of which should be a new railway station which is already two or three years behind schedule.  It is a key piece of infrastructure for the northern fringe.  I again call on the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to try to ensure a new DART station will be secured for the new Clongriffin town centre with its growing population.  Incidentally, a new bus route has been promised for the area, with buses to be provided from the 100 new buses.  However, while the DART line is already <i>in situ</i>, there is no station.  If a new city is to be developed, key pieces of infrastructure are essential.</P>
        <P>I commend Deputy Shortall on an extremely well thought out proposal for the intervening <Col N="1259"/>years up to 2012 or thereabouts.  I also congratulate her for bringing it before the public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>In common with my Labour Party colleagues, I congratulate Deputy Shortall.  It seems incredible that Members should be obliged to devote so much time to something which should be an asset, namely, transport and how one can travel from point A to point B.  This has become the bane of people&rsquo;s lives.  How can one get to work or the shops or visit relatives?  It has become an impossible task.</P>
        <P>While the motion under discussion is flagged clearly as one to deal with transport problems in Dublin, I wish to talk briefly about three areas in my constituency of Cork North-Central.  For instance, Glanmire is one of the fastest growing areas outside of Dublin and now has a population of 30,000.  The community is mixed, as originally it was an old community but has become a community of young commuters.  While it has a growing youth population, the only bus service available to it is one that originally serviced and still services a rural area.  Although I would love to be in a position to discuss light rail, Cork is not at that point.  If one is lucky, the bus comes once an hour.  To ensure one gets onto the bus at the morning peak times, one must be driven one mile down the road to meet the bus.  Even if one manages eventually to get a seat or simply get on the bus, as most people must stand, it will not reach the Cork Institute of Technology, one of the third level institutions, in time for lectures.  This is incredible.</P>
        <P>In the Cork North-Central district of Farranree the established bus service has been cut back so badly that one could be obliged to wait for anything up to one and a quarter hours for a bus.  While Farranree had a regular bus service, it has been so deprived of money that it is now worse than it has ever been in the lifetime of that community.  Any new buses that come on stream replace buses that have become so clapped out that they now constitute a health hazard.</P>
        <P>I refer to Watergrasshill which is slightly outside my constituency and which has become a victim of a bypass.  Originally it was served by a bypass, namely, the Watergrasshill bypass, which worked well.  However, the Government decided to toll the road which has now become the Fermoy bypass.  In so doing, to ensure the road tollers would have sufficient traffic to make it financially viable, the Government handed over the Watergrasshill bypass to those who now own the toll road.  This has ensured traffic that does not wish to use the toll road now comes thundering through Watergrasshill.</P>
        <P>I visited Watergrasshill last week.  It is a small rural village with only one street.  One can no longer hold a conversation at the side of the road because of the volume of noise and trucks thundering through the village.  This is a consequence of putting in place a toll road that effectively has split a community in two and has made the village <Col N="1260"/>unsafe for people to walk in.  It is a beautiful village but the residents&rsquo; entire lifestyle has been taken away as a result of a toll road.  They wish to meet the Minister, as they believe him to be singularly responsible for this state of affairs.  They wish to do so after Christmas and he should accede to their request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, outlined the measures taken since 1997 to improve the transport system in the Dublin area and the measures planned under Transport 21.  Some Opposition Deputies claimed, however, that nothing was being done to address transport needs, although they acknowledged Transport 21 as the way forward.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Some of the larger rail based Transport 21 projects will take time to implement, but in the meantime many other public transport upgrade projects will be implemented, while progress on the roads programme will be maintained.  Tonight, therefore, I propose to set out in more detail the measures being taken which will be funded in 2007 from the record capital provision of &euro;2.2 billion in the Estimates for the transport sector.  This will, <i>inter alia</i>, fund a range of major projects in the Dublin area.  </P>
        <P>Work will be completed around March on the Docklands station.  This will improve services on the Maynooth line and enable in due course the provision of services to Dunboyne and Navan.  Work will commence on the four-tracking &mdash; quadrupling &mdash; of the Kildare line to Hazelhatch.  This will enable the separation of long distance Intercity trains and commuter trains to substantially increase the capacity of the lines terminating at Heuston Station.  The completion of the Kildare route project in 2010 will see peak hour passenger capacity rise from 2,000 in 2005 to 5,300 in 2010 and 9,300 in 2016.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Work will commence on upgrading the signalling system in the city centre area.  This will increase capacity in the critical city centre area, between Connolly and Pearse Stations, through the upgrading of signalling systems so as to accommodate 16 trains per hour in each direction, instead of the current capacity of 12 trains in each direction per hour.  DART services, as well as Northern and Maynooth commuter services, will benefit.</P>
        <P>Additional car parking spaces will be provided at various locations throughout the network, including Leixlip Louisabridge where work has begun.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been ongoing for seven years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A programme of car park expansions is being finalised by larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and <Col N="1261"/>will provide the basis for a programme of car park extensions in the Dublin area and throughout the country.  Major projects such as the Kildare route project also include the provision of increased car parking spaces at new stations.  </P>
        <P>Funding will be provided in 2007 for the purchase of additional and replacement buses by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  All of the 100 additional buses being purchased by Dublin Bus will enter into service in the early part of 2007.  Some of the 160 new buses to be purchased by Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2007 will be deployed in the Dublin area.  There will also, as outlined last night, be further major investment in bus priority and traffic management measures, with priority being given to pinch points that are reducing bus speeds.</P>
        <P>In addition, planning and design work on the Clonsilla-Dunboyne rail link and the interconnector and electrification project will continue.  The position on the Clonsilla-Dunboyne project is that larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has been given approval to begin detailed design work and bring the project to railway order stage.  It is expected that the company will submit its railway order application in mid-2007.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Meath County Council have developed terms of reference for a scoping study for phase 2, the extension to Navan, work on which is also to commence in 2007.</P>
        <P>Much of the discussion last night focused on bus services.  Buses are and will remain the workhorse of the public transport system in Dublin.  They are carrying nearly 150 million passengers per annum, an increase from 137 million in 1997.  Quality bus corridors, QBCs, have assisted in this growth.  According to DTO data, the number of bus passengers on QBCs increased by nearly 50% between 1997 and 2004.  Recent DTO reports indicate that bus and other forms of public transport account for around 21% of work trips in the Dublin area compared to about 55% for cars and about 13% for walking, with cycling and mixed modes accounting for the balance.  The Government is committed and providing the capital and current funding to extend and upgrade bus services.</P>
        <P>Concerns were expressed by some Deputies about the impact of major projects such as the M50 upgrade on traffic flows.  I appreciate these concerns but it must also be acknowledged that good efforts are being made to minimise these impacts and that the experience gained from other projects successfully delivered in live traffic conditions such as the Naas Road upgrade has helped the NRA and its contractors to ensure major necessary improvement projects can be undertaken on roads that are in use while maintaining traffic flow.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency is making good progress on the roll-out of the Luas and metro projects provided for in Transport 21.  Projects for early delivery include the extension of the trams on the Luas red &mdash; Tallaght &mdash; line from 30 to 40 metres which will provide an additional 40% capacity.  The first 40 metre trams <Col N="1262"/>will be delivered early in 2007 and all tram extensions will be completed by 2008.  Additional trams will be purchased to increase capacity on both Luas lines.</P>
        <P>It is important to demonstrate to the House that Transport 21 contains short-term, medium-term and long-term solutions, all of which will transform completely the travelling public&rsquo;s experience, both in Dublin and throughout the country, on a myriad of transport modes.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is regrettable that the Minister is simply reiterating points made in the past, when the idea behind the motion is to bring forward immediate realistic measures that could prove to be effective in their simplicity &mdash; 500 more buses, a flat &euro;1 fare, the opening up of QBCs and providing park and ride facilities.  It is regrettable that he does not seem to be listening.  It is important to point out that these are measures which could be taken immediately, but they are also in line with a basic principle that should underline transport policy that we should aim to make every journey safer, quicker and cheaper than by car on which as we all know from experience we are over-reliant.</P>
        <P>Sometimes the lesson is learned painfully that we must do things differently.  I cite the example of an event which occurred on 22 November which affected County Wicklow, in particular, but also those dependent on the M50 to get home in the evening.  It is reckoned that 40,000 were affected by the unprecedented gridlock.  It was unsafe having so many people, some of whom were accompanied by young children, stuck in a queue trying to get home for up to seven hours.  Among them were people who were sick, elderly persons and people with diabetes.  They were stuck in a way that nobody in a modern society should ever expect to experience.  It does not seem to set off alarm bells with the Government, but then there is an air of complacency about it, at which I suppose we should not be surprised.</P>
        <P>I wrote to the Dublin City Council manager asking for an independent review of what had gone wrong.  Of course, I did not get this, but I <Col N="1263"/>received an in-house response in which the city manager made some interesting points.  The cause of the emergency, the burst waterpipe, was known 24 hours before work began but the council decided not to work at night-time for health and safety reasons.  That is incredible.  There was nothing more unsafe than what happened.  Given that modern machinery incorporate lights, it does not make that one could not have done this work at night-time.</P>
        <P>Communication between the two local authorities involved was by email.  There was poor communication and even worse traffic management.  A contraflow system should have been put in place, but that did not happen.</P>

	<P>It will take a long time, beyond the next general election, and, I hope, a change of Government for those in Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats to finally figure out that it is a matter, not just of spending money and publishing major reports with many diagrams of Luas lines but of better management to ensure simple measures are taken to make a difference.  That is the virtue of the proposal in the Labour Party motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shortall, for proposing the motion.</P>
        <P>I want to pick up on the final straightforward point made by Deputy McManus on the need for joined up thinking between the local authorities and public transport services.  A consultant&rsquo;s report was commissioned to examine the transport problems and daily gridlock in the Terenure area.  Terenure is in my constituency and has an overlap between two local authorities.  That consultant&rsquo;s report is gathering dust somewhere and there has been no movement whatsoever on it.</P>
        <P>We need more buses to alleviate the frustration drivers feel whenever they are stuck in traffic beside an empty bus lane.  More buses are what we need to convince drivers they will be better off leaving their cars at home.  We need 500 more buses and we need them immediately.  We need buses which disabled people can use.  While I <Col N="1264"/>realise such buses are slowly being rolled out, I receive regular complaints about the lack of such a facility.  We need buses which sell and accept Luas, DART and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann tickets.</P>
        <P>We need buses which arrive on time.  We need timetables that indicate when a bus is supposed to arrive at a bus stop, not when it is supposed to have left the terminus.  We need real-time information at bus stops, like that on the Luas, telling users when the next bus will arrive.  The number of buses which do not arrive on time, or at all, in my constituency seems to be as bad as it was 20 years ago.</P>
        <P>In 1854 omnibuses left Terenure every half hour and by 1857 there was one every 15 minutes.  Today, according to a Dublin Bus timetable, rush hour is the only time when there are four 15A buses per hour travelling from Terenure into town.  Those buses end up in gridlock because of the lack of QBCs, or incomplete QBCs, that afford priority to buses.  When one adds the uncertainty that the bus one is waiting for might have left the terminus early, or may not have left it at all, one is left with the conclusion that our bus service is no better than it was more than 100 years ago.</P>
        <P>The Luas runs through a significant part of my constituency and is a very welcome innovation.  It is reliable and the commuter actually knows when the next one is due to arrive.  However, we need Luas trams which are not so full that four or five can pass during rush hour before one can, by pushing and shoving, somehow manoeuvre oneself into the carriage.  I have had two complaints in the last week from constituents who had to allow three trams go by because they were so overcrowded.</P>
        <P>We need a fairer fare system.  As Deputy Shortall has already suggested, we need a &euro;1 fare which allows one to travel anywhere in Dublin.  We also need park and ride facilities that will allow motorists the facility to leave their cars in a secure location, sufficiently far from the city centre to avoid more congestion.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 delivered only 17 new buses in 2005 and 15 this year and, in both cases, the buses were not operational until November or December.  The same Transport 21 seems to have overlooked large segments of my constituency &mdash; there are no plans for Luas or metro for the Terenure, Kimmage, Harold&rsquo;s Cross or Walkinstown areas.  When one looks at the map setting out the plans for transport, there is a gap in my constituency that, a constituent remarked, looks like the Phoenix Park.  I recently asked a question about this, and the Minister assured me that buses were the way to go in this area.  However, when I asked him about the number of buses, he told me that it was nothing to do with him and was solely a matter for Dublin Bus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies are very critical.  I thought they were supporters of the State bus company.  This is a rant against the company for failing to do its job properly.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are great supporters of Dublin Bus.  However, it is of little use if there are not enough buses, we do not know when they are due, where they are going or at what time they leave their terminus.  While we support Dublin Bus, we are seeking an efficient service and a reasonable fare.</P>
        <P>Dublin needs to get cars off its streets but it is pointless to blame motorists for taking their cars when there is no reliable, accessible and reasonably priced public transport alternative.  Until that is available, all of us &mdash; commuters, businesses and tourists &mdash; will continue to suffer the consequences and the daily grind of gridlock.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Members who participated in this debate.  It is an important issue and it is clear from the emotive nature of the contributions by Members on all sides of the House that transport is a burning issue across the greater Dublin area.  It is the one issue that affects more people than any other because traffic congestion and inadequate transport services affect the lives of most people living in the greater Dublin area on a daily basis.  Whether it is getting to and from work, going shopping or visiting family, travelling from A to B is becoming an increasingly difficult task.</P>
        <P>The complete absence of any co-ordinated Government strategy on land use and transport has resulted in housing development being entirely developer-led.  More and more families have been forced out to the towns and villages of Meath, Kildare, Wicklow and further afield in order to find affordable housing.  However, in many cases they discover there are no transport or inadequate transport services available.  Therefore, more people are being forced to commute by car over longer distances on increasingly gridlocked roads.</P>
        <P>People are paying dearly for the Government&rsquo;s failure in transport.  They are paying through their pockets with ever escalating commuting costs.  More importantly, because of the Govern<Col N="1266"/>ment&rsquo;s failure, people are paying high personal costs in terms of longer working days, lost family time, lost leisure time, higher stress levels and undoubtedly a poorer quality of life.  The business community estimates that congestion is costing the economy some &euro;2 billion annually and business interests have said that it is getting to the point where it is impossible to do business properly within the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks we witnessed the catastrophic consequences of relatively minor traffic incidents, namely, the roadworks on the N11 referred to by Deputy McManus, and a single overturned car on the M50.  Each of these incidents brought traffic across Dublin to a standstill.  This kind of disruption is going to become increasingly common unless action is taken in the short-term.</P>
        <P>The response of the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues has been to announce the grand plan, Transport 21.  The vast bulk of the &euro;34 billion allocated is being spent on road projects, even though we know roads are not the solution to transport in the greater Dublin area.  The balance of the money is predominantly for rail projects.  We do not argue with the Minister on the latter as there is a need for all those projects.  However, we are long past time for starting an underground metro system that has been talked about for 20 or 30 years.  It is time work started on such projects.</P>
        <P>We support the extension of Luas.  We support the additional rail capacity that is planned.  We recognise that those decisions have finally been taken.  They should have been taken eight or nine years ago.  However, we recognise, just as the Minister should, that in terms of bringing relief across the greater Dublin area we will not see return on those decisions for many years, even if they are brought to fruition.  The Minister will forgive us for being sceptical.  One need only look at what happened to Platform for Change.  This was another grand plan and great promises were made, but it was not delivered.</P>
        <P>Even if the Transport 21 proposals are delivered on time, we will not see any relief for the next five to ten years.  We will continue to have an emergency for five, six or seven years unless action is taken.  The difficulty arises from the fact that the Minister does not seem to appreciate the need for immediate emergency action.  What is happening on a daily basis in the greater Dublin area cannot be allowed to continue and the Minister must do something about it.</P>
        <P>In proposing the motion before the House, the Labour Party outlines very clear steps that could be taken to bring forward immediate bus-based solutions.  It can be done.  The Labour Party has produced a plan and calls on the Minister to take it on board.  It is a plan for more buses, faster buses and cheaper fares.  That is the only sustainable solution to Dublin&rsquo;s gridlock problems for the next five, seven or eight years.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to take action and I commend the motion to the House.</P>

        <P>Deputies will recall that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003 provided for the setting up of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to administer the running of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The commission came into being on 1 January 2004 and was provided with the necessary funds to carry out its functions for three years from that date.  The initial three-year period will come to an end on 31 December 2006.  Accordingly, an amendment to the 2003 Act is required to provide the commission with a fresh injection of funds so that it can continue its work for a further three years from 1 January 2007.  It is for this reason that the Bill is before the House.</P>

	<P>The commission is composed of 11 members, ten of whom are Members of either the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  These include the Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Chairman of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and one Member appointed by the Minister for Finance.  The remaining seven members &mdash; four from the D&aacute;il and three from the Seanad &mdash; are appointed from the Members of each House.  The 11th member is the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, who is designated as the Secretary General of the commission.</P>
        <P>The amount proposed for the commission for the three years 2007-09 is &euro;393 million.</P>

	<P>The responsibilities of the commission include payment of the salaries and <Col N="1270"/>allowances of Deputies and Senators and payment of the salaries of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The general election in 2007&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and a European election in 2009 will place extra financial burdens on the commission, for which the funding allocation provided for in the Bill will also cater.  One item to note in the Bill is in section 3, where the functions of the commission are expanded to include the provision of translation services in respect of Acts of the Oireachtas.  It is appropriate that the commission should have this function and it is taken into account in the funding to be provided.</P>
        <P>The Bill also includes some minor amendments to a number of sections of the 2003 Act.  In most cases their purpose is to provide clarification of functions or procedures where this has been considered desirable in the interests of full clarity and transparency.</P>
        <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  It will enable the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to continue with its excellent work which, as Members on all sides will agree, has proven to be of great benefit to parliamentarians of both Houses over the past three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2006.  I declare an interest in that I have been a member of the commission since its foundation three years ago.  It has been an honour to work with my colleagues and the Ceann Comhairle, who acts as chairman of the commission, to organise and run the Houses.</P>
        <P>This has been a period of transition for Oireachtas Members.  We have broken new ground in many areas and had to deal with difficult issues on occasion.  Overall, it is a tribute to all those involved that we have only seen serious disagreement on one issue on one occasion in those three years.</P>
        <P>We had a budget for the past three years of &euro;293 million and it is important to note that we came in substantially under budget, despite the fact that we embarked on many new ventures in that period, taking on additional staff and expenditure.  We have bolstered the Oireachtas Library service, something of a swan song for my time on the commission and I am very proud of it.  There are now researchers who will be of considerable help and value to Members of these Houses.  In the short time the service has been available, I have made use of it on a number of occasions and the people involved are excellent, as is the service they provide.  I recommend it to those Members who have not used it yet.</P>
        <P>We also provided additional staff for Members of the Houses, with each Member getting a second worker who could act as a PA or researcher, etc.  That has worked well for <Col N="1271"/>Members and is evident in how they are doing their work.  The commission displayed flexibility, tailoring Members&rsquo; needs and space so they could fit their staff into what was available.  The Deloitte report was also important to the commission and made recommendations on which we followed up.</P>
        <P>We encountered a difficulty in the past year and a half that has exercised our minds at regular intervals since.  In the past 48 hours I have seen some members of the commission around a table on six occasions as we tried to cobble this Bill together.  In that context it is important to note what has been agreed.  An amendment is being inserted into the Bill tonight and it is important for future commissions that we state what we are agreeing so that a future Ceann Comhairle and commissioners will not find themselves in difficulty when trying to provide money to fund a service.</P>
        <P>This difficulty originated in mid-2005 when the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs asked the commission to assume responsibility for translation services for Bills that would come before the House.  Traditionally there was a translation section, Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, within the Houses that provided an excellent in-house translation service.  As a result of the introduction of new legislation that would place a huge burden on everyone in terms of translation, a home had to be found for this service.  The Minister suggested the commission should be the home for this facility but we had difficulty with that idea because it was not within our initial remit and we did not have any competence in the area because the translation section already operated, although it was doing a different, restricted job.</P>
        <P>When push came to shove, letters were exchanged and meetings took place to clarify the situation and our responsibilities.  There has been such an increase in demand for translation work that people who are competent in translating into the first official language can now offer their services at a premium.  Anyone competent enough to do this who sets up a company offering translation services would do extremely well in a short time.  I was told today that translation is worth 35 cent per word.  I volunteered my services, saying I would do the easy words and would let someone else do the hard ones.</P>
        <P>We entered into correspondence with the Minister to clarify the situation.  On 6 November 2006, the Minister wrote to the Ceann Comhairle to say he had consulted with the Minister for Finance and, subsequently, brought the issue before the Government.  He made it clear at the outset on the Government&rsquo;s behalf that provision of additional resources, if required, would not be an issue.  He assured us on behalf of the Government that the necessary funding for translation services, including staff and other costs, would be provided during the next funding period.  That <Col N="1272"/>was a direct commitment that we would be provided with the additional funds necessary.</P>
        <P>Previously, on 27 February we received a letter from the Minister stating he had made it clear on the Government&rsquo;s behalf that provision of additional resources if required was not an issue.  He further wrote that we would be aware of the Department of Finance&rsquo;s commitment prior to the establishment of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which is resourced on a three-year cycle, to respond constructively and immediately to any proposals for additional translation staff following such a review and this remained the Government&rsquo;s position.  This was a further commitment that there would be funding for a translation service.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We also received an earlier letter on 25 September 2005.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs stated &ldquo;The Government is of the considered view &mdash; as was recommended in the report &mdash; that the existing arrangements, whereby Irish translations of Acts of the Oireachtas are prepared by Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in...should continue. . . I am authorised in the context to say that we as Government note that proposals that may emerge from such a review&rdquo; .</P>
        <P>A minute of a commission meeting on Wednesday, 21 June 2006 reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;The Commission had before it a note on discussions at official level to the effect that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has indicated that it would be prepared to:</P>
        <P LI="2">(1) provide a guarantee in writing to meet whatever funding is required to cater for the additional burden imposed by the Official Languages Act.  This funding can be explicitly ringfenced in the next Commission Bill&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Therein lies the nub of our difficulty.  It was very disingenuous of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs not to mention ring-fencing when the Bill was published.  It was stated the commission was explicitly given the responsibility and the implicit direction to provide translations, which is not the case.  The Oireachtas commission exists to run the Houses and provide services for Members.  Providing translations is a secondary service, which the commission is happy to provide and it is prepared to live with the commitment it subsequently received.  However, it was disingenuous of the Minister to make such a commitment without following through on it.</P>
        <P>It is crucially important that the final correspondence on this issue be placed on the record.  I thank the Minister for Finance and, in particular, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is also a member of the commission, for his hard work over the past two weeks, especially over the past 48 hours, to resolve this matter.  Arising from the toing and <Col N="1273"/>froing in which the Minister of State was engaged, a letter dated 7 December 2006 was sent by the Minister for Finance to the Ceann Comhairle and chairman of the commission, which states:</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P LI="1">While I appreciate your and the Commission&rsquo;s concern, I think we are all agreed that the &euro;11m approx. amount for translation included in the &euro;393m allocation is a generous one . . .</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">However, I am happy, in any event, to give you and the Commission my assurance as Minister for Finance that if the &euro;393m allocation does over time look likely to be exceeded because of higher translation costs, then I will of course be willing to address the matter.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">That outlines the way forward.</P>
        <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is also very important in running the House.  The committee met on numerous occasions and commission members were on a sub-committee of the CPP.  We sat through many meetings to bring forward proposals on what needed to be done during dissolution periods.  We presented a report to the House which was accepted unanimously by Members and referred to the Attorney General.  Over the past number of weeks and, in particular, over the past 48 hours, the sub-committee addressed an issue which had to be resolved to implement this report.  The Minister of State did a good job in securing agreement for an amendment that will be made to the Bill later and I commend him on that.</P>
        <P>The commission is delighted to welcome the Bill and the amendments that will be made later will result in very good legislation, which will provide for the running of the commission over the next three years.  We are happy with the allocation of funds and the additional commitment made, allowing us to proceed with our work and provide services over the coming period.  It will fall to others, rather than myself, to see that through but I am happy to have been associated with the commission over the past three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also happy to contribute to the debate on this important Bill, which is a milestone, as it represents a stocktaking following the exploratory period of one of the most innovative initiatives of the Oireachtas in the management of its own affairs in the past three years.  For many years, a number of us sought to establish independence for the Oireachtas from the heavy hand of the Department of Finance and to establish the proper status of our national Parliament as independent master of its own destiny so that it could disburse its own funding as it saw fit to serve Members and develop a modern efficient Parliament comparable to the best in the world.  Every Member has had the privilege of witnessing how the best Parliaments work worldwide and viewing <Col N="1274"/>the IT and research facilities and support staff available to ensure proper accountability.</P>
        <P>The House has two functions &mdash; to generate law and, equally important, to hold the Executive to account.  Too often in the past Executives, including those of which I was a member, have viewed the Oireachtas as merely a rubber stamp for legislation and policy determined by Government.  The committee system provides for the monitoring of each Department and it was important that the constitutional responsibility on us to hold the Executive to account should have been implemented efficiently.  That could not be done on a shoestring and, therefore, resources were made available to augment the parliamentary staff.  The commission has made a remarkable start in the three years of its existence to improve the library and research facilities.  They have not been fully explored by all Members but extraordinary work has been undertaken by the current commission.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the Ceann Comhairle who, as chairman of the commission, has steered this innovative new development over the past three years.  I also pay tribute to my fellow members who, by and large, set aside party political considerations and worked in the interests of developing an effective Oireachtas, which is extremely important.  I would also like to make favourable mention of the role of the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s representative on the commission.  We were very fortunate that the Minister chose Deputy Brian Lenihan as his representative because his contribution as chairman of the finance sub-committee of the commission and his general input have been of a sterling order and he has maintained the primacy of the role of Parliament, on which we need to expand further.  The initial grounding legislation could have gone further and, in truth, I would have liked this legislation to have gone further also.  Prising open the fingers of the Department of Finance is a slow process, as officials here know, and it takes more than one attempt to succeed.  We have now tried twice so perhaps at the third attempt, in three years&rsquo; time, we may go further and gain a greater degree of independence.  In this way the notional sanctioning by the Minister for posts and salary levels and the importance of the flexibility of the commission in regulating affairs in the interests of Members and the people will be better understood.</P>
        <P>I welcome an tAire, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to the Chamber and I am sure he takes an interest in the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and was not drawn here by the comments of my friend and colleague, the Fine Gael Party spokesperson.</P>
        <P>Of the myriad of issues that presented themselves to the commission, the translation service was one of the few discordant issues.  I had the privilege of being a member of the sub-committee <Col N="1275"/>that met the Minister and we were given firm commitments on the ring fencing of money.  I agree with the sequencing presented by Deputy Paul McGrath and I understood there would be a ring-fenced subhead for additional costs incurred due to translation services.  It is proper that translation be undertaken, but in the interest of transparency I understood, along the members and officials of the commission, that it would be a separate subhead.  It has instead been subsumed into the commission&rsquo;s general running.</P>
        <P>A letter of comfort was read into the record by Deputy Paul McGrath which states that, should the translation demand be greater than what was provided for, additional funding would be provided.  I hope that when the issue of the funding package is addressed again in three years that commitment will have been met through a transparent, separate subhead, reimbursable on the basis of demand rather than subsumed into a general subhead.</P>
        <P>Members of the commission, across all parties, seek the removal of translation services from the explicit core functions of the commission to its general functions.  We have tabled an amendment in this regard, to which the names of commission members have been added.  The commission has many important functions but its core functions are to provide for the running of the Houses of the Oireachtas and to have charge of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There are many other important functions, one of which is translation services.  This issue represented an unfortunate interaction and was one of the few discordant episodes of the past three years.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is correct that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has received a generous allocation for the next three years.  Who knows what will arise?  There may be a very large redundancy bill to be paid, depending on the expression of the love of the people in May, as my friend and colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, says.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That Bill may apply on both sides.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It may apply all over the place.  Deputy Cassidy&rsquo;s is one of the few safe seats in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>He certainly has the ear of the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>None of us can guarantee our security regarding the forthcoming election.</P>
        <P>People may believe the commission has been overly generous to itself so I would like to make some points in that regard.  The &euro;393 million provided for is to allow this House do play its constitutional role as watchdog, holding the Govern<Col N="1276"/>ment to account.  In real terms that figure will represent 0.23% of overall Government expenditure next year and the Houses of the Oireachtas does more than hold the Government to account; it also generates legislation.  To put it in context, less than a quarter of 1% of expenditure is assigned to us.  In percentage terms this compares favourably to parliaments anywhere one cares to look.</P>
        <P>We must be more forceful in the job we do and less apologetic about spending public money.  Those of us privileged to examine developing companies, as I have, understand that creating stable accounting mechanisms is one of the most crucial factors, along with a proper, functioning public accounts system and Comptroller and Auditor General system and the holding to account of Departments.  Officials in every Department regard our public accounts system as a real measure of accountability and it is important not only that it continues to be effective, but that it is augmented in its effectiveness.</P>
        <P>In terms of financial management generally, the commission&rsquo;s success has helped bring about developments such as the new research, Library and support facilities augmenting the committee system.  This has been done prudently, because the committee did not squander the money it received in the first allocation three years ago.  It could have front loaded the expenditure and gone back to the Minister for Finance seeking more funding but it did not.  In fact the commission came in under budget in its three years showing it to be a prudent manager of resources properly voted to it by this House.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General of the Oireachtas is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, a development I welcome, and I look forward to his first presentation before the commission early next year.</P>
        <P>Members of the commission have had a unique insight into the workings of support staff here.  Those of us privileged to work on the commission have seen how effective and efficient civil servants of all grades provide support in these buildings.  Those of us who have dealt with the Bills Office and the other offices in the House know the remarkable work done there.  I do not know how they work through the night on complicated legislation aggregating and grouping amendments, but they do so in a wonderful way.</P>
        <P>If the commission is to be independent it must have a modern system of administration.  I hope a parliamentary services Bill will come before the next D&aacute;il to examine the legal structure for administration, as has been done in developed parliaments such as Australia&rsquo;s.  An Act from 1959 governs the administrative structure here and this needs to be updated.  Could the progressive Minister of State in charge of the Bill signal that a parliamentary services Bill is something he could consider in a future administration?</P><Col N="1277"/>
        <P>I support the amendment that is a manifestation of the will of the House expressed nearly a year ago in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges sub-committee report that was adopted unanimously.  I hope the formula we have arrived at on a cross party basis will serve the House, the Members and the interests of democracy.  I hope this Bill passes quickly tonight and I compliment all involved in the first term of office of the commission which was exploratory and ground breaking.  I hope the next phase of the commission, whomsoever its membership comprises of, will be ever more successful in developing a strong role scrutinising our Parliament, holding the Executive to account and serving the people even better than the Oireachtas has to date.</P>

	<P>I welcomed the establishment of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, have been supportive of its evolution and encourage its further progression.  Such a body is necessary if the Oireachtas is to fully run its own affairs and exercise its constitutional remit of subjecting Government policies to proper analysis.  I congratulate the commission on successfully fulfilling that remit during its short existence.  However, I continue to hold the reservations I expressed when the principal Act was being debated with <Col N="1279"/>regard to the composition of the commission.  Even though the Bill before us clearly provides that members of the commission serve in a personal capacity rather than representing their parties, it is true that the make-up of the present commission reflects the way in which particular groups are represented in both Houses.</P>
        <P>Such a state of affairs has meant a lack of success for up to 25 Deputies.  Standing Order 114, which has been changed on a number of occasions, most notably in the early 1980s, recognises groups of seven or more Members as being fully fledged political parties.  Standing Orders also recognise political parties and their leaders for matters such as votes of sympathy, although I accept that changing Standing Orders is a different debate.  As a result of these Standing Orders, my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Joe Higgins as representative of the Socialist Party and other Independent Deputies who are not members of the Technical Group do not have a direct voice on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which is unfortunate.  I acknowledge that many of the members of the commission go out of their way to inform and consult, but I seek mechanisms which would improve that process.</P>
        <P>If the commission is to serve future D&aacute;la&iacute;, it will have to take into account the political changes that have occured in this country and give broader recognition to how the Houses run their affairs.  Ireland&rsquo;s political transformation is likely to be permanent in view of our increasing adoption of a European model of politics which involves a multiplicity of parties.  To that end, I propose an amendment which would provide for an additional member to the commission.  A similar amendment was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle on grounds of cost when I tried to introduce it to the principle Act.  I thought that decision was a strict interpretation of Standing Orders so I decided to try again by suggesting the appointment of a floating member of the commission which would alternate over a two and a half year period and would be shared between the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Such a member could better represent the interests of both Houses on the commission.</P>
        <P>I accept that my amendment may be flawed but I hope that, by raising the issue and making Deputies aware of an inconsistency in terms of the commission&rsquo;s operations, consideration is given to the matter in the future.  Deputy Howlin has pointed out that the legislation will be revisited in three years&rsquo; time, at which point the remaining fingers of the Department of Finance may be pried away by whatever Government is then in power.</P>

        <P>I am generally supportive of the amendments which have been tabled by the members of the commission.  The amendments represent a sincere attempt on their part to address some of the outstanding issues which need to be brought into focus.  This Bill provides an opportunity to do that and my party and I will support the amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2006 and related issues.  I thank the members of the commission, many of whom have made a valuable contribution, for their work.  The commission is a classic example of public service at its best, which is something we appreciate and should support.  I share some of Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s concerns, which I will comment on later.  Major issues and responsibilities are at stake in this legislation.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has 11 members, ten of whom are Members of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  The Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad are on the commission.  One member of the commission is appointed by the Minister for Finance.  Four members of the commission are from the D&aacute;il and three are from the Seanad.  They are appointed by the ordinary Members of each House.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure that the members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission are representative of the composition of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I support the general thrust of the Bill and I commend the work of the commission.  I accept the points which were made by Deputy Boyle about this issue.  Deputies from the major groups in this House should wake up to the reality that the Technical Group in the D&aacute;il represents between 21% and 22% of the voting public, according to figures from recent opinion polls.  We have to accept the reality that such people have a right to be represented in all facets of public life.  It is important for the larger parties to deal with this issue head-on by accepting their responsibilities.  If one is interested in democracy, one should ensure that the voices of Deputies who represent between 21% and 22% of the public are heard strongly.</P>
        <P>It has been proposed that &euro;393 million be allocated to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for the 2007-09 period.  The Minister of State mentioned earlier that this figure has been agreed with the commission.  I welcome the proposed allocation because it represents excellent value for the taxpayer, as the Minister of State said.  Value for money is something of which we should always be conscious.  It is all very well to say that the &euro;393 million in question is excellent value &mdash; I agree &mdash; but that does not mean we should not be constantly vigilant when taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent.  The issue of accountability <Col N="1281"/>was raised again recently.  When we talk about democracy, it is important that we also talk about accountability, which is lacking in many areas of public life and society in general.</P>
        <P>This legislation provides that the responsibilities of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission include paying the salaries and allowances of Deputies and Senators and paying the salaries of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  While we should be open-minded about such matters, we should also ensure that there is accountability in this regard.  It is not acceptable for public money to be squandered by other Departments, which is something that arises in other debates in this House.  An investigation can be demanded when the principal of small and disadvantaged inner city school finds that the school&rsquo;s budget has been exceeded by &euro;200 or &euro;300.  The reality is that Members of the Oireachtas have a duty to be accountable and to ensure that public funds are not wasted.  When we are talking about public money, we should think about matters like the Dublin Port tunnel, which is the subject of a great deal of hype at present because it is due to open next week.  The tunnel ran &euro;250 million over its budget.  Many roads projects have run up to 86% over budget.  Such over-runs should be challenged because they involve taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not talking about the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission &mdash; I am talking about the Departments.  The Minister for Transport, for example, has exceeded his budget for certain projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought we were talking about the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about value for money and accountability.  I have pointed out that some Departments and Ministers are not accepting their public responsibility.  I am not referring to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission at all.  If Deputy McGrath had been listening to me, he would know that I commended the commission and pointed out that issues like respect for democracy are important.  We need to ensure that this money is spent wisely.  We accept that it is important to bed down the principles of public service, accountability and respect for democracy.  I welcome Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s amendment, in which he proposes the insertion of a new section 5 in the Bill.  I will support that amendment strongly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to declare an interest at the outset &mdash; I am a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="1282"/>Commission (Amendment) Bill 2006.  I hope it will have a speedy passage.  The Bill makes provision for the running of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  It is important for Ireland, as a democracy, to have an Oireachtas which is transparent and adequately funded.  I welcome the &euro;393 million that has been approved by the Minister for Finance for the running of the Houses of the Oireachtas until the end of 2009.  I commend the Minister on his support for the work of the commission.</P>
        <P>The unanimous view of the members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission was that the translation services were creating a difficulty for us.  We learned that savings needed to be made in other areas because the costs of the translation service were eating into our budget.  During my time on the commission, I have found that decisions are reached by consensus, in the main.  It would be a pity if we were unable to stay within our budget as a result of financial constraints which we did not bring on ourselves.  I hope the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s commitment, which was mentioned by Deputy Finian McGrath, will be honoured.  I do not doubt that it will be honoured.</P>
        <P>It is important to remind ourselves that the commission has produced two annual reports to date, for 2004 and 2005.  It has produced two sets of annual accounts, for the same years.  It has published a strategic plan for 2005-06 and a further plan for 2007-09 will follow.  The commission has produced four annual Estimates and 11 statutory instruments.  The commission has done some work to enhance the background facilities for members.  Research services have been improved, for example.  Many Members are unaware of the significantly enhanced and improved services in the Oireachtas Library.  Given that we are approaching a general election, it seems likely that the Members of the next D&aacute;il will feel the full benefit of the work that has been done.</P>
        <P>The facilities of the House have been substantially improved by the commission.  The opening hours of Leinster House have been extended and the Oireachtas cr&egrave;che and fitness room have been opened.  While such relatively new facilities have been developed in a low-key manner, they are in place.  We are slowly but firmly getting to a stage at which we can hold our own with other parliaments in more advanced and longer established democracies.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill, as I said.  It will transfer some of the liabilities from the Minister for Finance to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission in respect of the staff of the commission, which is to be welcomed.  I acknowledge and commend the members of the commission for their work.  I am a relatively new member of the commission &mdash; I am probably its newest member.  I could see from the outset of my membership of the commission <Col N="1283"/>that there was a genuine determination on the part of all the representatives of the political parties to work together, where possible.  I am aware of only one occasion on which there was a division and it was of a relatively minor nature.  The Independent Deputies who are not represented, including the Green Party Members, can rest assured their views are being taken into account by the membership of the commission.  This is positive legislation and I hope it has a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to compliment the Ceann Comhairle and the commission.  The Government might learn from the commission in that when it gets a budget it could come in under budget.  I thank the commission members for the excellent job they have done on behalf of the elected representatives because sometimes in this House we are afraid to represent ourselves.  Civil servants and Ministers are good at doing that but we often forget about the Members.  For many years in this House we were left behind and we were afraid of the media.  I say to the members of the media &mdash; there are not many of them here &mdash; that their needs are met in this Bill because the facilities they use in this House come out of the costs of running the Houses.</P>
        <P>I welcome the call for more members on the commission.  I do not mind who becomes a member.  I thought the Independent Members were represented.  Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole is an Independent Member and an excellent representative.  I have worked with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, not as a member of the commission but on the Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests and a more able or excellent representative one could not meet.  I am not an Independent Member but I would not object to him representing me as an Oireachtas Member because he is a very able man.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not an Independent either, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not talking about Deputy Boyle.  I am talking about the people who want to be elected to this House as Independent Members and the minute they get in here they <Col N="1284"/>want to form parties and have the same rules, regulations and positions as political parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I am talking about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>And individual researchers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  They do not mind taking the &euro;34,000 even though they are in the Technical Group, as they call it, but they still want to be Independents.</P>
        <P>The chief executive, Mr. Coughlan, and the staff of this House are excellent.  Every member of staff in this House is courteous and helpful and does an excellent job in a quiet and nice way.  The staff are helpful and do the best they can for the Members.  I compliment Mr. Coughlan and every member of his staff from the ushers to every worker in this House, including the cleaners who are here bright and early in the morning.  They do a good job on behalf of this House and they should be complimented on that.  They are pleasant people who work very hard and if the commission has any role in that area, I hope it will ensure they are paid very well because they are entitled to that.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the provision for translation services but I do not want to see Ministers avail of the services of the commission.  They have their own budgets, offices and facilities.  If one Minister succeeds in availing of commission services, all the other Ministers will do it.  I am glad the Minister for Finance will ring-fence the money.  I welcome the translation provision but Departments should not get involved in the work of the commission as the commission was set up to look after Members&rsquo; interests only.  We should not be afraid to look after Members&rsquo; interests.  Everybody else can look after their own interests.</P>
        <P>The commission has been run very well.  Deputy Paul McGrath, who is the Fine Gael representative along with Senator Ulick Burke, Deputy Howlin and the other people involved, have done an excellent job.  It takes a lot of time and there is a good deal of work involved.  When I represented Members before the commission was established we had many problems to deal with.  I am glad the commission members have resolved many of those problems.  They have looked after the best interests of Members.  They should never be afraid to do that.  The Executive has a job to do.</P>
        <P>We are the elected Members, not the selected Members.  We have enough of that in respect of what is happening in county councils.  We have the selected county managers and the elected representatives.  The power is being taken away from elected members.  We must not let that happen in this House.  At least we have this commission.  We can run our own business and make our own decisions.  I do not want any Ministers or Depart<Col N="1285"/>ments infringing on that.  I want the commission to remain independent and look after the interests of this House.  If it does that as well as it has done it in the past few years, there will be no problems.  Some of the senior Ministers should examine the way it has run its business.  It came in under budget and did an excellent job on behalf of the Members.  I do not have any vested interest other than the fact that I am a Member of this House.</P>
        <P>I thank the members of the commission who have done an excellent job.  I publicly thank the chief executive, Mr. Coughlan, and his staff who do an excellent job in a courteous way.  We may not be as courteous to them as we should be but they do the job well and I compliment them for that.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill because it proves that the elected representatives are well able to run the business of the Houses.  I know the Minister for Finance and his officials do not want to let any power go but that is something the Civil Service will have to learn.  They want more power; they want to control the budgets, the Members and everything else.  I am delighted we are taking away that control from them because they have enough to do.  We do not want them to be concerned about our interests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We will worry about them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us have the sleepless nights.  All we want them to do is make sure that the necessary money is put in place and we will spend it wisely.  They do their job well but they should let us run our business.  They have enough to do.  We are trying to relieve them of work and they should not get excited about that.  We are doing the best we can.</P>
        <P>I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the people involved in the commission.  They do a very important job.  We should not be afraid of the media or the general public.  Once everything is above board and we can show the people what we are doing with the money and how it is being spent, we have nothing to worry about.  Members should never be afraid to look after their interests.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who will avail of the first five minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and the explicit provision for translation services.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify some issues.  First, it is the Constitution that requires translation of Acts and the only way of doing away with that requirement is to change the Constitution.  Second, since the foundation of the State, prior to the Constitution responsibility for the translation of Acts traditionally rested with the House.  Third, until <Col N="1286"/>now, it has also been part of Standing Orders that the Acts would be translated.</P>
        <P>The issue was brought forward because somebody took a case to the Supreme Court and a judgment was given by, among others, Mr. Justice Hardiman.  We found ourselves in a situation where there was clearly a risk that the State, as a totality, not only had to deal with the current translation requirements but also with the arrears.  In fact, contrary to popular belief and myth, the Official Languages Act, by invoking Article 8(2) of the Constitution, gave us a framework in which we bought considerable time.  In other words, by having a clear framework in which we would deal with this issue, we fire-proofed ourselves against a constitutional case in regard to the fact that the Oireachtas or the State had not fulfilled its constitutional duties to translate the Acts.  It is important that fact be understood.</P>
        <P>When we brought in the Act all sections became operable after a period of three years.  The three years passed but unfortunately not as much preparatory work as I would have liked was done in those three years.  Those issues are now behind us.</P>
        <P>I understand the record of a minute provided by the commission has been read into the record.  It is a minute of a meeting of 21 June with officials of my Department.  Unfortunately, those officials are not in a position to defend themselves and their reputations in this House.</P>

	<P>I would like to make it absolutely clear that anything my officials said at that meeting would have been subject to further discussions with the Department of Finance because they were not in a position to do otherwise.  I know the officials involved and they would never have given undertakings unless they had been pre-checked.

Therefore, I am sure, as is stated, that they gave indications but no undertakings were given.  That is the issue that must be stressed &mdash; they indicated that these issues could be examined and decisions arrived at.  The minute states that they indicated these matters, not that they gave an undertaking.  I want to stress that word.  I stand by the minute and stress that an indication was given that these things were possible but that an explicit undertaken was not given.  It is absolutely important that the minute, as it is written, is placed in its proper context so we all understand that in these discussions indications were given but undertakings could not have been given without having consulted further with the Department of Finance, which was the lead Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The needs of the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas have been enhanced and fulfilled by the appointment of this commission, which was a great decision.  I pay tribute to everyone from the Ceann Comhairle who has chaired it to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Deputies McGrath and Howlin and Senator O&rsquo;Toole, colleagues with whom I have worked on other committees and sub-committees of these Houses.  The people have been well served by those Members in terms of their expertise, experience, determination and will to do the right thing in the national interest.</P>
        <P>When I was elected to the Seanad in 1982 I shared an office with five Members.  We had two telephones and had to book a time to use the telephone.  We had one secretary.  A big change had to be made.  Lobby groups were coming in here with all the tools of their trade and we were left powerless in terms of what we had to contend with and had to try to match.  The facilities we now have are a step in the right direction.  However, a number of facilities are still required ranging from one as simple as a colour photocopier, which no Member has.  We are living in a technological age and must compete with all the facilities and services available to lobby groups in particular.  It is not good enough for Members of Parliament to only match those facilities.  Whatever tools of the trade that Oireachtas Members need should be provided by the commission immediately.</P>
        <P>I welcome the allocation of money for the work being done by Oireachtas Members.  I compliment Mr. Kieran Coughlan, Clerk of the D&aacute;il, and Ms Deirdre Lane, Clerk of the Seanad.  They are wonderful people as are their staff who work hard to serve Oireachtas Members.  I fully support our having a translation service and it being funded.  I support the Members tooth and nail.  Whatever they have done up to now, the job has only started and Oireachtas Members are a long way from getting the tools of their trade, which we still require.  If the difficulty is a lack of funding, irrespective of how it is to be provided, the Government has shown that a serious will and attitude, which is the most important element, exist to supply services for each Member of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.</P>
        <P>The last appointments which were made to provide us with parliamentary assistants were a Godsend.  The volume of work that a Member does today is at least five times what I did when I was first elected many years ago.  At that time a constituent would call to one at the weekend, one would write to him or her and to the Minister responsible, the Minister would reply in the second week and the problem would be dealt with in the third week.  However, today one is contacted about a problem in the morning by mobile call or by e-mail, which arrives even before one opens one&rsquo;s eyes.  A constituent will <Col N="1289"/>telephone at 5 p.m. on the same day and ask how one got on in addressing the issue.  If one is not on the other end of the phone and is in the Chamber or doing other Oireachtas work, one will get a text worded to the effect &ldquo;Please let me know. P.S. I expect an answer&rdquo;.  That is what is happening and Members do not have access to a facility as simple as a colour photocopier.  We need an enormous number of facilities.</P>
        <P>I am chairman of the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which is an honour and a privilege.  I was working with colleagues, relatively new Members such as Deputy Boyle, who when they came here from the private sector, where they had access to all the tools of the trade, could not believe that Parliament did not have the bare essentials to carry the work at this time when money is flowing because of good Government policy, good civil servants and good Members of Parliament on all sides who tease out issues with transparency the order of the day.</P>
        <P>I am probably the longest serving Member having regard to the time I spent in both Houses, along with the Acting Chairman.  What we are doing here is only halfway along the route.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for his work in this respect.  I have always been an big admirer of his ability and his determination to help and do the right thing at the right time.  Thankfully, this Bill is progressing and I hope the next Parliament will take it a stage further where we will be able to fight with both hands out in front and not with one tied behind our backs as most of us have done while we served in whichever House we were lucky to be Members of.</P>

	<P>I am glad there was a broad welcome for this Bill from all sides of the House and of this very constructive debate.  I am also grateful for the kind comments made by a number of Members about myself.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the members of the commission specifically for the work they have done in the past few weeks leading up to the presentation of this legislation in the House.  Three specific concerns were raised by members of the commission and I am glad to say, subject to what we will be discussing on Committee Stage shortly, that I believe all those concerns will be addressed.</P>
        <P>I join in the many tributes paid by Deputies to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and to his staff.  The Clerk is the chief executive of the commission as well.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I will deal with the specific points raised by Deputies.  Deputy Paul McGrath outlined the work of the commission and I was glad to note he found the commission&rsquo;s work was popular with Members.  Deputy Paul McGrath decided to explore the history of the relationship between the commission and the Minister on the provision of translation services.  There is no doubt that Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in always provided the translations of the Acts of the Oireachtas, but decisions of the courts in recent years and the Official Languages Act 2003 require the production of contemporaneous translation.  That is a more onerous obligation than the obligation hitherto imposed on the translation service.  The practical issue was addressed in a letter of comfort which was read into the record by Deputy McGrath.  I noted that he was satisfied with the assurance given by the Minister for Finance in that respect.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Deputy Howlin highlighted the importance of the commission in securing the independence of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I was glad that Deputy Howlin referred to the two functions, which do not pertain to both Houses.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann is a legislative Chamber, but D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is the body to which the Government is responsible, as well as being a legislative body.  In public discussion about the work of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, this point is not stressed often enough.  Public opinion suggests that the D&aacute;il is simply a Legislature and that our job is to work as legislators.  However, it is also the job of the Opposition Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to hold the Executive to account.  I do not think that fact is sufficiently mentioned in public debate.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the costings given by Deputy Howlin and the fact that they compared favourably with other parliaments.  I agree with him that the complex legislation on parliamentary services should be consolidated and modernised.  I know the committee has looked at this matter in its deliberations.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh was dissatisfied with the representation of smaller parties on the commission, as was Deputy Boyle, who will be raising the issue on Committee Stage this evening.  There is a problem here because apart from the Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Ceann Comhairle and the nominee of the Minister for Finance, there are seven vacancies left.  The only way to address the problem is to have a larger number of members on the commission.  However, the commission has always seen itself as an independent body, rather like the board of directors of a company, a body that makes its own determinations about what is in the best interests of the Oireachtas.  There is an issue of size in any body of that type.  If the size is enlarged too much, the efficiency of the board is weakened.  An attempt was made to secure balance and this will <Col N="1291"/>be examined in light of the results of the general election next year.  A fresh dispensation will be required and an effort will be made to accommodate the representatives of all the parties.  As a member of the commission, I found that the interests of all of the parties were safeguarded by the various members of the commission.  There was an awareness among all the members that conflicting interests and positions existed, but that they would have to stand apart from that and make an overall judgment on the best interest of the Houses.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh also expressed dissatisfaction with the facilities available for broadcasting and for meetings by smaller parties.  One of the most satisfactory aspects of the commission is the high degree of co-operation extended to it by the Office of Public Works.  The OPW has treated the commission as it would treat a line Department in the Government.  The OPW has always been anxious to facilitate our wishes in every possible respect.  The matters raised by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh should be raised, through the commission, with the OPW.</P>
        <P>Deputy Boyle touched on the difficulty of securing adequate representation for the different interests, but he was very supportive of the commission&rsquo;s work, for which I thank him.  Deputy Paul McGrath stressed the importance of obtaining value for money and the commission is very conscious of this.  We are conscious to procure value for money in any decision we make.  Deputy Nolan spoke about the extended opening hours of the Library and listed many of the commission&rsquo;s achievements.  He made the point that the commission members had shown a genuine determination to work together.  I agree with that.  I can recall only one occasion where we had a vote along party lines.  The one lesson to be drawn from that episode was that the leaders of the parties should never get involved in the business of the commission.  If that rule is followed by party leaders, we will not have any difficulty.  They should not view the representatives on the commission from their own party uniquely as representatives of their political interest.  The Bill does not envisage this and all members of the commission were very conscious of their independent obligations.  At all stages they were faithful to those obligations.  It is a difficulty and this commission has set a good example for the future on this issue.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ring thanked the commission for its work and paid a generous tribute to the staff of the Houses.  He opined that the Minister for Finance must be very sad that he no longer controls the budget allocation for the Houses, but my experience has been to the contrary.  The present Minister for Finance and his predecessor, who in many ways was the architect of this Bill, were very glad to be disembarrassed of the obligation <Col N="1292"/>of providing direct administration for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, recalled the legal history of the obligation to translate the Bills, while Deputy Cassidy stressed the importance of improving the facilities of the House at all stages.</P>
        <P>This has been a very constructive debate.  I wish to thank Members for their contributions.  The commission can look back on the last three years as a period in which the commission has got off to a good start.  There has been a solid list of achievements.  &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;, was a phrase used around the time of the last election, but it can be applied with equal justice to the work of the commission.</P>

        <P>There is one small part of a letter that further enhances and endorses what I said earlier, which I wish to add to the discussion about the amendment.

      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue in the House.  A number of years ago, the then Southern Health Board approved in principle the phased closure of St. Finan&rsquo;s psychiatric hospital, Killarney.  The lands at St. Finan&rsquo;s Hospital, which are currently owned by the Health Service Executive are undoubtedly one of Killarney&rsquo;s best public assets.  As I stated many times, when the hospital eventually closes it will be essential to retain this public asset for the public good and to keep it in public ownership.</P>
        <P>A statement issued by the Taoiseach in December 2003 committed the Government to exploring the potential to use State-owned lands for housing purposes.  The 55 acres at St. Finan&rsquo;s Hospital, Killarney, represent a prime opportunity for the Government to deliver on that commitment and it would be an extremely suitable site for local authority and social and affordable housing.  As there are up to 500 households on Killarney&rsquo;s housing list at present, there is every need for a substantial housing programme to be put in place and the site at St. Finan&rsquo;s Hospital is a prime location.</P>
        <P>Killarney&rsquo;s town clerk has stated that the lands at St. Finan&rsquo;s are ideal for housing.  Killarney Town Council seeks 30 acres of the aforementioned lands for housing and facilities for community and voluntary organisations.  Recently, a group called the St. Finan&rsquo;s Community Action Group made a number of positive suggestions regarding the use of the lands on the closure of the hospital.  In addition to housing, a number of other organisations could benefit from the site.  For example, for many years the south Kerry branch of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland has been seeking a suitable unit from the HSE for those with multiple sclerosis.  This group has recently joined the Irish Wheelchair Association, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and Kerry Care to campaign for a unit that would house their organisations and allow <Col N="1296"/>them to carry out their work in suitable premises.  The Killarney rugby and judo clubs are also in need of a site and facilities for their members.  The local branch of the Order of Malta is applying to the HSE for sufficient lands to allow them to house three ambulances and to provide training facilities for their staff members.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should note that a wide range of community and voluntary groups, in addition to Killarney Town Council, are in need of central sites and it seems logical to utilise fully a prime location like the lands at St. Finan&rsquo;s when they become available.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with proposals for a health care centre on the site.  While the HSE plans for the site will focus primarily on the provision of health services in the area, I firmly believe that consideration must also be given to a number of other possibilities for the site.  I fully support the call from the St. Finan&rsquo;s Community Action Group that these lands should be retained for the use of social and affordable housing, as well as for community, voluntary and sporting organisations.</P>
        <P>On the wider issue of State lands and health services, Members are aware the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Progressive Democrats are hell bent on privatising the health services and selling State assets as speedily as possible, without thought on the consequences.  I am certain they would not think twice about selling the lands at St. Finan&rsquo;s.  This must not be allowed to happen.  As previously stated, up to 500 households in Killarney are on the housing list, not to mention a wide range of community and voluntary organisations that are in need of facilities.  This prime opportunity must not be allowed to pass.  The Labour Party will campaign actively to ensure the site, which has an emotional attachment for many people in Killarney, will be put to the best use when the hospital is closed, to the benefit of all the people in Killarney.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for raising this matter on this evening&rsquo;s Adjournment.</P>
        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services is assigned to the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004.  The HSE has informed my Department that St. Finan&rsquo;s Hospital campus, to which the Deputy referred, measures approximately 55 acres in total, with approximately 43 acres sited to the south of the ring road in Killarney and the remainder to its north.</P>
        <P>At present, mental health services are provided from accommodation within the St. Finan&rsquo;s Hospital building.  It is planned to transfer these services to new purpose-built accommodation over the next two years.  The HSE&rsquo;s plans for the <Col N="1297"/>campus are to develop a range of health care facilities on the campus to provide modern accommodation to meet the present and future health needs of the population of Killarney and its surrounding areas.  The plans include the development of a primary care centre and headquarters for HSE services provided to the population of Killarney and east Kerry.</P>
        <P>The St. Finan&rsquo;s building itself, and some curtilage, that is, an area of land to make the building saleable, has been identified as surplus to requirements and will be disposed of when the building has been vacated.  The HSE has advised that no actual date has been set for the sale of St Finan&rsquo;s building at this time.  The HSE is in discussions with the local authority concerning the possibility of disposing of some of the site to facilitate affordable housing.</P>
        <P>The report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, which was launched in January this year, outlines an exciting vision of the future for mental health services in Ireland and sets out a framework for action to achieve it in the next seven to ten years.  The expert group found:</P>
        <P LI="1">Mental hospitals have been the mainstay of mental health services in Ireland for many years.  However, the type of person-centred, recovery-oriented care recommended ... cannot be provided in institutions of this size or environment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On that basis, the group recommended that steps should be taken to bring about the closure of all the remaining psychiatric hospitals which are a legacy of a bygone age and to reinvest the resources released by these closures in the mental health services.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the closure of the large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication in 1984 of the policy document, Planning for the Future.  A number of the large psychiatric hospitals around the country have already been closed, including Our Lady&rsquo;s, Cork, St. Patrick&rsquo;s, Castlerea, St. Columba&rsquo;s, Sligo, St. Mary&rsquo;s, Castlebar, and Our Lady&rsquo;s, Ennis.  The reorganisation of services which these closures entailed has resulted in the expansion of community facilities, new acute psychiatric units in some cases and, most importantly, an overall improvement in the delivery of services for the service users, their families and carers.</P>
        <P>Most of the remaining stand-alone psychiatric hospitals in the country cater in the main for long-stay patients, many of whom are over 65 years of age.  I understand this is also the case at St. Finan&rsquo;s, Killarney, in which the majority of patients are cared for in elderly care wards.</P><Col N="1298"/>
        <P>The HSE has indicated that it anticipates the closure of psychiatric hospitals and the reinvestment of the proceeds in modern, replacement facilities to take place on a phased basis.  It has also emphasised that hospitals can only close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings, such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres, together with a substantial increase in the number of well trained, fully staffed, community-based multidisciplinary community mental health teams.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the recommendations will be a matter primarily for the HSE, which has established an implementation group to ensure the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner.  I have established an independent monitoring group to monitor progress on the implementation of the mental health strategy, A Vision for Change.  The Government has commenced implementation of this strategy and provided &euro;26.2 million in funding in 2006 for this purpose.  A further &euro;25 million has been made available in 2007.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree the Government is fully committed to the implementation of the national mental health strategy, A Vision for Change, as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; television programme starkly revealed the human suffering of those children and parents who have been abandoned by Ireland&rsquo;s under-resourced psychiatric services.  Child and adolescent psychiatric services account for only 5% to 10% of spending on mental health services, while serving 22.68% of the population.  This underinvestment has resulted, as Members saw last week, in child and adolescent services which are sporadic or non-existent.</P>
        <P>The Kerry Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service is based in Greenview Clinic and is run by the Brothers of Charity.  The clinic deals with children who experience severe and complex behavioural difficulties such as ADHD.  At present, the waiting period for assessment at Greenview Clinic depends on the category in which one is considered to be &mdash; general, priority 2, which is semi-urgent, or urgent.  There are 11 children currently in the general category, with a waiting period of 56 months &mdash; four years and eight months.  There are 109 individuals on the priority 2 list, with a waiting period of 22 months, and there are 83 individuals on the urgent list, with a 16-month waiting time.</P>
        <P>Figures obtained from the Health Service Executive under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that, nationally, over 3,000 children under the age of 16 are on waiting lists to get an assess<Col N="1299"/>ment.  The length of the waiting time depends on where one lives.  In Dublin, the waiting time is two years, while it is three years in Mayo and, in many cases, over four years in Kerry.</P>
        <P>According to an unpublished Health Service Executive report on child mental health teams, in September of this year there were only nine psychiatric nurses in the HSE, south, area, when really there should be 24.  In a survey of teachers from over 200 schools, many of which were in Kerry, conducted by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and the Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Association, over three quarters stated that their teaching had been compromised by a pupil with a mental health problem.</P>
        <P>Mental health services for children in Kerry are under-resourced, understaffed, fragmented and inaccessible in many cases.  Planning nationally has been haphazard and there are only two public units for adolescents in Ireland.  Two, three or four year waiting times are devastating for children, who deteriorate enormously in that period without diagnosis or treatment.</P>
        <P>Spending on mental health has halved in the 18 years from 1988 to 2006 and Ireland now has the fifth highest youth suicide rate in Europe.  Many of these illnesses, including ADHD, are eminently treatable but for this to happen, early diagnosis is crucial and must be followed up with the administration of the relevant medication and training strategies and facility provision for the child and the parents involved.</P>
        <P>The lack of psychotherapists, family therapists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and other key staff seriously inhibits the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services through multidisciplinary teams.</P>
        <P>Mental illness can affect any one of us at any time.  It is estimated that one in four of us suffers with a mental illness, but the Government does not seem to recognise this area.  Since 1997, the proportion of the total health budget spent in this area has dropped from 11% to under 7%.  Mental health has been neglected for too long.</P>
        <P>This neglect is manifesting itself now in County Kerry.  People were amazed by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report on the services for young people in County Kerry.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, as a Deputy from a neighbouring county, to take on board the challenge faced at this time by the people who are involved in the services in County Kerry.  There is a major difficulty in Kerry.  I do not want to exaggerate for the sake of effect, but I appeal to the Minister of State to look to the HSE to draw up a special report based on what an independent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; reporter discovered in County Kerry.  I trust that he will take on board the points I have made.  The issue is too important to ignore and to fail to follow it up with positive initiatives.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter.  I assure the House that work is continuing towards ensuring that appropriate psychological assessment of children with mental health problems takes place without delay.</P>
        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services is assigned to the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004.  I am of the view that waiting lists must be constantly kept under review to ensure that children and adolescents are referred to and seen by an appropriate professional as soon as possible and that urgent cases are prioritised for immediate assessment.</P>
        <P>An exercise is under way in the HSE to assess what needs to change in particular areas, including Kerry, to reduce waiting times.  Dramatic improvements in waiting times can be, and have been, achieved.  For example, the child mental health services in Kildare succeeded in greatly reducing their waiting times following the appointment of an advanced nurse practitioner who worked in close collaboration with the local multidisciplinary team to improve service access.</P>
        <P>This is the type of service improvement I want to see achieved elsewhere in the country.  It has been done practically, effectively and cost effectively.  I have asked the HSE today to learn from this experience and apply it to reduce waiting times and improve access to child and adolescent services nationally, starting with those areas where access problems and delays are occurring.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by HSE, south, that the Greenview Clinic, Kerry Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services run by the Brothers of Charity, provides a community outpatient multidisciplinary mental health service to children and adolescents in County Kerry on behalf of the HSE.  All clinical cases referred to the service are prioritised based on clinical severity and complexity.  Emergency cases, such as children who have self-harmed or are at risk of doing so, are seen immediately and are not placed on a waiting list.</P>
        <P>Improving awareness and detection rates of mental health problems in young people is an important Government priority.  The HSE has developed an on-line training programme for GPs with a comprehensive module on child and adolescent mental health needs.  This is an important development and builds on expertise and knowledge within our services.</P>
        <P>The HSE child and adolescent mental health services work closely with colleagues in the education sector and accept referrals from schools and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  The HSE is also actively working with a number of voluntary and community agencies to provide added protection for children with mental health difficulties.  Examples include Dublin East Treatment and Early Care Team, DETECT<b>, </b>in south Dublin, Ireland&rsquo;s first pilot <Col N="1301"/>project for early intervention in psychosis assessment, as well as the national roll-out of applied suicide intervention skills training, ASSIST, with a particular emphasis on personnel who work with young people.</P>
        <P>The national mental health policy, A Vision for Change, sets out the model of child and adolescent mental health service that needs to be provided and resourced into the future.  A Vision for Change acknowledges gaps in the current provision of child and adolescent services and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.  Recommendations include early intervention and health promotion programmes, primary and community care services, specialist mental health services for the treatment of complex disorders and the provision of additional child community mental health teams.  The Government has already commenced implementation of this strategy and provided &euro;26.2 million in funding in 2006 for this purpose.  A further &euro;25 million has been made available in 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE currently has 45 child and adolescent mental health teams.  Eight additional consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatric teams per year will be established nationally for the next four years to enhance community and inpatient services.  This year, an additional &euro;3.25 million was allocated for the enhancement of child and adolescent services, including the development of eight new teams.  A further &euro;7.95 million is being provided for 2007 to significantly improve both community and hospital based services and facilitate the provision of early intervention services.  The additional funding will enhance the multidisciplinary composition of existing child and adolescent mental health teams and provide for the development of a further eight new teams in 2007.  Additional beds for the treatment of children and adolescents are to be made available shortly pending the construction of four new dedicated 20-bed child and adolescent units in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that HSE mental health services are now funded on a population based model which takes account of population size and profile, including factors such as social deprivation.  Services are being planned and resourced from a national perspective.  From March 2007, the HSE will have more detailed information on the age profile of our population with the further analysis of the 2006 census data.  This will allow the executive to target resources to areas of greatest need and to ensure the most appropriate services are available to young people throughout the country.  In addition, recognising the link between social deprivation and mental illness, the HSE this year used a deprivation index to direct additional resources to areas of greatest need.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to decreasing the waiting times <Col N="1302"/>for psychological assessment for children with mental health problems in Kerry and across the country.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.  A number of constituents have contacted me about the unacceptable waiting times to get an appointment for assessment at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital following diagnosis of arthritis by their GPs.  In one case, my constituent was given an appointment for 12 months later following referral by her GP.  This lady waited for a few months in some considerable pain and then decided, at significant personal financial hardship, to get a private assessment in a different hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Arising from the information provided by this lady and a number of others, I made inquiries with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to establish the average waiting times and the number of patients awaiting assessment and treatment.  There are approximately 500 patients on the waiting list.  I understand the average waiting time for assessment is 15 to 18 months following referral by a GP.  If the case is defined as urgent, it can take as long as four months to be seen by a consultant, unless the patient is admitted as an emergency case.</P>
        <P>From my constituent&rsquo;s perspective, living in pain for 12 to 18 months was the immediate concern.  However, what might not be obvious to her or other people suffering from arthritis is that many long-term effects are associated with delayed treatment.  These include irreversible joint damage and internal organ damage.  It is estimated that a delay in providing treatment for inflammatory arthritis can reduce life expectancy by ten years.  Many related medical problems, including heart disease, osteoporosis and increased susceptibility to infections and cancer may also develop as a consequence of delayed treatment.  Early diagnosis, assessment and treatment indicate a more positive outcome for patients.</P>
        <P>What plans are in place to reduce waiting times for these patients?  What resources will be provided to St. James&rsquo;s to allow waiting lists to be addressed and patients to be seen within a reasonable timeframe?</P>
        <P>Preventative medicine is the Cinderella of the health service.  Early intervention would make a huge difference to the quality of life of my constituent.  In the case of the other 500 patients on the waiting list, it would also result in long-term savings to the State if the consequential illnesses were prevented.  This debate is about quality of life, the avoidance of unnecessary pain and the right to access medical treatment when recommended by a GP.  It is about life expectancy and the avoidance of other complications setting in later in life.  It is also about wise investment and <Col N="1303"/>management of resources so that prevention becomes the priority.</P>
        <P>We all know people suffering from arthritis.  While it may not have a high profile medically because it is not seen as life threatening, the hidden consequences should give food for thought.  I ask the Minister to put in place the personnel, services and facilities to reduce the suffering of the patients I have mentioned.</P>
        <P>I visited St. James&rsquo;s Hospital because of the concerns raised by my constituent.  I found the staff with responsibility for the care and management of patients with arthritis are doing their best to accommodate as many patients as possible in conditions that leave much to be desired.  I urge the Minister to undertake to review the provision of facilities and staff resources for the delivery of arthritis related services.  It is not good enough that up to 500 patients are left waiting and in pain for a service that could easily be enhanced and upgraded for a relatively modest investment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter.  I am responding to this on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services is assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004, and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall Vote.  The former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al undertook a review of rheumatology services and published its report in 2005.  The report recommends the creation of additional consultant posts in rheumatology and recognises the need for the appropriate allied health professional staff, including physiotherapists, to work alongside consultants in a multidisciplinary team approach.  Responsibility for the implementation of the report rests with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The executive has advised that it established a working group on arthritis and related conditions earlier this year.  The group reflects the range of stakeholder interests in this area including consultant medical, specialist nursing, GP and patient input.  The group will undertake a comprehensive needs assessment, propose a model of care and make recommendations for the development and reconfiguration of services across the full spectrum of care.  The HSE has also identified chronic disease management as a priority and arthritis<b> </b>is included within this category.  To address chronic diseases, the HSE has this year established an innovative self-care management programme and hopes to develop this further in future years.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Treatment Purchase Fund<b> </b>was established in 2002 to deal with those public patients who are longest on public hospital waiting lists.  To date, more than 50,000 inpatients have been treated under <Col N="1304"/>this initiative.  Happily, we are now at a stage where most public patients who have been waiting more than three months on a public hospital waiting list for a surgical procedure can access the NTPF.</P>
        <P>The main referral pathway for arthritis sufferers is via a general practitioner to either an orthopaedic or a rheumatology outpatient clinic for assessment.  At the Minister&rsquo;s request, the NTPF expanded its activity in 2006 to include working with public hospitals on outpatient waiting lists.  The fund also undertook an outpatient initiative on a pilot basis on the rheumatology outpatient waiting lists in Galway and a further pilot is being undertaken in Dublin with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>

      <sTitle>Flood Relief.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised this matter so the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government might provide emergency funds to Roscommon County Council so that it might raise a number of roads in the county, particularly in the south Roscommon villages of Clonown, Cloncoran, Moore and Derrycahill-Ballyforan, where the roads servicing a large number of families are flooded to a depth that leaves them impassable.</P>
        <P>It is a sad state of affairs that in the mouth of Christmas 2006 up to 50 families are marooned in south Roscommon.  A large number of roads into the villages I mentioned are not sufficiently raised above flood level.  I brought this issue to the Government in 2001.  Some &euro;500,000 was allocated and the raising of roads took place.  Due to the passage of time and a more severe flood, that raising of road levels is not sufficient today.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister of State may say Roscommon County Council has been given an allocation in recent days to deal with this.  That is not adequate nor appropriate funding for raising of roads.  In many cases these roads need to be raised by up to three feet.  This would allow those villagers to go to Mass, visit the doctor, go to school or go shopping in times of flood.  It is a sad state of affairs that people in south Roscommon must use tractors and lorries to traverse the roads and go about their day-to-day business.</P>
        <P>I have been in touch with the HSE and understand that a four wheel drive ambulance has been made available in case of emergencies.  I have asked for the Army to be put on alert in case people, stock or fodder have to be moved.  There is great hardship in the farming community, with 50,000 acres under flood.  I will urge tonight that Roscommon County Council be given the moneys to raise the roads to the village of Clonown in south Roscommon and to smaller villages off the Carricknaughton Road, as well as the Carricknaughton Road itself, by a minimum of two feet.  Cloncoran is cut off, with water to a depth of 1.5 feet on the road.  In certain areas of <Col N="1305"/>the parish of Moore people cannot get to fodder their stock.  Derrycahill, on the banks of the River Suck, is cut off by two feet of water and only one person on a tractor has been able to get out of the village for almost a week.  The Ballyforan-Feevagh Road is cut off to children attending Feevagh national school, who must undertake a five-mile round trip.</P>
        <P>This is totally unacceptable in the Ireland of today, with the coffers overflowing with money.  These people are in a desperate situation and the hardship inflicted on them by this flood is unacceptable.  I call on the Minister to immediately enter negotiations with the manager of Roscommon County Council, Mr. John Tiernan, and his staff, to make available adequate funds.  I am not talking about large funds or spending millions of euro to build highways, I am talking about raising stretches of road that will allow people to gain access to their farms and, in particular, to their houses, places of worship, shops, doctors and other services they may need.  It is not asking too much to provide people with a basic entitlement such as a road to their house that is not under two feet of water.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the extra funding given by the Minister to all county councils but an enormous expenditure will have to be undertaken by Roscommon County Council to repair the roads damaged by the flood.  I ask that emergency funds be provided for Roscommon County Council for the repair of roads to houses and villages and that negotiations start immediately with the county manager and his staff so that we can tell the people of south Roscommon they are not abandoned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I reply on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.</P>
        <P>County councils and other major local authorities are responsible for managing and maintaining all non-national roads in their area.  They have to commit an appropriate share of their own resources for this purpose.  In addition, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government assesses the non-national roads programmes of local authorities each year and makes substantial grant allocations to local authorities which supplement their own resources.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the total of these grant allocations from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to Roscommon County Council for non-national roads was &euro;15.254 million.  This represents increases of 216%, 124% and over 20% respectively on the corresponding 1994, 1997 and 2005 payments to the council.</P>
        <P>The question of special funding to take account of severe impact of weather conditions on roads is regularly raised.  The approach taken by the <Col N="1306"/>Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under successive Ministers, and agreed with local authorities is that we do not hold back a reserve allocation at central level to deal with weather contingencies.  Such an arrangement would mean a reduction across all local authorities in the road grant allocations to them at the beginning of each year.  Instead, the allocation made by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to local authorities is inclusive of the weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall non-national roads resources to finance necessary weather-related works.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the discretionary improvement grant allocation to Roscommon County Council is &euro;1,014,000, an increase of 7% on the initial 2005 allocation.  The selection of works to be funded from this allocation is, in line with what I have said, a matter for the council.  On 25 January 2006, after the 2006 non-national road grant allocations had been announced, Roscommon County Council wrote to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government seeking a special allocation of &euro;100,000 for a study on the ground conditions, methods of construction and cost of carrying out improvement works on the Athlone to Clonown Road.  The council was informed that the 2006 grants were fully allocated but that it was open to the council to use a combination of its own resources and discretionary improvement grant allocation for this purpose.</P>
        <P>The council was also informed that, as an alternative, if a suitable formal application were submitted, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would be prepared to consider giving approval to the council to proceed with the study on the condition that the scheme would be submitted as a priority on the council&rsquo;s 2007 EU co-financed specific improvement grant list of applications.</P>
        <P>In July this year, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government sought applications for consideration for funding in 2007 under that scheme.  Last month, Roscommon County Council submitted, <i>inter alia</i>, an application for &euro;50,000, for consideration for funding in 2007, for the appointment of consultants to enable a detailed study of the Clonown Road to be carried out.  This application will be considered in the context of the 2007 non-national road grant allocations.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, will announce these allocations early in the new year.</P>
        <P>General purpose grants from the local government fund may also be used by local authorities to meet their ongoing and special expenditure requirements, including flood relief.  In this regard, I have announced increased local govern<Col N="1307"/>ment fund allocations of almost &euro;948 million in general purpose grants to all local authorities in 2007.  Roscommon County Council will receive an allocation of &euro;22,198,317 in 2007, which represents an increase of over 7% on its 2006 allocation.</P>
        <P>The weather conditions of recent times undoubtedly create difficulties for the road infrastructure and for road users in parts of Roscommon.  Problems of this kind call for adap<Col N="1308"/>tation and prioritisation on the part of the local authority concerned, with the assistance of the considerably increased funds being made available by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I encourage Roscommon County Council and all local authorities facing similar challenges to find solutions within this framework.</P>

        <P>Expenditure under the Programme this year is expected to reach approx. &euro;20.5m. The under-spend is mainly due to some of the new areas not progressing with projects as quickly as anticipated earlier in the year.</P><Col N="1310"/>

        <P>I have no plans at present for a further review of the Programme in terms of expanding the areas covered.  However, the measures being operated under the Programme are kept under on-going review by my Department who are in regular contact with other Government Departments/Agencies in relation to the possible introduction of new measures relevant to the remit of the Programme.</P>

	<P el="0">I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>The 2007 Estimates provision of just over &euro;43m represents a continuation of the increased level of funding that I have secured to tackle the problem of drugs misuse in recent years.  The similar allocation for the Drugs Initiative/Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund in 2006 represented an increase of 37% on the original 2005 allocation and a massive 61% increase on the 2004 figure.  The 2007 allocation will allow us to consolidate and build on previous investment and to continue our efforts to tackle the drug problem.</P>
        <P>Tackling the problem of drugs misuse is a key priority for Government and will continue to be so.  When mainstreamed projects are included, the Government is spending &euro;70m per year on projects that originated at community level.</P>
        <P>An initial total allocation of &euro;5m was allocated to the ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) in 2006 to commence the implementation of their action plans and significant progress has been made. It is envisaged that funding will be increased on an incremental basis to achieve the full rollout of the RDTF plans.</P>
        <P>A total of 96 projects have been started across the ten regions this year. The projects involved range from prevention initiatives and work with youth to treatment services and outreach work, in line with the actions identified in the plans.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, capital funding is now available to Regional Drugs Task Forces through the Premises Initiative Fund, which was established to address the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects.</P>

This was in order to give Deputies and Senators the opportunity to debate the draft regulations and to make suggestions for amendments, if they so wish, before I sign them.</P>
        <P>The measures proposed in the draft regulations would make the Irish language more easily available in a measured way to Irish speakers throughout the State.</P>
        <P>I had the opportunity to debate the draft regulations at the Committee Stage on 29 November 2006 and again today.  As I indicated at the Joint Committee today, the debate on the draft regulations has been very useful and I welcome the contributions made by the participants.  I will consider all the points made and I intend to make a further announcement in relation to these draft regulations in due course.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, much of the work completed on Gaeltacht Improvement Schemes was carried out under the seven year NDP programme. However, 2006 was <Col N="1315"/>an exceptional year in that more projects than anticipated were completed due to a number of factors, including the good weather we enjoyed earlier in the year. At this stage, it is expected that in excess of &euro;22m will have been spent on these schemes before the end of this year, an increase of almost 40% on the 2006 allocation. This means that the overall programme is well ahead of the targets originally set for the period to end-2006 &mdash; indeed, it is estimated that a total of &euro;97m will have been spent on Gaeltacht improvement works in the period 2000-2006 and clearly this has knock-on effects on the amount of funding required for the schemes in 2007. The result of this investment is plain to be seen in all Gaeltacht areas in the form of improved roads, marine works, and community and leisure facilities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 56 and 99 together.</P>
        <P>I am fully aware, through my own contacts and that of my officials with the relevant Departments and Agencies involved in the roll-out of the National Drugs Strategy, of the increase in the <Col N="1316"/>number of large drug seizures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I congratulate them on these successes.  I am in regular contact with the Department of Justice Equality &amp; Law Reform through the National Drugs Strategy structures in relation to Garda work and other drug-related matters.  Furthermore, I periodically meet with senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are involved in the drugs area.  Meanwhile, contact with the Department of Finance is maintained in relation to funding issues.</P>
        <P>Varying views have been expresses on the impact of recent drug seizures on price and availability.  It is not possible at this point to conclusively identify the degree of such impact, especially in a situation where an above average harvest has lead to increased supplies of heroin globally.</P>
        <P>The drug problem in Ireland continues to evolve and I have been aware for some time of the emergence of cocaine as an increasing problem, as well as the increasing issue of polydrug use.  While there is anecdotal evidence about a possible substitution effect with respect to cocaine, no hard evidence is available to back this up.  However, I am certainly not aware of any substitution effect from cannabis or ecstasy to heroin and I would not accept that we are facing a heroin epidemic.</P>
        <P>The nature of any relationship between the level of drugs seizures and the prevalence of drug usage is extremely difficult to determine.  Our most comprehensive figures for the misuse of drugs arise from the Drug Prevalence Survey 2002/2003.  Fieldwork for the second such Survey is currently in progress and will be completed in April 2007, with first reports becoming available in the Autumn.   With respect to heroin specifically, the Capture Recapture Study was published by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs in 2003 and a further such study is to be commissioned in 2007.  These surveys will give us a much clearer view of the prevalence and changing nature of drug misuse in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 64 together.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the conclusion of the Drug Policy Action Group paper that the Government and Garda authorities need to completely rethink and liberalise their approach to the illicit drug trade nor do I agree that senior Government officials, judges and Garda&iacute; at the coalface of the drugs problem do not understand the issues.</P>
        <P>In the first instance, I would point out that the paper includes a disclaimer advising that the views expressed are those of the authors only and are not necessarily the views of all members of the Drugs Action policy Group.</P>
        <P>The Mid-Term review of the National Drugs Strategy (NDS), which was completed in 2005, found that the current aims and objectives of the Strategy are fundamentally sound and that progress is being made across the pillars.  The Steering Group for that review included representatives from the NDST and the community and voluntary sectors, and an extensive public consultation process was also undertaken at that time.</P>
        <P>I believe that there are encouraging signs of progress over the past couple of years &mdash; be it in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion of treatment services, the establishment of the Regional Drugs Task Forces, prevention programmes in schools or the increasing focus on rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>With respect to an international perspective on whether a policy of containment works, the United Nations Office for Drugs Control (UNODC) in its 2006 report argues that there is ample evidence that the approach of making drugs illegal, which is broadly adopted internationally, is effective and this rebuts a fundamental plank of the paper&rsquo;s thesis on the need for a liberalisation of the approach in place.</P>
        <P>Illegal drug use is a global issue and so our efforts to tackle it in Ireland must be seen in that context.  Against this background, I feel that it is na&iuml;ve to believe that Ireland can be kept totally drug-free.  It is my view that a change in the law regarding the possession of cannabis, or a reclassification of the drug, would be of no benefit whatsoever in tackling drug use here &mdash; in fact, I think that it would aggravate the problem.</P>
        <P>While cannabis may not be as dangerous as some other drugs, the evidence is that it is damaging to the physical and mental health of the user, particularly the young and those who are heavy users.  A recent report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs emphasises these points.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy notes, an increase of 13% &mdash; &euro;295,000 &mdash; has been provided in the Estimates of my Department for the Western Development Commission (WDC) for 2007.</P>
        <P>An element of the overall increase has been allocated to cover the usual year on year administrative increases incurred by organisations like the WDC in order for them to carry on their business.  The WDC is also involved in increased activity in a number of areas, for example, their &lsquo;Look West&rsquo; campaign, which adds to their overall administrative costs.</P>
        <P>The allocation for 2007 also provides for the additional resources required to continue to effectively minimise the investment risks involved in the administration of the Western Investment Fund.  The Fund was set up to provide seed and venture capital to businesses in the Western Region. The investments are high risk in nature but are made on a commercial basis and repayment of the investment with a return is expected.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report progress with their projects under the RAPID programme.  In support of my Department, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on <Col N="1323"/>Pobal&rsquo;s website under the RAPID section (http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID). The Deputy may find it helpful to access this information. I understand that full data in respect of the year 2006 will not be collected until early 2007.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I launched the RAPID Leverage Fund in 2004 to support small-scale projects identified by the Area Implemen<Col N="1324"/>tation Teams.  The Exchequer provides the funding for these schemes.</P>
        <P>The following are the allocations I have approved for each of the Leverage Schemes.  Expenditure relates to the position at the end of November 2006.  While some expenditure is expected in the month of December, I do not expect the final outcome for 2006 to differ greatly from the position indicated.</P><Col N="1323"/>

        <P FLI="0">Of course RAPID areas benefit from spending under programmes other than the RAPID. Disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund are made within the overall framework of the Disbursement Plan provided for in the legislation.  Under the initial round of funding, the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board approved 521 projects for funding totalling over &euro;60 million.  Consistent with the direction given by Government when approving the Disbursement Plan, approximately &euro;32 million of these approvals were in respect of projects based within RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, further funding was ring-fenced to support priority projects in RAPID areas under the 2006 round of funding &euro;11.35 million was subsequently allocated in support of 188 projects.</P>
        <P>My Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTF) and 10 Regional Drugs Task Forces.  The LDTFs were established in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin, and many of them have RAPID areas within them.  Over &euro;150 million has been allocated to the Task Forces to implement two rounds of local action plans.  A further &euro;14.36 million has been allocated to capital projects under the LDTF Premises Initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects.</P>
        <P>Approximately &euro;108 million has been allocated to-date to support the work of the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund in LDTF areas and four other urban centres.  The main aim of the Fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in dis<Col N="1324"/>advantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.  It is not possible to quantify the exact spend in RAPID areas.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that the matter raised is primarily one for my colleague, the Minister for Transport. I can assure the Deputy, however, that I certainly do not think that driving under the influence of drugs is acceptable nor do I believe that there is a trend towards acceptance of driving while under the influence of drugs among the general public.</P>
        <P>A report &ldquo;Driving under the Influence of Drugs in Ireland: A Nationwide Survey 2000 &mdash; 2001&rdquo;, which was published in 2004, highlighted the issue as a cause for some concern.  That survey involved drug analysis of 2,000 specimens, 1,000 of which had tested under the limit for alcohol and 1,000 of which were over that limit.  The survey found that 15.7% tested positive for some <Col N="1325"/>drug, with cannabinoids being involved in 60% of these cases.</P>
        <P>It is illegal to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of a vehicle.  There are currently no means available to Garda&iacute; to carry out roadside tests for the presence of drugs in drivers.  However, I understand that new equipment will be tested by the Garda&iacute; next year under an EU pilot initiative organised by TISPOL, the European network of police forces.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 98 together.</P>
        <P>The River Nore Valley Walking Route will cover the approximate 35 kilometres between Kilkenny City and the village of Inistioge.  The project is a jointly-funded partnership between the LEADER agency Barrow Nore Suir Rural Development (BNS) and Kilkenny County Council, through the River Nore Valley Walking Route Committee.  The project committee has representatives from and is also actively supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, other development agencies, leisure interest clubs and local community groups.  The Board of BNS Rural Development has allocated &euro;92,000 of LEADER+ funding towards the completion of a series of walking route projects in its region of Kilkenny and southeast Tipperary.</P>
        <P>The project is supported by a team of four workers from the Rural Social Scheme (RSS), which undertake the actual construction work on the Nore Walk. This team of local farmers live in the area of the walk and thanks to the project are employed in developing a major support to rural tourism in the region.  The project is an example of the supports that the Department has made available to rural tourism interests to develop walking routes in the country.</P>
        <P>The development committee has been very happy with the support they have received from most of the landowners on the route.  The committee&rsquo;s policy has been to develop the walk as <Col N="1326"/>far as is possible, by securing permission from landowners to cross their property.  As the promoters have put in place a comprehensive insurance and maintenance regime for the walk, the &lsquo;permissive path&rsquo; approach to developing the route has been largely successful.</P>
        <P>There are a small number of landowners, who have declined permission for the route. The promoters are endeavouring to negotiate with these landowners to reach a mutually satisfactory accommodation.  The promoters have been aware of the concerns of landowners and have been prepared, where possible to address these.  If in the near future, permission cannot be secured on the basis of permissive path status, the promoters will look at all other legitimate options to allow the successful completion of the route by spring of 2007 in time of the next tourist season.</P>
        <P>Nationally, I do envisage a role for walking routes in the Countryside Recreation Strategy, which I received from Comhairle na Tuaithe in September and I am taking a number of immediate actions arising from my initial consideration of the report. I have made &euro;1.5 million funding available for capital work under the rural social scheme and I will ask implementing bodies, which are in most cases Leader companies, to give particular priority to walkways and ancillary services.</P>
        <P>My Department is also actively pursuing the possibility of using former railway infrastructure as recreational trails for cycling etc. with the Department of Transport and Iarnr&oacute;d  &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland has already identified a selection of looped walks which it has publicised in its brochure &mdash; Walking Ireland &mdash; and on its website.  My Department in consultation with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Comhar LEADER na  h&Eacute;ireann and  the National Waymarked Ways Advisory Committee are identifying further looped walks and waymarked ways for development.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the recommendations of the report of the Drug Policy Action Group on &ldquo;Social care and drug users in Ireland&rdquo;.   The recommendations therein are broadly in line with Actions of the National Drugs Strategy, focusing primarily on providing a continuum of care for clients and ensuring that quality standards are achieved in the services provided.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation was established, arising from the Mid-Term Review of the National <Col N="1327"/>Drugs Strategy, to examine the existing provision of rehabilitation services in Ireland, identify best practice, identify gaps and recommend actions to develop an integrated rehabilitation service.  The Group has taken a holistic view of rehabilitation and, while recognising the importance of clients being activated and prepared to fulfil their role in the effort towards rehabilitation, sees the empowering of recovering drug users, so that they can re-engage with society in a manner consistent with their needs and expectations, as a key aim of the process.</P>
        <P>It is likely that the report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation, which will be completed shortly with a view to initiating the implementation of its recommendations in 2007, will address the broad issues raised in the Drug Policy Action Group report.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the supports provided to enable Traveller communities access employment through his Department&rsquo;s community development programme since 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Travellers are one of a number of target groups that benefit under the Community Development Programme.  While a significant number of the 182 projects currently within the Programme would identify Travellers among beneficiaries of their activities and services, 21 projects specifically focus on providing Traveller support.</P>
        <P>Training courses, support groups, provision of information, work experience, and childcare provision are examples of the type of supports typically made available.  Traveller projects also provide employment opportunities for Travellers as Co-ordinators and/or Development Workers within the projects.</P>
        <P>Funding for Traveller projects under the Programme from 2002 to 2006 is outlined in the following appendix.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, community development projects act as a conduit for funding from other statutory agencies.  In this way, many further employment opportunities also exist for outreach workers/health workers and so on for the Travelling Community.  It would not be possible for me to provide a breakdown of such instances as projects do not provide information to the Department in respect of the background of employees.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, my Department, with the assistance of Community Development Projects, introduced a scheme of work placements for <Col N="1329"/>Travellers in 2005. The objective of the scheme is to provide positive short-term work experiences and training opportunities for Travellers that will prepare, encourage and support participants in seeking employment.</P>
        <P>During 2005, twenty-two Travellers in 17 Community Development Projects benefited from an eight week-long work placement scheme.  This scheme received funding of approximately &euro;58,000.  In light of the positive results achieved during the 2005 scheme, I have provided funding to facilitate Community Development Projects with further placements in 2006.   Fifteen projects employing 26 workers for a 12 week period will receive funding of approximately &euro;108,000.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Community Development Programme, several projects related to the Travelling community are funded by my Department as part of our support for the community and voluntary sector under the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity.  The National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum receives approximately &euro;47,000 per annum under the multi-annual funding arrangement. This arrangement is for three and a half years, ending mid-2007.  The National Association of Travellers Centres receives &euro;35,000 per annum towards their provision of informal edu<Col N="1330"/>cation to the Travelling Community in Ireland through its youth work services. Their aims are to support the provision of a comprehensive Youth Work Programme of Activities throughout the country for young travellers.</P>
        <P>The Exchange House Travellers Service receives &euro;20,000 per annum.  This is an organisation of Travellers and settled people working together which aims to provide quality outreach family support, a welfare rights service and to assist in community development, youth services, money and advice and budgeting.  The Department also provides multi-annual funding to the Irish Traveller Movement of &euro;150,220 per annum. Their objective is to ensure Traveller human rights issues are put on Government policy agendas through the participation in a wide range of Government Committees and within the wider Community and Voluntary Sector.</P>
        <P>In addition, quite a few projects related to the Travelling community are provided with once-off funding by this Department under the Programme of Grants for Locally-Based Community and Voluntary Organisations. Projects which provide employment opportunities for Travellers are also funded under the Community Services Programme.</P><Col N="1329"/>

	<P>While I have not had detailed discussions with either the Department of Justice Equality &amp; Law Reform nor the Department of Health &amp; Children on the specific issue of the introduction of a UK style drugs classification system, I do not think that the introduction of such a system would assist efforts to combat the spread of serious drugs such as heroin and cocaine and there are no plans at present to adopt such an approach.</P>
        <P>Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984, the various offences created have associated penalties depending on the seriousness of the offence.  These range from possible life imprisonment in the case of serious crimes involving drugs to lesser penalties for offences such as the possession of cannabis for personal use.</P>
        <P>Possession of any controlled drug, without due authorisation, is an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.   The legislation makes a distinction between possession for personal use and possession for sale or supply.  Penalties for possession also depend on the type of substance and the penal proceedings involved (whether a summary conviction or a conviction on indictment is obtained).</P>
        <P>I again stress the seriousness with which the Government is addressing the issue of substance <Col N="1332"/>misuse in Ireland and I do not think that the application of a UK style drugs classification system would strengthen our response in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware my Department administers and delivers a wide range of programmes and measures targeted at social or economic deprivation and its consequences in either rural or urban areas and at community development, both local and national. Funding has been made available or is potentially available, for the specific purposes adverted to by the Deputy under a number of these programmes and measures.</P>
        <P>In pursuance of the National Drugs Strategy, Drugs Task Forces covering all parts of the country have developed detailed strategies and plans which aim to oversee a co-ordinated response to illicit drugs use having regard to the level of existing services. Many of the plans developed include actions to engage young people to participate in programmes and activities in drug and alcohol free environments, many with an educational preventative content.</P>
        <P>The Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund is targeted at young people in the age range of 10 to 21 years who are defined as &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; due to factors such as family circumstances, educational disadvantage, or involvement in crime or substance misuse.  Under the Fund, the Department has supported approximately 460 facility and services projects with a total allocation to date of over &euro;108m.  Among the facilities involved are drop in facilities for young people and a small number of youth caf&eacute;s.</P>
        <P>Disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund are targeted at, inter alia, those affected by economic or social disadvantage and those affected by educational disadvantage.  Among the measures approved by Government for assistance from Dormant Accounts in 2006 is one which provides for the ring-fencing of up to &euro;11.5 million for projects identified as priorities by RAPID Area Implementation Teams.  In this regard, details of the 188 projects approved under this measure were announced in July 2006, including 5 projects which involved the allocation of funds to support youth cafes.</P>
        <P>In addition, funding totalling &euro;204,227 was allocated to Youth Projects under Cohesion and Volunteering during 2004 and 2005.</P>
        <P>Funding may also be sought from the Community Development Programme.  This is a programme which was designed to reduce social exclusion by targeting support at disadvantaged and socially excluded communities in order to improve their capacity to benefit from social and economic development.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;24 million has been allocated to the Programme in 2006. This will bring funding to approximately &euro;148m under the Programme through the current National Development Plan since the foundation of the Department in 2002.</P><Col N="1334"/>
        <P>Funded projects are expected to:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 89 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to combating poverty amongst farmers and to this end, two specific schemes are targeted at the most vulnerable farmers i.e. the Rural Social Scheme (RSS) and the Smallholder Initiative.</P>
        <P>The RSS was introduced to allow low-income farmers and fishermen who are unable to earn an adequate living from their farm holding/fishing, to earn a supplementary income. The Scheme aims to encourage farmers and fishermen to continue to farm and fish while providing them with additional financial support. In addition, the talents and skills widely available amongst our farmers and fishermen are being harnessed for the benefit of rural communities.</P>
        <P>The Scheme has proven to be very popular and as of Friday, 1st December, there were 2,593 participants on the RSS out of the 2,600 places currently available.  I expect the remaining places to be filled in early 2007. The number of participants on a county basis is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>As part of the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme, 25 rural Partnerships implement a dedicated Smallholder Initiative &mdash; formerly known as the Low Income Smallholder Household Initiative (LISHI). The LISHI was <Col N="1335"/>established by rural Partnerships in 1996 in response to a recognition that many farm families were becoming increasingly marginalised and their needs were not being met through existing supports / service provision mechanisms.</P>
        <P>The LISHI works with the most disadvantaged farming households. It provides facilitation, support and guidance to disadvantaged households to help them adapt to changing economic realities. It provides flexible, local responses, and it complements and makes use of existing mainstream services. The focus is on the household as a whole, with a view to securing a viable household income &mdash; be it from farming and/or off-farm opportunities. Elements of the Initiative include:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Outreach to the most marginalised farm households;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Ensuring households are aware of their entitlements;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Exploring available options in line with family circumstances;</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Making agreed referral and follow-up support to mainstream agencies;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />In some cases (if not locally available) the provision on an outreach basis of training and up-skilling courses for family members.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Between 2002 and 2005, 7,415 people (2,098 women and 5,317 men) were actively supported under the Initiative. Over this period, 37% were supported into education and training, 9% were place in employment, and 4% started up new enterprises.</P>
        <P>Other programmes operated by my Department &mdash; such as the CL&Aacute;R Programme &mdash; also tackle social exclusion in rural communities. CL&Aacute;R funds or co-funds, together with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These investments support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a wide range of measures and reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas. This funding helps rural communities overcome local difficulties and achieve access to a range of essential services such as water supply, sewerage disposal, road access, broadband communication, community and economic infrastructure, etc.</P>

	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated RAPID areas.  In addition, RAPID priority status was recently extended to Ballyfermot. My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.  The provision in my Department under Subhead O of the Vote funds administrative costs in RAPID Area Implementation Teams and Pobal and the RAPID Leverage schemes.  I initiated these schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas. These schemes, which are co-funded by the relevant agencies, fund projects that are chosen locally and focus on estate enhancement, graffiti clean-up, <Col N="1337"/>traffic calming measures, CCTV, health facilities, top-up grants to sports facilities and the provision of playgrounds.  I am satisfied that the capital allocation of &euro;7.8 million in 2007 is sufficient to meet the funding commitments I have approved for these schemes.</P>
        <P>The allocation should be seen in the context of an increase of 8% or &euro;17.3 million under the Community Affairs heading of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>

	<P>A definitive estimate of the number of cannabis users in Ireland is not available.  The first Drug Prevalence Survey 2002/2003 that was carried out among the 15-64 year age group provides the only national evidence available.</P>
        <P>Of the 4,900 people interviewed for that survey, just over 17% reported some past use of cannabis, with males being almost twice as likely to report such use. Lifetime exposure to cannabis was substantially higher in younger adults aged 15-34 years (24% compared to 11% for adults over 35 years). This mirrors findings from earlier research and confirms the fact that cannabis use by Irish people as they enter early adulthood is a relatively new phenomenon.</P>
        <P>The last year prevalence was 5% in the overall population, and the last month prevalence was 2.6%. Of those who reported use in the past month, 40.7% had only used on a couple of occasions, 14% used several times a week while 22.2% were using on an almost daily basis. Using the latter two figures as a best estimate of regular use (36.2% using several times a week/daily), this would suggest that 0.94% of the population aged 15-64 are regular users of cannabis.  Such a percentage would indicate a much lower figure than 300,000.</P>
        <P>As stated, these figures date back to 2002/2003 and so are of limited use at this stage.  However, they provide base information to facilitate the monitoring of trends going forward.  Fieldwork for the second Drug Prevalence Survey is currently in progress and will be completed in April 2007, with first reports becoming available in the autumn.   This survey will give a clearer view of the prevalence and changing nature of drug misuse, including cannabis, in Ireland.</P>

	<P>Funding to Ireland West Airport Knock (IWAK) has been provided through the Western Investment Fund (WIF) and the CL&Aacute;R Programme.  The WIF is a key element of the Western Development Commission&rsquo;s strategy for accelerating the economic and social development of the Western Region.  The Fund aims to target flagship projects and initiatives with the potential to have a major impact on the region and to accelerate the development of small and medium sized enterprises in the region.</P>
        <P>To date, &euro;2,317,000 has been invested in IWAK through the WIF, in three tranches:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />In December 2003, &euro;317,000 was provided for working capital purposes to enable the airport to develop its master plan and strengthen its management team;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />In December 2005, &euro;1,000,000 was provided for capital purposes to enable the airport to realise its business plan goals; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />In September 2006, &euro;1,000,000 was provided for the acquisition of land for a business park development.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In terms of the CL&Aacute;R Programme, funding of &euro;353,400 was provided to IWAK in 2003 for the upgrade of the car park facilities at the Airport. In 2005, further funding of &euro;1,006,500 was approved for the purchase of two fire tenders at IWAK.</P>
        <P>I am happy that the funding provided to IWAK is helping to fulfil the rural development objectives of my Department, as well as contributing to the continued safe and smooth operation of Airport.  IWAK is a growing international airport with an opportunity to provide a stimulus for economic activity in the Western region. International air access supports and facilitates growth in tourism, in foreign direct investment as well as supporting indigenous enterprise. It also helps to achieve better regional development, which is one of the key aims of my Department.</P>
        <P>Overall, therefore, I strongly support the on-going investment in IWAK which is a major boost for both local business interests and tourism and also for the general economic development of the West.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) annual report for 2006 as it provides us with a contextual framework through which to examine our experience of problem drug use from an overall European perspective.</P>
        <P>Any finding that drugs are at their cheapest for five years, and are probably cheaper than ever before, serves to emphasise the scale of the challenge we face in dealing with the global problems of illicit drugs.  Having said that, and as the report points out, data on street prices is difficult to collect and to interpret as there is considerable potential for variation due to purity, quantity and variety of substance bought.  I would also point out that data from Ireland was not included in that part of survey.</P>
        <P>The prevalence statistics for Ireland used in the report arise from the 2002/2003 Drug Prevalence Survey and so the information has been available for some time.</P>
        <P>The figures for the broad category of psycho-stimulants (amphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy) indicate that, while lifetime prevalence among young adults (15-34 years) for ecstasy was significantly higher than for cocaine, there was little difference between the last year prevalence rates, while the last month rates showed cocaine slightly ahead of ecstasy. These figures would suggest an increasing preference for cocaine.</P>
        <P>I have been aware for some time of the anecdotal evidence of increased cocaine prevalence and, for this reason, last year I asked the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the National Drugs Strategy Team to prepare a Briefing Paper on cocaine.   This Paper was presented at the last Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs (IDG) meeting in September 2006 and the matters arising from it will be followed up further at the next IDG meeting, which is being held tomorrow.</P>
        <P>The second Drug Prevalence Survey, which will provide much information on the extent of the illicit drugs problem and the trends emerging, is now in progress and first reports from this will become available in autumn 2007.</P>

	<P>The Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation is nearing the completion of its work and it is expected that their report will be finalised before the end of the year.  Arrangements will then be made for its publication.</P>
        <P>The Group has taken a holistic view of rehabilitation and, while recognising the importance of clients being activated and prepared to fulfil their role in the effort towards rehabilitation, sees the empowering of recovering problem drug users, so that they can re-engage with society in a manner consistent with their needs and expectations, as a key aim of the process.</P>
        <P>Some of the key recommendations of the Group are likely to focus on ensuring that Actions 47, 48 and 50 of the National Drug Strategy are met.  These Actions largely relate to providing a continuum of care for clients through planned progression paths for each problem drug user, while ensuring that quality standards are achieved in the services provided.  The Group is also likely to deal with wider supports needed by recovering problem drug users in areas such as involvement in community employment schemes, educational supports and support with progression to employment, housing and childcare, while recognising the need to involve the families of problem drug users in the process.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the report, which will involve several Departments and Agencies, will be considered on its completion and it is envisaged that progress in that regard will be made in 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of comments of the Irish Association of Suicidology that binge drinking in particular, and illicit drug taking, are factors in the rising rate of suicide among young women.  While dealing with suicide is a matter for the Health Services Executive in the first instance, tackling the issue of illicit substance misuse among young people is a key element of the National Drugs Strategy 2001/08.</P>
        <P>Under the Strategy, a number of preventative measures have been put in place to address the issue of substance misuse among children, teenagers and young adults.  In respect of the education sector, the main focus of the National Drugs Strategy is on preventative strategies around the misuse of all substances.  Thus programmes have been developed targeting the primary and secondary school levels, as well as the informal education sector.  All schools now have substance misuse prevention programmes, namely the Walk Tall programme and the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, included on their curricula.  As a consequence of this, all students are being equipped with knowledge about the dangers of substance misuse.</P>
        <P>In my own Department, under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, over &euro;1.5 million has been allocated to a number of the major youth organisations to recruit Drugs Education Officers, or to put drugs education programmes in place.  The aim of the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund is to divert young people who are in danger of misusing drugs away from that path.  To date, over &euro;107 million has been allocated under the Fund to approximately 460 facility and services projects employing approximately 325 people.</P>

        <P>A series of awareness campaigns, focused particularly on young people and their parents, <Col N="1343"/>was undertaken in the three-year period from May 2003 to</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />raise awareness about drugs among the general population;</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am open to considering the issue of further such campaigns in association with the Health Service Executive, which is primarily responsible for such initiatives, and, as stated previously, for the issue of suicide.</P>

        <P el="5"><i>Community Development:</i></P>
        <P>In line with Towards 2016, an extra &euro;25m has been provided in additional support for the Community and Voluntary Sector in 2007 this represents an 8% increase for community affairs in the 2007 estimates.</P><Col N="1344"/>
        <P>&euro;25m for the Community and Voluntary Sector in 2007.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Highlights of the extra funding are:</i></P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of &euro;5m for Volunteering,</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;10m under the new Partnership Programme for supports for the Community &amp; Voluntary Sector</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />an increase in the Community Services Programme of &euro;10m on top of the extra &euro;5m already provided in 2006.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Community Services Programme provides employment and vital services to communities throughout the country.  This &euro;10m is part of an increase agreed in the Partnership talks, which will see this programme expand from its expenditure of &euro;37m in 2006 to &euro;72m at today&rsquo;s costs in 2009.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>LDSIP goes nationwide:</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">A major part of the Government policy has been the extension of the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme nationwide and a further &euro;7m has been provided for this purpose, bringing the total funding for this programme to be delivered through integrated local development agencies (incorporating Partnership companies) next year to &euro;81.5m.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Drugs:</i></P>
        <P>The Government are also continuing to provide increased funding for the Drugs Programme.   The funding provided for the Drugs Initiative &mdash; Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund  in 2007 is over &euro;43m which maintains the 36% increase on the 2005 estimate and is a dramatic increase on the &euro;14m allocated in 2002.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>RAPID:</i></P>
        <P>Continued funding has also been made available for the RAPID programme with the Leverage Fund, (for small capital projects in RAPID areas), now becoming an established part of the estimates process. The allocation for the Leverage schemes has increased from &euro;5.8m in 2004 when the schemes were introduced to &euro;9.3m in 2007</P>
        <P el="10"><i>&euro;43m for the Rural Social Scheme:</i></P>
        <P>Continued commitment to the Rural Social Scheme, which will involve an expenditure of over &euro;43m in 2007.  There are at present 2,600 people on the Rural Social Scheme and it is providing a range of comprehensive services in rural areas.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>&euro;20m for CL&Aacute;R:</i></P>
        <P>&euro;20m for the CL&Aacute;R programme under this programme for the development of areas that have sustained continuous loss in population since the foundation of the State.  The &euro;20m pro<Col N="1345"/>vided for, allied to funds it leverages from other Departments and agencies, will ensure &euro;50m approximately of investment in basic infrastructure in CL&Aacute;R areas including roads, water, community facilities, 3-phase electricity etc.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>&euro;31m for LEADER:</i></P>
        <P>&euro;26m has been provided for the LEADER 2000-2006 programme.  The bulk of this money is being provided for the payment of outstanding claims, and it includes &euro;6m for new actions under the current programme.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;5m has also been provided for the LEADER Rural Economy Sub-Programme 2007-2013 for the initial phases of this programme.  This programme will be three times larger than the current programme and it is hoped to have it in operation in the Spring or early Summer of 2007.  As is understandable, the lead-in time between first approval and payments is considerable with any of these programmes and the bulk of the expenditure under the LEADER Rural Economy Programme 2007-2013 will incur in later years of the programme.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>13% Increase in Current Funding for  the Western Development Commission:</i></P>
        <P>There is also provision in the Estimates for a 13% increase in current funding for the Western Development Commission and a further &euro;4m being invested in the Western Investment Fund.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that Waterways Ireland have produced a number of studies and reports in recent years on the possible restoration of the Ulster Canal. The latest reports were published in February 2006 and were welcomed by the then Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland, David Hanson, M.P., and myself at our meeting last March. We noted the potential these reports give for the canal to be developed and for boosting its social and economic potential.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, further work has been carried out in relation to the restoration and re-opening of the stretch of the Ulster Canal from Lough Erne to Clones, including proposals put forward by our Government. In light of this and in line with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s recent announcement, my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts <Col N="1348"/>and Leisure are now taking forward further work on these proposals.</P>

	<P>Following on from the evaluation of the confidential anti-drug dealing phone line established by Blanchardstown Local Drugs Task Force with funding provided by my Department, the Steering Group of the project proposed, as one of a number of recommendations, that the campaign be piloted nationwide.  The recommendations arising are being considered by the National Drugs Strategy Team and on receipt of their views I will consider the matter further.</P>
        <P>In considering the issue going forward I will be particularly interested in the views of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It may be the case that initiatives such as this have maximum impact when strongly targeted at specific local areas for defined short periods, rather than being rolled out generally with no specific time frame.</P>

	<P>I welcome the report &lsquo;A Community Drugs Study: Developing Community Indicators for Problem Drug Use&rsquo; as a contribution to the development of an appropriate set of community indicators that would reflect the changes in communities&rsquo; experience of drug related issues. The study related to issues raised in 2004 and to services provided in 1996&ndash;2002.  Further significant investment has been made by the Government since then, resulting in much increased service provision.</P>
        <P>The aim of the report was to garner the experiences of three communities, Bray, Crumlin and Ballymun, with respect to drugs issues and to derive proposals from this regarding indicators that, if developed, might facilitate the better monitoring of changes in drug issues in communities.</P>
        <P>Within the communities researched, it was heartening to see that so many improvements had been achieved, even at that stage, in regard to the expansion of drug treatment services, school leaving age, reduction in crime and improved employment figures over the period researched.  Having said that, the report also outlines concerns and fears within the communities regarding changing patterns in drug use, binge drinking, anti-social behaviour and violent drug related crime.</P>
        <P>The development of appropriate indicators is a difficult task and the National Advisory Commit<Col N="1351"/>tee on Drugs (NACD) is currently exploring with the relevant Departments and Agencies the issues involved, from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective, in developing such indicators and in establishing the extent to which these indicators would provide more timely and useful information than is already garnered through the consultative processes utilised through the National Drugs Strategy Framework.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may wish to refer to the priority question No. 40, which I answered earlier this afternoon.  In order to achieve its work programme, Comhairle na Tuaithe established separate working groups, which reported regularly to the full Comhairle, to address the three specific areas of its mandate.  The group that worked on the issue of access to the countryside, was chaired by my Department and comprised a representative of;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Comhar LEADER na h&Eacute;ireann</P>

     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the Mountaineering Council of Ireland</P>
        <P FLI="0">Through discussion, debate and co-operation they agreed a set of access parameters which Comhairle na Tuaithe formally endorsed and which it believes will act as a basis for conflict prevention and integrate a variety of needs and responsibilities.</P>
        <P>In its recent work on the formulation of the National Countryside Recreation these access parameters helped inform Comhairle na Tuaithe&rsquo;s discussion around the issue of access.  In its report on the strategy it made the following recommendations:</P>
        <P>That the Attorney General be requested to examine restating and/or reflecting in legislation the current common law position in relation to the protection of landowners&rsquo; property rights where recreational access is allowed on their land.</P>
        <P>That the Law Reform Commission be requested to make recommendations on the broader issues of access to the countryside for <Col N="1352"/>recreational users focussing on the constitutional and legal position pertaining in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe considered that no cost burden or liability, within the meaning of the Occupiers Liability Act, 1995, should attach to farmers/landowners as a result of allowing recreational users on their land.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe also recognised that farming organisations would continue to pursue direct compensation for access to land by recreational users of the countryside.</P>
        <P>I am concerned to ensure that these issues are addressed as a matter of priority, so to expedite matters I am establishing an expert group, comprising a Senior Counsel and officials from the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my own Department to urgently advise on tackling each of the legal issues raised.

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that last year Comhairle na Tuaithe agreed the key features necessary for countryside code development with a focus on the potential application of the internationally-recognised Leave No Trace initiative.  A branch of Leave No Trace has recently been established in Ireland and I am pleased to announce that my Department will be supporting that organisation by allocating &euro;30,000 towards the employment of a Strategic Co-ordinator. The Co-ordinator will be involved in actively promoting the Leave No Trace message among the many countryside recreation groups around the country.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland has already identified a selection of looped walks which it has publicised in its brochure &mdash; Walking Ireland &mdash; and on its website.  My Department in consultation with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Comhar LEADER na h&Eacute;ireann and  the National Waymarked Ways Advisory Committee are identifying further looped walks and waymarked ways for development.  Details will be made available over the coming weeks and months of the work required to bring these up to the best international standards.  I have set aside a further &euro;1.5 million for this purpose.</P>
        <P>I have reached agreement with F&aacute;ilte Ireland for the employment of up to 10 Walk Managers <Col N="1353"/>under the Community Services Programme to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks.</P>

Accordingly, it is expected that next year&rsquo;s funding demands for projects under this Programme will be significantly reduced. The AEV allocation to fund the Programme was considered in the context of the overall allocation for the Vote and, as with all spending programmes, expenditure will be kept under review by my Department during 2007. </P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that spending commitments certified in 2007 for projects arising under the Programme will be honoured.</P>

	<P>I recently received a copy of the report &ldquo;Harm Reduction Strategies and Young People in Blanchardstown&rdquo; prepared by the Blanchardstown Local Drug Task Force, which was launched <Col N="1354"/>by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health &amp; Children, while opening the Blanchardstown Drug Awareness week in November. </P>
        <P>The report proposes the use of harm reduction messages to young people at risk of polydrug use in the Blanchardstown area.  It then envisages building on existing services through developing a range of harm reduction measures and programmes, in conjunction with appropriate drug services and youth services, to minimise the negative consequences of drug use for the individual, the family and the community.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;60,000 for the provision of an education service to assist the implementation of the harm reduction strategy, building on existing preventative services, has been provided by my Department under the Emerging Needs Fund, bringing the total provided to Blanchardstown LDTF under that Fund to &euro;244,000.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Drugs Strategy is based on a &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; approach with Drug Task Forces, both Local and Regional, developing programmes of actions appropriate to their own areas of operation.  The rollout of an initiative such as the harm reduction strategy in Blanchardstown to other areas would depend on the degree of success of the initiative and whether other Drug Task Forces consider it to be an appropriate response to their problems regarding illicit drugs.  This can only be determined after the strategy has been implemented and subsequently evaluated.</P>

        <Quest> his views on whether it is pivotal to include specific renewable energy enterprise measures and targets in the list of sectoral niches that could address the issue of sustainable employment in rural areas as outlined in the draft Rural Development Plan 2007 to 2013. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Rural Ireland is particularly vulnerable to over-reliance on non-renewable energy sources because of the low density of the rural population and extended transport systems.  The challenge, therefore, will be to increase natural resource usage for energy production. Renewable energy production can create economically and environmentally sustainable enterprises and play an important role in the provision of employment in the coming years.  </P>
        <P>More specifically, initiatives at local level with regard to adapting new technologies can provide a meaningful contribution in securing energy supplies to rural communities. The main focus on renewable energy initiatives under the Rural Economy heading of the National Rural Development Programme, running from 2007 to 2013, will be on the development and adaptation <Col N="1355"/>of indigenous local natural resources to provide energy sources and options to local rural communities. The Leader methodology can play a significant role in this regard through the development of local awareness of the benefits of renewable energy &mdash; both to communities and to supporting small scale enterprises.</P>
        <P>Some funding will be available through local Leader partnerships to support analysis of local needs, matching these with the availability of renewable energy resources and providing some capital assistance to suitable community and enterprise-based projects.</P>

	<P>An amount of &euro;5m is being provided by my Department under the CL&Aacute;R Programme towards the development of the Western Rail Corridor. The funding is being provided towards essential clearance and preservation site works on the unused railway line between Claremorris and Collooney.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this work, which commenced in September last, is to re-establish the boundaries, prevent further deterioration of the line section and prevent any development that may otherwise impinge on the proposed detailed works required for the eventual reopening of the line. Specifically, the works include fencing, hedge cutting, renewal of level crossing gates as well as the provision of some essential drainage, removal of ivy and overgrowth from bridges and the provision of mile posts.</P>
        <P>I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that almost 50 miles of the corridor have been cleared to date.  I am happy that progress on the remaining part of the line is proceeding as planned and is in line with the budget and timescale set out initially.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These consultancies in the main related to the modernisation of the Civil Service, both as it relates to my Department and across the Civil Service generally.  These included for example Employee and Customer Surveys, Regulatory Reform initiatives etc.</P>
        <P>Consultants were also engaged to deal with aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU in 2004, as well as to provide expertise and advice on matters relating to the successful implementation of Social Partnership Agreements.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made by my Department to minimise expenditure on Consultancy Services. However, where it is necessary to engage consultants in order to avail of their particular expertise or experience, the procurement of consultancy services is subject to tendering procedures as laid down in Public Procurement Guidelines and, where applicable, EU procurement rules and guidelines.</P>
        <P>The procurement of consultancy services in my Department is subject to Public Procurement <Col N="1357"/>Guidelines from the Department of Finance as set out in &ldquo;Guidelines for Engagement of Consultants in the Civil Service &mdash; 1999&rdquo;.   Procurement of outside expertise in the public relations field is also subject to Public Procurement Guidelines as set out in the 2004 Department of Finance publication &ldquo;Public Procurement Guidelines &mdash; Competitive Process&rdquo;, which replaced the previous Department of Finance guidance entitled &ldquo;Public Procurement  &mdash; 1994 Edition (Green Book)&rdquo;.  In addition, the procurement of these services is also subject to applicable EU Procurement rules and guidelines.  There are also additional guidelines agreed by Government specifically for PR and communication type consultancies which are now incorporated into the Cabinet Handbook.</P>
        <P>The application of these guidelines requires that appropriate competitive procurement procedures are carried out in order to select the best service available, taking account of a number of important criteria including cost, the ability to undertake the work required and other relevant criteria, which may vary from project to project. This is an objective process, which results in selection of a provider, which should provide good value for money.</P>
        <P>Every effort is also made to reduce the cost of consultancy by providing, where possible, any administrative or other support from existing resources within the Department.  It is also our policy that skills-transfer from consultants to Departmental staff takes place as an integral part of all consultancy engagements.  The purpose of this is to increase the knowledge and expertise of Departmental staff and to reduce and, if possible, eliminate future dependance on consultants in the areas concerned.</P>
        <P>There are a number of safeguards in place which give assurance that value for money is obtained. These include:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Competitive selection processes in accordance with the Guidelines for engagement of consultants, which ensure that the most economically advantageous proposal is selected;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Monitoring of the work of consultants on a regular basis throughout the engagement and the use of appropriate project management techniques to ensure that the work is proceeding according to schedule;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Placing of Department staff to work on project teams alongside consultants to benefit from skills transfer;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Payment of fees according to the achievement of pre-agreed milestones; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Approval of expenditure on consultancy projects at the appropriate level depending on the scale and nature of each engagement.</P><Col N="1358"/>
        <P FLI="0">I am satisfied that these guidelines and procedures are followed in my Department and are fully reflected in the Department&rsquo;s internal procedures including the training provided to relevant staff.</P>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO established a dedicated Unit for this purpose.

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda&iacute; from Raheny and Clontarf Garda stations police the area referred to. The Garda&iacute; maintain regular contact <Col N="1361"/>with management of the premises referred to in order to address any public order issues which may arise. Additional Garda&iacute; are deployed in this area, particularly at weekends, and when events are being held.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that current policing plans in the area are predicated on the prevention of anti-social and public order offences, the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. Garda Units are directed to pay particular attention to areas where youths tend to congregate. This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area.</P>
        <P>Liaison is being maintained between Garda&iacute; and local residents and it is intended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will convene a meeting of relevant stakeholders in the near future to address all relevant issues arising in relation to the premises referred to.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area. The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area including the levels and patterns of anti-social behaviour such as the misuse of alcohol and drugs.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 on Thursday, 16 November, 2006, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength (all ranks) of the Carlow/Kildare Division as at 31 December, 1997 and as at 12 December, 2006 was 281 and 367 respectively. This represents an increase of 86 (or 30.6%) in the number of Garda personnel assigned to the Carlow/Kildare Division during that period.</P>
        <P>The personnel strength of each Garda Station in the Carlow/Kildare Division as at 31 December, 2001 and as 12 December, 2006 was as set out in the following table:</P>

        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel <Col N="1367"/>strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 on Thursday, 16 November, 2006, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>Local Garda Management report that Ballymahon Garda Station has not been downgraded. The personnel strength was augmented in May 2006 with the allocation of an additional Garda member to Ballymahon Garda Station.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that the personnel strength (all ranks) of Ballymahon Garda Station as at 12 December, 2006 was 4.  The personnel strength (all ranks) of Ballymahon Garda Station (by rank) from 1997 to the latest date for which figures are available was as set out in the following table:</P>

        <P>Garda management state that during each major event in Croke Park specific operational plans and additional policing measures, including additional traffic management and enforcement and public order patrols are put in place in the surrounding areas.

	<P>OPW has been requested by Mayo County Council to provide funding for flood relief works based on the report in question.</P>
        <P>It is understood the flooding in question affects the road and some gardens but that no residences or other buildings have been flooded.  OPW has a substantial and growing list of areas seeking flood relief where flooding of houses and other premises is causing hardship and priority is being accorded to such cases.</P>
        <P>The area in question falls within the Bleachyard Drainage District, which is part of the Camcloon Drainage District.  OPW believes that maintenance of the watercourse which is the responsibility of the Drainage District Board would considerably improve the situation in this case and will be advising the County Council accordingly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I announced in the Budget last Wednesday, the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers is being increased from &euro;4,000 per year in the case of a single person and &euro;8,000 per year in the case of married or widowed persons to &euro;8,000 and &euro;16,000, respectively, with effect from 1 January 2007.  This increased support will be available to all those currently in receipt of first-time buyers relief who are in the first seven years of their mortgage.  A &ldquo;first time buyer&rdquo; is an individual not previously entitled to relief in respect of interest paid on a loan used for the purchase or improvement of a sole or main residence.  </P>
        <P>Where, within the first seven years, a person switches his or her mortgage to benefit from a lower interest rate, he or she remains a first time buyer in respect of the remainder of the seven-year period which commenced on taking out the original loan.  Accordingly, in the question posed by the Deputy, the first time buyer stands to benefit from the increased relief for the remainder of this seven year period.  Of course, the extent to which such a person will be in a position to avail of the increased level of relief will depend on the extent to which interest arises on his or her mortgage.</P>
        <P>I might also mention to the Deputy that the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for non first-time buyers is also being increased to &euro;3,000 in <Col N="1375"/>the case of single person and to &euro;6,000 in the case of married or widowed persons.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Tax relief on individual pension contributions is allowed at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal tax rate, that is, at the standard or higher rate as appropriate in each case. It is assumed that the change mentioned by the Deputy is to provide tax relief at a rate of 41 per <Col N="1376"/>cent, assuming the enactment of the changes announced in the 2007 Budget, for all pension contributions by individuals, including those currently relieved at the standard rate.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to provide an estimate of the cost in income tax foregone of the higher rate of relief proposed by the Deputy in respect of employee contributions to occupational pension schemes because the relevant data in relation to contributions is not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling this information. Tax relief for pension contributions by employees is normally given by way of a deduction from total income in arriving at income for tax purposes i.e. the income for tax purposes of employees is net of their pension contributions (the &lsquo;net pay&rsquo; arrangement).</P>
        <P>Provisions were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers/ employers. The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers in February 2006 in respect of 2005. Work on developing the necessary technical enhancements to the Revenue computer system to enable this data to be captured is ongoing. This data will yield additional information regarding the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions but as the returns will be aggregated at employer level they will not provide a precise basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of proposals for change in the rate of relief at individual level such as that mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As regards the self-employed and certain employees in pensionable employment, there is data available in relation to relief on contributions for Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) for the income tax year 2003. RACs and PRSAs are subject to a current contribution cap of &euro;254,000. On that basis, the full year cost to the Exchequer of providing tax relief at 41 per cent in respect of contributions to RACs and PRSAs is tentatively estimated at about &euro;29 million in terms of income tax forgone, but could be considerably higher if the change resulted in new pension contributors claiming the relief.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.  It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services in these areas.   </P>
        <P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure for the effective functioning of the teams is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors. These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.</P>

	<P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 came into effect on 30 June 2006 and provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long term residential care who are alive and the estates of those wrongly charged and who have died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full together with an amount to take account of inflation.  The scheme covers those in contracted beds in private nursing homes and patients in receipt of in-patient services in community based facilities.</P>
        <P>Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.  It is only these charges which will be the subject of  repayment under the scheme.  Any other charges not covered by the Supreme Court decision of 16 February 2005 will not be repaid.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P><Col N="1380"/>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>

        <P>The World Health Organisation has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area and has indicated that exposure below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection in their 1998 Guidelines does not produce any known adverse health effects. These guidelines are based on a careful analysis of all peer-reviewed scientific literature including thermal and non-thermal effects. Telecommunication companies licensed to operate in Ireland are obliged to comply with these guidelines.  Research is ongoing in relation to this issue and my Department will continue to monitor developments concerning the possible health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy is the road map for the future development of primary care services in Ireland over a period of some ten years, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs, and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals.  At the heart of the Strategy is the aim of developing services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>The HSE received an additional &euro;10m in funding in 2006 to enable the establishment of up to 100 Primary Care Teams; a further &euro;13m is being provided in 2007 to enable the full year costs of these developments and of additional  GP co-operative services funded in 2006 to be met.  The HSE has indicated that it expects substantial progress in regard to the establishment of the Primary Care Teams to have been achieved by the end of the year.</P><Col N="1385"/>
        <P>I recently announced details of a further package of investment in Primary Care services in the context of Budget 2007. An additional &euro;20m has been committed for the development of  a further 100 new multi-disciplinary Primary Care Teams; &euro;12m of which will be provided in 2007, with the additional &euro;8m being provided in 2008 to enable the full year costs of these developments to be met. This funding is, of course, in addition to the very substantial resources already in the funding base for a wide range of primary care services.</P>
        <P>The new funding will enable the total number of Primary Care Teams to reach 200 thereby demonstrating the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the achievement of the objectives in Towards 2016 of establishing 300 Primary Care Teams by 2008; 400 by 2009; and 500 by 2011.</P>

	<P>A claim for Dublin weighting allowance for nurses and midwives was one of number of claims heard by the Labour Court on 20 June 2006. It was estimated that concession of this claim to nurses would have cost in excess of &euro;50m per annum. The Court issued its recommendation on 9 November 2006. The Court did not recommend concession of the claim for a Dublin weighting allowance.  I have no doubt that if a Dublin weighting allowance were to be conceded to nurses that all other health service grades would seek a similar allowance. I would also expect knock-on claims from the wider public service. It is estimated that providing a weighting allowance to all health service employees in Dublin would cost approximately &euro;144m per annum. If such an allowance were extended to other Dublin based public servants the estimated cost would increase to approximately &euro;252m per annum.</P>

	<P>A number of the recommendations contained in the Interim Report of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol concern a reduction in the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol advertising, marketing and sponsorship. In response to these, my Department entered into negotiations with the broadcasting, media and drinks industries while at the same time pursuing the development of legislation to restrict alcohol advertising, sponsorship and sales promotions / marketing practices. It was agreed that the industry would respond on an incremental basis. This has resulted in the establishment of Central Copy Clearance Ireland which addresses the issue of the content of advertisements, the development of a Voluntary Code of Practice on Advertising which addresses the issue of placement and the establishment of the Alcohol Marketing and Communications Monitoring Body to oversee the implementation of the Voluntary Code. </P>
        <P>The monitoring body is overseeing the implementation of and adherence to the Voluntary Codes of Practice. The Annual Report of the Monitoring Body is due to be completed in the Spring of 2007 and will be submitted to the Minister for Health and Children for consideration. Future actions in relation to legislation on this issue will be decided based on the findings of this report.  Breaches or suspected breaches of the Voluntary Code should be reported to the Chair of the Monitoring Body on Alcohol Advertising, Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, IPC House, 35/39 Shelbourne Road, Dublin 4.</P>

	<P>The assessment guidelines used by the Health <Col N="1388"/>Service Executive (HSE) in respect of applications for medical cards and GP visit cards are subject to review by the Executive and my Department from time to time, having regard to the need to ensure that persons intended to benefit under these arrangements can do so.  Such reviews have regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes which may be made to the various social welfare schemes.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. In 2005 the income guidelines were increased incrementally by a cumulative 29%.  Other significant changes which I have introduced are that applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and that allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work.   In June 2006 I agreed with the Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  The table gives details of Medical Card and GP Visit Card income guidelines as at 11 December, 2006.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.  It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services in these areas.</P>
        <P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure for the effective functioning of the teams is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors. These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Out of hours co-operatives allow general practitioners to put in place arrangements to provide services to their patients, while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, on weekends and bank holidays. The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people&rsquo;s care needs are met in the primary care setting.  Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties. Between 2000 and 2005 approximately &euro;105 million was allocated to the HSE for out of hours GP co-operatives and in 2006 almost &euro;34 million is available to the Executive for these services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 to 185, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="1392"/>
        <P>Parents for Justice wrote to me on 21st November last to request a meeting but due to pressure of business I am unable to accede to their request at this time. However I have informed the organisation that my officials will be happy to meet them and discuss the issues of concern to them.</P>
        <P>When Ms Anne Dunne SC presented her report on post-mortem practice to me in March 2005, I was advised by the Attorney General that it could not be published for legal and natural justice reasons. Some sections of the report were released on 18 July last in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Acts from Parents for Justice.  However, in the light of the legal advice available to me, I have no plans to publish the full report, nor do I believe there is anything to be gained from the establishment of a Statutory Inquiry.</P>
        <P>Dr. Deirdre Madden, a distinguished expert on medical law, was appointed by Government in May 2005 to provide a report on key issues relating to post-mortem practice and procedures and her report on Post-Mortem Practice and Procedures was published on 18 January this year.   Considerable progress has already been made by the Health Service Executive in implementing the recommendations of the Madden Report in hospitals across the country and my officials will continue to liaise with the Executive to monitor progress in this regard.</P>
        <P>A key recommendation of the report was that a Working Group be established to examine issues not included in the original terms of reference, that is post-mortem issues relating to babies who died before or during birth, minors and adults. This Group, chaired by Dr. Madden, was set up in March, 2006 and its membership included representatives of Parents For Justice and the Irish Stillbirth and Neo-natal Death Society, together with healthcare professionals from a range of disciplines. I published the Report from the Working Group on 7th November last.</P>
        <P>Both Reports stressed the need for legislation to be introduced to ensure that no post-mortem examination will be carried out and no tissue or organ retained from a post-mortem examination for any purpose without appropriate authorisation. I have asked my Department to prepare proposals for consideration by Government in relation to the legislation required to give effect to these recommendations.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy which is committed to providing some &euro;900m over the period 2005-2009, &euro;41 million has been provided in the 2007 budget for the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.  This funding will provide 255 new residential places; 85 new respite places and 535 new day places.  A similar number of extra places were provided during 2006 as part of a programme to develop key services and meet emerging needs.  The funding includes &euro;2.2m for the transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from settings which are inappropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question also relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The health services are undergoing a period of major change and reform.  The National Health Strategy, the Primary Care Strategy as well as the Prospectus, Brennan and Hanly Reports lay out the overall direction for the major changes which are now under way.  Government policy is to provide safe, high-quality and accessible services <Col N="1394"/>that provide the best possible outcomes for patients and which represent good value for the resources available.  This will mean rebalancing service delivery so that those services that can be safely delivered locally are delivered locally and in the most appropriate setting. The Primary Care Strategy provides the road map for the future development of primary care services in Ireland over a period of some 10 years, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs, and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has informed my Department that the following additional in-patient beds and day treatment places are due to be brought into use in 2007:</P>
        <P LI="1">Midland Hospital Tullamore &mdash; 27 in-patient beds and 30 day treatment places in the new hospital</P>
        <P LI="1">Wexford General Hospital &mdash; 19 in-patient beds</P>
        <P LI="1">St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Elm Park &mdash; 12 day treatment places and 4 intensive care beds</P>
        <P LI="1">Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin &mdash; 7 oncology day treatment places</P>
        <P LI="1">University College Hospital Galway &mdash;  3 in-patient beds in the new burns unit.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, the HSE is fast-tracking the provision of admission units to alleviate pressures in a number of A &amp; E departments.  Admission lounges have been developed at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital (15 beds), Connolly Memorial Hospital (8 beds), St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital (20 beds), Tallaght Hospital (40 beds), Cork University Hospital (10 beds) and the Mercy Hospital in Cork (4 beds).  These admissions lounges enable patients awaiting admission to an acute hospital bed to be managed safely while preserving their right to dignity and privacy.  Further admission lounges are scheduled to come on-stream in 2007.</P>
        <P>A Steering Group under the chairmanship of the National Director of the National Hospitals Office is reviewing our acute hospital bed requirements  up to the year 2020.   The Group includes representatives of the Health Service Executive, my Department, the Department of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190, 192 and 193 together.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Act 2001 provides a modern framework within which people who have a mental disorder and require treatment or protection can be cared for and treated.  It puts in place mechanisms by which the standards, care and treatment in mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated.</P>
        <P>Sections 1 to 5, 7 and 31 to 55 of the Mental Health Act 2001 were commenced in April 2002.  These involved the establishment of the Mental Health Commission to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services and to protect the interests of people detained under the 2001 Act.  It also provided for the establishment of the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services (replacing the former Inspector of Mental Hospitals).</P>
        <P>The remaining provisions of the Act were commenced on 1 November 2006.  This included the establishment of Mental Health Tribunals, under <Col N="1396"/>the auspices of the Mental Health Commission.  The Tribunals will conduct a review of each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient on an involuntary basis or to extend the duration of such detention.  The review will be independent, automatic and must be completed within 21 days of the detention/extension order being signed.  This brings Irish mental health legislation into line with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
        <P>My Department, the HSE and the Mental Health Commission worked closely together to ensure the successful implementation of the Act.  The Health Service Executive established a National Steering Group supported by a Liaison Team to prepare for the full implementation of Act.  These groups worked closely with mental health service managers, clinicians and service users to ensure the smooth transition to the legislative environment.  The HSE also convened a Working Group to develop a proposal for a framework to ensure that second opinions would be sought in a demonstrably independent fashion.</P>
        <P>Over &euro;2.2m was provided for staff training and provided intensive and accredited programmes for over 5,000 staff on the Mental Health Act.  Tribunal rooms were prepared and equipped in all acute Admission Units and additional Consultant led teams are being recruited.  The Mental Health Commission provided extensive training to staff in the mental health services and produced a number of reference guides to the  Act which are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website at <i>www.mhcirl.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Regulations setting out minimum standards for centres in relation to the care of residents and the provision of adequate and suitable accommodation were introduced from 1 November 2006.  Compliance with these regulations will be monitored by the Inspector of Mental Health Services.  Regulations in relation to authorised officers took effect from 1 November 2006.  For the purposes of Section 9 of the Mental Health Act 2001 the rank and grade of &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; is prescribed as Local Health Manager, General Manager, Grade VIII, Psychiatric Nurse, Occupational Therapist, Psychologist or Social Worker.</P>
        <P>Under the Mental Health Act 2001, the HSE is obliged to provide an assisted admission service.  Where an assisted admission is required, the Approved Centre seeks to establish an Assisted Admissions team from its own staff in the first instance.  If this is not possible, the Approved Centre contacts the External Contractor to provide the service.  My Department has been informed by the HSE that this arrangement has been working well and is being kept under ongoing review.</P>
        <P>In addition, guidance has been provided by the Commission on the following areas:</P><Col N="1397"/>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Involuntary Admission Procedures for Adults</P>

        <P>Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy entitled &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; was launched on 24th January 2006.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.  &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; provides a framework for action to develop a modern high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.   In 2006, a sum of  &euro;26.2 million was provided for the development of our mental health services in line with &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;. A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated for 2007 to continue this development.</P>
        <P>In March 2006,  I appointed an independent monitoring group to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;.  The group will monitor and assess progress on the implementation of all the recommendations including those which fall under the responsibility of the HSE, government departments and other relevant agencies.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the recommendations in &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE recently established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; a reality.  Both of these groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.</P>

        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. This also includes responsibility for the planning and management of capital projects in the health sector, including the development(s) referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have all the matters raised by the Deputy investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, under the current Regulations, when considering an application for subvention, the Health Service Executive carries out a means test which takes into account the means (including assets) of the applicant and his or her spouse/ cohabiting partner, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>Under Paragraph 13 of the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993, the HSE  may impute an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, regardless of market value, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or son or daughter aged less than twenty one years or in full time education or in receipt of certain social welfare pensions/ allowances/benefits, and generally does so unless there are exceptional circumstances. The Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill 2006 provides that the same categories of people are protected.  The Bill also contains a new provision that gives the HSE discretion not to impute where doing so could lead to the destitution or homelessness of a person closely linked to the applicant.  This Bill was prepared on a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; basis.</P>
        <P>A new scheme to support the financing of Long Term Residential Care was launched on 11 December 2006.

        <P>Since May 2005, Mr. Carriles has been detained in US custody, charged with illegally entering US territory. The US Government has decided not to grant the extradition requests for Mr. Carriles submitted by the Venezuelan and Cuban authorities; it is my understanding that this U.S. decision is based on the principle of non-refoulement. This principle, which is contained in Article 3.1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture, requires States not to expel, return (&ldquo;refouler&rdquo;) or extradite persons to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing <Col N="1408"/>that they would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 224 together.</P>
        <P>On being contacted by a member of the family, I have taken a close personal interest in the case concerning the removal of the internal organs of an Irish citizen who had died in Bulgaria. I am also deeply conscious of the distress suffered by this family.</P>
        <P>On learning of the case, I immediately instructed our Embassy in Sofia to raise the issue with the Bulgarian authorities to establish the reasons for the removal of the organs, and to secure their release and return to the family. I also instructed that the issue be raised with our partners at EU level, through the Consular Affairs Working Group.</P>
        <P>As a result of our initiative, a working group of EU countries was mandated to look at repatriation of remains from Bulgaria. It was clear from <Col N="1409"/>the discussions at EU level that some other countries, including the UK and the Nordic countries, were experiencing similar problems.</P>
        <P>On 10 October of this year, following sustained efforts by the Embassy in Sofia, the Regional Prosecutor in Varna informed the Embassy that the investigation into the death had concluded, and that the hospital in Varna had been ordered to ensure that the remaining organs were preserved properly in preparation for release and transportation. The organs were subsequently returned to the family on 1 November.</P>
        <P>On 22 November, the Bulgarian Minister for Health informed our Embassy that he had drafted an ordinance that would ensure that in future all organs are repatriated with the body following autopsy. I very much welcome this response to the initiatives we have taken, supported by our EU colleagues.</P>

	<P>These events were the subject of extensive investigation by an independent Commission of Inquiry headed by Justice Barron. That Commission presented four separate reports to the Taoiseach and a Sub-Committee of the Oireachtas has considered each of them in turn. The reports of the Sub-Committee highlight issues of deep concern. On foot of the first of these reports, the Government appointed Mr. Patrick MacEntee S.C. as Sole Member of a Commission of Investigation to examine specific matters relating to the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings of 1974. This Commission of Investigation is in the closing stages of its work. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has made the issue of collusion a continual feature of our contacts with the British Government at all levels. The Taoiseach discussed the issue when he met with Prime Minister Blair in London on 4 December last. I also had a follow-up discussion with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting in London yesterday, during which I received a promise of full cooperation by the British Government in addressing this issue. We will continue to press the British Government on these matters in order to achieve progress on these very disturbing cases.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and I have already announced our support for a full debate in the D&aacute;il and <Col N="1410"/>Seanad on collusion, as recommended by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. I look forward to that debate and to the opportunity it will give for the various issues of concern to be further considered in this House.</P>

	<P>My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and F&Aacute;S, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.</P>
        <P>The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provide support to micro-enterprises with 10 employees or fewer.  The function of the CEBs is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants or for non-financial support such as business advice and information, management development, training and mentoring.</P>
        <P>All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of new and existing enterprises by individuals, firms and community groups provided that the projects, that should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.  In this regard, therefore, funding is unlikely to be avail<Col N="1413"/>able towards the costs of extending a garden centre or nursery business.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for Enterprise Ireland assistance client companies must be Irish owned, be a manufacturing or an internationally trading services enterprise or be an overseas company in the food, drink and timber sectors seeking assistance to locate in Ireland, must employ more than 10 people or be a high growth start-up according to criteria defined by the Board of Enterprise Ireland.

	<P>According to the most recent Quarterly National Household Survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 30 November, the numbers in employment in the Mid-East region, of which Naas is a part, continue to grow.  The numbers increased from 225,600 people in the second quarter of 2006 to 231,800 in the third quarter.  This represents a continuing strong rise of over 20,000 in the number of people in employment in the region over the last two years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years, a number of world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Wyeth Medica and Hewlett Packard have been attracted to County Kildare.  As regards Naas itself, in May of this year, I announced a major investment of &euro;28m by Dawn Farm Foods Ltd with support from Enterprise Ireland.  A total of 100 new jobs will be created.  A major expansion by Green Isle Foods is under way and on target.  The Millennium Park in the town has three modern advance office buildings available for marketing to investors.  A financial services company has already established in the Park.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the efforts of the Industrial Development agencies will continue to attract investment and job opportunities to the area.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. Since 1996, the Agency has been disposing of its landlord&rsquo;s interest in buildings throughout the country. This policy was reviewed as part of the 2004 expenditure review of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s property portfolio and the Steering Group was satisfied that the approach, which seeks to have the provision of buildings funded by the private sector, is appropriate.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by IDA Ireland that the last remaining IDA advance unit in county Kildare, which is located in Athy, is now occupied and negotiation is ongoing regarding the purchase of the unit by an Irish company.</P>
        <P>In addition, IDA has sites in Kildare Town, Monasterevin and Castledermot that are available for industrial promotion.  In the past 12 months two companies visited Kildare; one in food processing and the other one in financial services. Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate are taken by investors themselves and IDA will continue to promote these sites.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland strategy for the County is to:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Progress development in the area towards a knowledge economy in order that the County can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Encourage increased cooperation between foreign direct investment companies and the third level institutions in the County e.g. University College Maynooth;</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Work with the existing client base in the County to expand their presence.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am satisfied that the strategy which IDA Ireland has adopted and put in place for the County is delivering results in terms of additional jobs for the people of Kildare. In the period 1996 to 2005, the permanent jobs base in IDA overseas companies in the County has risen from 6,797 to 10,818, an increase of 4,021 jobs.</P>

	<P>Child benefit in the Irish welfare system is a universal child income support payment which is payable in respect of qualified children up to the age of 16 years or up to 19 years if the child is in full-time education.  It should be noted that Irish child benefit rates compare favourably with UK child benefits.  In the year 2007-2008 the rate of payment in the UK will be the equivalent of &euro;115.99 per month for the first child and &euro;77.54 for subsequent children whereas increases announced in Budget 2007 will bring the Irish rate to &euro;160 for each of the first two children and &euro;195 for subsequent children.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to expand child benefit in the manner proposed.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the circumstances of the case to which the Deputy refers and of the complaint recently lodged with the Public Service Ombudsman and previously investigated by the Pensions Ombudsman. The case has also been discussed before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs. The case relates to a provision of section 48(3) of the Pensions Act 1990, which enables the trustees of a pension scheme in wind-up to make a transfer payment to another occupational pension scheme without the consent of the members rather than to purchase an annuity on behalf of the retired members.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.6- ?>
        <P>My Department has responded to enquiries received from one of the retired members of the scheme in question and to representations made on his behalf.  The scheme member has expressed dissatisfaction with the action taken by the trustees of the executive pension plan to secure his benefits after deciding to wind up the scheme in July 2002.</P><Col N="1463"/>
        <P>The trustees chose to exercise their right under section 48 (3) of the Pensions Act 1990 to transfer his membership and the payment of his pension to the staff pension scheme. The Pensions Board advised the scheme member on a number of occasions that it is satisfied that the trustees acted in accordance with the provisions of the Act in discharging the liabilities of the scheme in wind-up. I understand that to date no financial loss has been suffered by any of the retired members of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Under current actuarial guidance, which entered into force after the particular executive scheme was wound up, the full actuarial cost of purchasing an annuity on behalf of pensioners of a scheme in wind up must now be transferred to the new scheme.</P>
        <P>Arising from this case the Pensions Board conducted a review of section 48(3) of the Pensions Act. It is considered that this section should be amended to require advance disclosure by trustees to scheme members, of their intention to wind up a scheme and to make a transfer payment to another pension scheme. While there has been no evidence of any widespread abuse of this particular provision of the Pensions Act, I.will examine its operation further, taking account of the views of the Pensions Board and the Pensions Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The next opportunity to make an amendment to the Pensions Act, if required, will be by way of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, due to be published in early 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 244 together.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to provide an accurate cost of an increase of &euro;100 per week in the level of rent limits or of a 50% increase in the rent limits due to the unquantifiable impact of such increases on general market rent levels. However, as an indicative guide by reference to the number of rent supplement claims currently in payment, a &euro;100 increase in weekly rent supplement could add some &euro;312 million to scheme costs in a full year, while a general 50% increase in rent supplement limits could cost some &euro;198 million.</P><Col N="1464"/>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>My Department is currently reviewing levels of rent limits in order to develop proposals regarding what limits should apply from January 2007 onwards. The review is taking account of prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, together with detailed input from the Health Service Executive on the market situation within each of its operational areas.</P>
        <P>The review will also include consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board. In addition, a number of the voluntary agencies working in this area have made detailed submissions.  This process will ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</P>
        <P>Increases of &euro;100 per week in the level of rent limits or 50% increases of the rent limits would be both unrealistic and unjustified in terms of the current rental market.  Given the significant share of the private rented accommodation that is occupied by households receiving rent supplement, any such increases would have a major distorting effect on rent levels charged, not just for rent supplement recipients but for all tenants.  There would be a very significant increase in rent supplement expenditure, with no net financial gain accruing to the people who rely on the scheme for their accommodation needs.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to accommodate those entitled to free travel but who do not live near a bus or train route; his views on issuing travel vouchers which could be used in taxis to people in this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[43048/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas, including those in the Rural Transport Initiative.  I am <Col N="1465"/>always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined. A study, &ldquo;A Review of the Free Schemes,&rdquo; published in 2000 under the Department&rsquo;s programme of expenditure reviews concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel.  This position remains unchanged.</P>
        <P>The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the Rural Transport Initiative, which is being managed by Pobal, formerly Area Development Management (ADM) on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. My Department contributed &euro;500,000 to the initiative in 2004, &euro;750,000 in 2005 and is contributing &euro;850,000 for the initiative in 2006, to ensure that free travel passholders continue to have access to community based transport services.</P>
        <P>I will continue to review the operation of the free travel scheme with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if he has plans to treat women who have worked only in the home as being independent of their spouse when being assessed for the State non-contributory pension; his views on whether using their husband&rsquo;s income when assessing their means compounds the sacrifice made be women in this situation who have given up their own careers to look after their families; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The social welfare system comprises two types of payment, social insurance based schemes, which require those eligible to reach a certain standard in terms of the social insurance contributions paid or credited on their record, and non-contributory payments designed for those without the necessary social insurance record for contributory schemes who can satisfy a means test. Within that basic structure the Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible, particularly women, can qualify for a pension in their own right and a number of measures are in place to support this objective.</P>
        <P>The state pension (non-contributory) is a social assistance scheme and, in common with all other such schemes, features a means test. In assessing eligibility for social assistance payments, the means test is based on household income. This is to ensure that resources committed to social <Col N="1466"/>assistance payments are used to provide support and improve the position of those who are most in need.</P>
        <P>However, as already indicated, I am anxious to see as many as possible qualifying for payments in their own right and improvements have been made to the means test in pursuit of this objective. The new enhanced state pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years, which I introduced at the end of September, features significant improvements in the means test which will allow some who are currently outside the social welfare pensions system to qualify for a payment. Further improvements were made to the means test in last week&rsquo;s Budget by increasing the means disregard by &euro;10 to &euro;30 per week. In addition, I increased the employment earnings disregard by &euro;100 to &euro;200 per week. Both of these disregards are doubled for pensioner couples.</P>
        <P>With regard to pensions generally, the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the new social partnership agreement Towards 2016 with a view to developing a framework for future pensions policy. This will deal with pensions in general but it will also address outstanding issues relating to social welfare pensions, including the position of those who remain outside the system. The Green Paper will be published within months. A consultation process will then take place and the Government will subsequently publish a framework for future pensions policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 340,000 pensioner and other households qualify for the electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package. In recognition of the recent increases in the price of natural gas and electricity, I have recently announced significant increases to the gas and electricity allowances.</P>
        <P>In order to cover the 33.8% increase in the cost of natural gas, from October 1st, I increased the value of the natural gas allowance to cover increased standing charges and the associated VAT as well as additional kilowatt hours usage. This means that the value of the natural gas allowance to a household has increased from &euro;313.17 to &euro;516 per year.</P>
        <P>At present, the electricity allowance covers normal standing charges and up to 1,800 units of electricity. The allowance also covers the VAT applicable to these charges. In the light of the recent increase in electricity charges, the allowance will be increased to cover increased standing charges and the units will also increase from 1,800 <Col N="1467"/>to 2,400 with effect from January 2007. I am confident that these increases will be of major benefit to these recipients.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>In addition to the electricity and gas allowance my Department also pays a fuel allowance for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April to assist householders on long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. In Budget 2006, I provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of &euro;5, from &euro;9 per week to &euro;14 per week and to &euro;17.90 in designated smokeless areas. In Budget 2007 I have provided for a further increase of &euro;4 per week to &euro;18. This means that the level of the fuel allowance will have doubled in the last two years and can be used for any form of heating fuel. I have also increased the income threshold for eligibility for fuel allowance from &euro;51 to &euro;100 per week over and above the contributory pension to enable more people to qualify for the payment. In Budget 2007 my colleague the Minister for Finance also followed through on his commitment to reduce the excise duty on Kerosene and LPG for heating purposes to zero from next month.</P>

        <P>Under EU regulation 1408/71, an employed person who is working in a Member State is entitled to family benefits provided by that State even though the worker&rsquo;s family may be residing in another member state.</P>
        <P>Claims processed under EU regulations generally take a longer time to finalise due to the need to communicate with the parent or carer of the child(ren) in the other member state, and also the need to communicate separately with the authorities in the other member state. It is necessary to obtain relevant birth certificates along with confirmation of the worker&rsquo;s employment in this country.</P>
        <P>In the case of persons from non-English speaking countries further delays and complexities can arise due to the language barriers involved.</P>
        <P>The volume of claims to be processed under EU regulations has increased significantly over the last two years &mdash; in 2005 the weekly average intake of such claims was 30 whereas in 2006 the average intake was 300. These volumes have also put pressure on resources in the claim processing area.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently examining measures to streamline and speed up the pro<Col N="1468"/>cessing of claims under EU regulations, including overtime working and increasing the numbers of staff involved in dealing with such applications.</P>
        <P>My Department has also engaged, on a trial basis, a small number of clerical staff who are fluent in EU languages other than English. This trial has proven successful to date and the outcome is being reviewed to see how such staff could best be deployed.</P>

These &ldquo;Rules of Behaviour&rdquo; ensure that Illness Benefit is paid only to people who are unable to work because of illness or disability.

	<P>From January 2007 persons in receipt of state pension (non contributory) can also augment their income by up to &euro;200 per week (or &euro;10,400 annually) in earnings from insurable employment and still maintain their pension entitlements in addition to their entitlement to fuel allowance. This new disregard, relating to earnings from employment, is an incentive to facilitate state pension (non-contributory) recipients who wish to continue working or to re-enter the workforce. This income limit was increased to &euro;200 per week in Budget 2007.</P>
        <P>Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to means and other conditions.  The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with a qualifying dependant.</P>
        <P>People who qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as state pension (non-<Col N="1470"/>contributory), long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance.  The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment. This ensures that people who avail of the disregard incentive on their own state pension (Non-Contributory) to take up employment worth EUR 200 per week do not lose fuel allowance.</P>
        <P>In the case of recipients of contributory pensions, any earnings from insurable employment and/or occupational pensions are normally regarded as means for the purpose of determining an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to a fuel allowance.  From January 2007 a person may have a combined household income of up to &euro;100 per week, or savings/investments of up to &euro;58,000, over and above the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) and still qualify for fuel allowance.  This income limit was increased to &euro;100 per week in Budget 2007.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2007, I have also provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of &euro;4 from &euro;14 to &euro;18 (&euro;21.90 in designated smokeless areas) in addition to the increase in the income thresholds.</P>

	<P>The Rural Transport Initiative (RTI) was launched on a pilot basis in 2002.  Under this scheme, thirty-four community transport groups throughout the country are being funded to address the particular transport needs of their rural areas. Pobal administers the scheme on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>The pilot phase of the Initiative will conclude at the end of this year and in line with Government announcements in the matter, preparations are now being made to mainstream the provision of rural transport from 2007 onwards. This work is based on the experience with the pilot RTI and the outcome of a recent public consultation process in the matter.</P>
        <P>In line with commitments in Towards 2016 and in parallel with the implementation of Transport 21, Euro 9 million is being provided for the RTI in 2007. This funding will facilitate the transition of the RTI from the end of its pilot phase into the beginning of the mainstreaming process. In making specific allocations to the individual RTI project groups from this funding, I expect Pobal <Col N="1471"/>to work closely with the existing groups to maximise the impact of the funding through, among other things, increased service provision and wider area coverage as well as ensuring continued value for money.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 261 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware my Department administers and delivers a wide range of programmes and measures targeted at social or economic deprivation in either rural or urban areas and at community development, both local and national. For details regarding these programmes and measures and the criteria for funding, I would refer the Deputy to the information on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy has a specific question in relation to any scheme or programme, I will be happy to assist him.  The schemes and programmes are developed and refined to meet new or changing needs as required and, again, if the Deputy has a specific concern in this regard, I will be happy to assist him.</P>
        <P>The following is a summary of the main increases in funding for my Department&rsquo;s schemes and programmes relevant to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions as provided in the recently published Abridged Estimates Volume for 2007.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Extracts from statements on the Estimates</i></P>
        <P el="5"><i>Community Development</i></P>
        <P>In line with Towards 2016, an extra &euro;25m has been provided in additional support for the Community and Voluntary Sector in 2007 this represents an 8% increase for community affairs in the 2007 estimates.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>&euro;25m for the Community and Voluntary Sector in 2007.</i></P>
        <P>Highlights of the extra funding are:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of &euro;5m for Volunteering,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;10m under the new Partnership Programme for supports for the Community &amp; Voluntary Sector</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />an increase in the Community Services Programme of &euro;10m on top of the extra &euro;5m already provided in 2006.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Community Services Programme provides employment and vital services to communities throughout the country.  This &euro;10m is part of an increase agreed in the Partnership talks, which will see this programme expand from its expenditure of &euro;37m in 2006 to &euro;72m at today&rsquo;s costs in 2009.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>LDSIP goes nationwide</i></P>
        <P>A major part of the Government policy has been the extension of the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme nationwide and a <Col N="1474"/>further &euro;7m has been provided for this purpose, bringing the total funding from for this programme to be delivered through integrated local development agencies (incorporating Partnership companies) next year to &euro;81.5m.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Drugs</i></P>
        <P>The Government are also continuing to provide increased funding for the Drugs Programme.   The funding provided for the Drugs Initiative &mdash; Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund  in 2007 is over &euro;43m which maintains the 36% increase on the 2005 estimate and is a dramatic increase on the &euro;14m allocated in 2002.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>RAPID</i></P>
        <P>Continued funding has also been made available for the RAPID programme with the Leverage Fund (for small capital projects in RAPID areas), now becoming an established part of the estimates process. The allocation for the Leverage schemes has increased from &euro;5.8m in 2004 when the schemes were introduced to &euro;9.3m in 2007.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>&euro;43m for the Rural Social Scheme</i></P>
        <P>Continued commitment to the Rural Social Scheme, which will involve an expenditure of over &euro;43m in 2007.  There are at present 2,600 people on the Rural Social Scheme and it is providing a range of comprehensive services in rural areas.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>&euro;20m for CL&Aacute;R</i></P>
        <P>&euro;20m for the CL&Aacute;R programme under this programme for the development of areas that have sustained continuous loss in population since the foundation of the State.  The &euro;20m provided for, allied to funds it leverages from other Departments and agencies, will ensure &euro;50m approximately of investment in basic infrastructure in CL&Aacute;R areas including roads, water, community facilities, 3-phase electricity etc.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>&euro;31m for LEADER</i></P>
        <P>&euro;26m has been provided for the LEADER 2000-2006 programme.  The bulk of this money is being provided for the payment of outstanding claims, and it includes &euro;6m for new actions under the current programme.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;5m has also been provided for the LEADER Rural Economy Sub-Programme 2007-2013 for the initial phases of this programme.  This programme will be three times larger than the current programme and it is hoped to have it in operation in the Spring or early Summer of 2007.  As is understandable, the lead-in time between first approval and payments is considerable with any of these programmes and the bulk of the expenditure under the LEADER Rural Economy Programme 2007-2013 will incur in later years of the programme.</P><Col N="1475"/>
        <P el="10"><i>13% Increase in Current Funding for  the Western Development Commission</i></P>
        <P>There is also provision in the Estimates for a 13% increase in current funding for the Western Development Commission and a further &euro;4m being invested in the Western Investment Fund.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>18% increase for Social and Cultural Schemes in the Gaeltacht</i></P>
        <P>The funding available for 2007 for social and cultural schemes in the Gaeltacht has been increased by 18%.  This provision has increased from &euro;8.35m in 2006 to &euro;9.85m in 2007.  Payments are made to &ldquo;mn&aacute; t&iacute;&rdquo; under Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge from this fund.  This fund also provides for language planning, various cultural schemes, language assistants and third level education in the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>27% increase in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s  current expenditure fund for Gaeltacht projects</i></P>
        <P>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s current expenditure fund for Gaeltacht initiatives is to be increased by &euro;1m (27%).  This fund provides for payments to co-operatives, community based organisations, youth clubs and other cultural services throughout the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>&euro;50m of capital funding for the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and Islands</i></P>
        <P>Almost &euro;50m of capital funding, i.e. funding invested in piers, roads, island infrastructure, village enhancement and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s capital provision, has been provided for 2007.</P>

        <P>In the current year across the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas, 361 projects, including those under the Emerging Needs Fund, are receiving interim funding totalling &euro;20.2m from my Department.  Of these, 191 projects deal with the issues of treatment and rehabilitation, with a total value of over &euro;13m.</P>
        <P>I have also allocated &euro;5m in 2006 to the ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) to facilitate the initiation of the implementation of their action plans.

The Deputy will also be aware that expenditure under these programme areas takes place across a wide range of schemes and projects countrywide, descriptions of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.  It is not possible to give a county by county breakdown as many schemes operate across county boundaries.</P>

	<P>To date &euro;120m has been allocated from the Dormant Accounts Fund in the period 2003-2006. The level of expenditure and the priorities to be supported from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2007 are currently under consideration.  In this regard, the legislation requires the Minister to consult other appropriate Ministers for the purpose of developing a proposal for submission to Government for approval.  This process is almost complete and the intention is to submit a proposal to Government in January concerning the 2007 round of funding. The level of expenditure in 2008 and beyond will be decided with reference to the value of the Fund and estimated inflows on an annual basis.</P>

	<P>My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme.  It is a matter for each Department to respond to issues of increased funding within their area of responsibility. I introduced the Leverage Schemes in 2004.  My Department directly funds schemes to provide playgrounds, improve traffic measures, improve health facilities, provide CCTV, support sporting organisations as well as improve local authority housing estates and flat complexes.  All funds are matched by funding from other Departments and Agencies.  The schemes are aimed at small-scale capital works &mdash; works that require relatively small amounts of funding but can produce real and concrete benefits to communities. Since the introduction of these Schemes I have increased the amount of money allocated annually from some &euro;6.5m in 2004 to some &euro;11.0m in 2006.  Drawdown of the funds takes place when works are completed and not necessarily in the year of allocation.  The timing of completion of works is obviously outside of the control of my Department. I am satisfied that the provision in the Abridged Estimates Volume for 2007 will enable me to maintain this level of commitment. I am constantly reviewing the Schemes available to ensure that they are serving the needs of the RAPID communities.  I have this year amended the Playground Scheme to allow <Col N="1479"/>provision of MUGAs (Multi-User Games Areas) which has proved very popular.  I am actively considering a number of other Leverage Schemes and I will publish full details of these Schemes when these are launched.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category C.</P>
        <P>Category C caters for farmers who sold their milk quota into the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</P>
        <P>The father of the person named sold his milk quota in April 2004 and ceased farming.  He leased his farm and any associated Single Payment entitlements to the person named in March 2004.  As the person named was neither an active milk producer nor the owner of a milk quota he did not therefore satisfy the criteria for Category C.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted an appeal against this decision and provided additional documentation in support of his appeal. In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision. In this case the documentation was examined by my Department but did not provide grounds for a change to the original decision. This case has since been forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who will carry out a full review of the case and will correspond directly with the person named following the outcome of their review.</P>
        <P>However, we note that the person named leased land in 2004 and in the 2006 National Reserve there is provision for New Entrants to farming who have leased land.  This category (category B) caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who, while farming during 2002, did not receive any direct payments in respect of that year.  The income and educational qualification that applied in 2005 will again apply to this category.  In addition, new entrants who are farming leased / rented land will be eligible for an allocation provided they can demonstrate a genuine commitment to farming.  In this context the leased/rented land must have been declared on the 2004 Area Aid application and on the 2005 and 2006 Single Payment Scheme applications.</P>
        <P>My Department has forwarded a 2006 National Reserve application form to the person named for his attention.  Should the person named feel that he qualifies for the 2006 National Reserve he should return the completed application form to <Col N="1481"/>my Department offices in Portlaoise as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The person in this case benefited under the New Entrants provision of the Single Payment Scheme, in that his Entitlements were established on the basis of the exclusion of 2000 and 2001.  An issue subsequently arose in relation to the incorporation of the sugar compensation into his Single Payment, where it was found that he had been farming during 2001.  It is necessary, therefore, to recalculate the Entitlements of the person involved, following which my Department will be in direct contact with the person.</P>

	<P>Expenditure on the rental of temporary school accommodation is as follows:</P>

        <P LI="1">2006 &mdash; to end of November: &euro;22.1m.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
        <P>The provision of rented accommodation provides an immediate solution to a deficit of school accommodation, and is often the only available option where extra accommodation is needed at short notice.</P><Col N="1487"/>
        <P>However, the current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new devolved initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow schools to undertake a permanent sol<Col N="1488"/>ution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. Since the introduction of the devolved initiative over 200 schools have been allocated funding under this scheme.</P>
        <P>As can be seen from the table below the spend on temporary accommodation represents a very small fraction of the overall yearly spend on school buildings.</P><Col N="1487"/>

This will bring the total number of literacy places to 38,000.

	<P>The National Educational Welfare Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/ guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board&rsquo;s functions locally. The total authorised staffing complement of the Board is 94 comprising 16 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 12 Senior EWO&rsquo;s and 61 EWO&rsquo;s. Since September 2005 every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service.</P>
        <P>The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide. Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Educational Welfare Officers play a pivotal role in implementing the service provided by the NEWB through monitoring school attendance and working to improve it. The EWOs also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.</P><Col N="1489"/>
        <P>In addition to the NEWB personnel there are some 490 staff, within the education sector, deployed in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves an element of school attendance and significant scope exists for integrated working between these personnel and Educational Welfare Officers. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed including NEWB resources. It is anticipated that the outcome of this work will inform my Department on the staffing requirement for the NEWB into the future.</P>
        <P>The current cost to the Exchequer of providing this service is &euro;8.15 million. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2007 include a provision of &euro;9.8 million for the National Educational Welfare Board. This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level.</P>
        <P>This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk. Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.</P>
        <P>The increase in funding for the Board will allow it to expand its services further and increase staffing. This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB&rsquo;s staffing under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question regarding the cost to the Exchequer of employing the 73 service delivery staff mentioned above, and the additional cost of increasing the number to 300 education welfare officers nationwide, I am currently awaiting data on payroll costs from the NEWB in respect of these service delivery staff. I will respond directly to the Deputy when this information is available.</P>

	<P>The Strategic Innovation Fund was established by the Government to promote collaboration, support change and enhance quality in Irish higher education so that it is equipped to meet the challenge of driving Ireland&rsquo;s development as a leading knowledge economy.  It reflects the reality that for Irish higher education to attain world class standards, we need to identify creative approaches that build on the collective strengths of our institutions, working together as a cohesive system. The Strategic Innovation Fund involves the provision of &euro;300 million over five years. </P>
        <P>In July 2006 a first call for proposals under this Fund was issued by the Higher Education Authority to third level institutions. Two further calls of &euro;130 million each are envisaged.</P>
        <P>On 24 October 2006 I announced details of the allocation of over &euro;42 million to third level institutions across the country under this first cycle of funding from the &euro;300 million fund.  A total of fourteen major projects have been approved for funding following an independent assessment conducted by a panel of international experts.</P>
        <P>The projects approved are aimed at enhancing collaboration between higher education institutions, improving teaching and learning, supporting institutional reform, promoting access and lifelong learning and supporting the development of fourth level education.  Due to the collaborative nature of the projects approved, all seven universities, thirteen institutes of technology and the DIT will be involved in a number of projects.  This strong level of collaboration between universities and institutes of technology is particularly encouraging.</P>

	<P>We have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996/97. Indeed, the number of PLC places approved for 2005/2006 was up by more than 1,600 on the 2004/05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188.</P>
        <P>Applications are received from providers each year for PLC courses and based on these applications an allocation for a particular number of places is sanctioned.  These allocations are made to the VECs where colleges are under their remit or directly to Secondary and Community Schools.  Some courses are not proceeded with due to insufficient interest from students therefore the number of applications does not necessarily reflect the demand for courses.  It should be noted that 725 of the allocated places were not used in 2005.</P>
        <P>The level of resources for the PLC sector will be determined in the light of resources generally and the implications for other areas of education. The scope for rationalisation of provision, will also be examined having due regard to ensuring appropriate provision, on a geographic basis and the necessary critical mass for delivery of a quality education service.</P>

        <P>Under the terms of the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Post Leaving Certificate Courses 2006, grants are available to eligible candidates who are entering approved PLC courses for the first time in the 2006/2007 academic year.  Candidates are ineligible if they already hold a FETAC Level 5 qualification (formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 2 qualification) a FETAC Level 6 qualification (formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 3 qualification) or a third level qualification at Level 6 or higher. However, notwithstanding this condition candidates who already hold a qualification no higher than FETAC Level 5 (formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 2) and are now pursuing a course that offers progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid.</P>
        <P>My Department understands that the candidate, referred to by the Deputy, holds a FETAC Level 5 in Secretarial Studies.  As outlined above, <Col N="1493"/>the candidate is ineligible for grant assistance in respect of the PLC Montessori course being pursued in the current academic year as it leads to a second FETAC Level 5 qualification.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the terms of the schemes are of general application and it is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the scheme and make exceptions in individual cases.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 to 297, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has shown an unrivalled commitment to ensuring that children and young people with special needs get the extra support they need in order to reach their full potential at school. We have dramatically expanded investment in special education in recent years and we have improved access to the state examinations for young people with special needs.</P>
        <P>Annotations on certificates only apply in situations where a core area of a subject is not assessed, or where the mode of assessment used has the same effect. The scheme was introduced following the report of an expert advisory group, and the introduction enabled opportunities to be provided for exemptions where a candidate was not in a position to demonstrate achievement in a core area of assessment.  This change, for example, enabled a hearing impaired student to be exempt for the first time from the aural component of language subjects. His/her marks on the balance of the examination would be grossed up proportionately towards 100%, and the certificate would include a note to the effect that all elements of the subject were assessed except the aural component. Spelling and grammar waivers in language subjects were provided to cater for students with dyslexia on a similar basis, with annotation of the certificates. The aim of these changes was to facilitate the operation of a responsive and flexible system which enables all candidates to demonstrate their achievements, while preserving the integrity and fairness of the exams by ensuring that special arrangements are operated in a transparent manner.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Equality Tribunal&rsquo;s recent findings, the legal position is that they must either be implemented in full or appealed within the specified timeframe under the Equal Status Act <Col N="1495"/>2002. My Department has examined the findings and is concerned both that the widening of access through the use of exemptions coupled with annotations has not been fully understood in this case and that the fundamental nature of the accommodations being provided has been questioned. It has therefore been decided to appeal the findings.</P>
        <P>When the scheme of accommodations was expanded in 2000 an appeals system was provided for, enabling candidates to appeal decisions within the framework of principles recommended by the Expert Advisory Group. It is normal practice for appeals systems to operate with a clear mandate, and the set of principles adopted in this respect was in keeping with international practice.</P>
        <P>The policy of awarding bonus marks awards in the state examinations was introduced by the government in the 1920s as one of a number of initiatives to promote the study of subjects through Irish, reflecting the Constitutional position of Irish as the first language.  This continues to the present day in the context of wider public policy to promote the Irish language, and is a facility open to all students. In such cases the candidates have been assessed in all components of the examination.</P>
        <P>Neither the Department nor the State Examinations Commission provides information on pupils with disabilities to the CAO. Cases where all components in the subject were not assessed were flagged to the CAO at the outset, but this practice ended when it was indicated that the information was not required. The Educational Welfare Act allows for the sharing of information for the purpose of recording a person&rsquo;s educational progress. The Equal Status Act 2000 had been subject to wide ranging consultation before it was enacted, and information on its requirements was available within the Department at the stage when the recommendations of the Expert Advisory Group was adopted. No difficulty was envisaged. The issue of annotation had been fully explored in advance of the Report on the Task Force on Dyslexia.</P>
        <P>I am aware that it is not the practice in third level institutions to include notations on certificates. The position is not analogous in that third level awards are not centrally marked and subject to a published marking scheme.  As a general rule, third level colleges do not provide for exemptions from a core area of assessment.  Given that this case is to be appealed to the Circuit Court, it is not appropriate that I make any further comment in the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The participation rate of students with a disability in third level education has improved significantly over the past ten years.  In 1994, there were just 400 students with a disability in the sector (about 0.5% of full-time undergraduates), while recent indications from the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) are that there are now over 2,700 students with a disability in higher education (about 2.4% of full-time undergraduates).  Key measures which have contributed to this increase in participation have been the allocation by my Department through the HEA of dedicated strategic and core funding for the development of access and disability support services to higher education institutions.  In addition, funding is allocated to a range of student supports and services through the Fund for Students with a Disability. In 2005/6, &euro;1,631,979 was allocated to 408 students with a disability in 10 third level institutions in the HSE West area.</P>
        <P>Figures from the National Office for Equity of Access to Third Level Education and AHEAD indicate that, on average, over half (52%) of all students with a disability in higher education have a specific learning disability (for example, dyslexia), about 16% of students have a mobility disability, 8% have mental health difficulties, 7% are deaf or hard of hearing, 5% are blind or visually impaired and 12% have other disabilities, including, I understand, a small number of students with intellectual disabilities.</P>
        <P>Support structures across the education system, in particular systems of needs assessment and educational planning, are also being progressed by the National Council for Special Education, which was established on a statutory basis following the enactment of the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004.  The plan of work of the NCSE will ensure that the needs of young people with a disability in primary and secondary education are being met from the very earliest stages of their education.</P>
        <P>Under the Disability Act, 2005, the Council, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, has a key role in supporting young people and adults with a disability in progressing their studies beyond school into further and higher education, the legislation also places important obligations on education providers in accommodating the needs of students with a disability.  With improved systems of assessment and support for students in first and second level education, combined with the continuity of support provided for under the Disability Act 2005, I am confident that we will see more students with a disability, includ<Col N="1497"/>ing those with an intellectual disability, progressing to further and higher education in the years to come.</P>

	<P>The Third Level Student Support Schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration (pursued in a university or a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds) in other EU Member States with effect from the 1996/97 academic year.

        <P>Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside of Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has made huge progress in increasing the staffing in our primary schools both nationally and in Kildare.</P>
        <P>Nationally, there are now no less than 4,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002, and nearly 7,000 more than there were in 1997. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.</P>
        <P>The number of primary teachers in Kildare has increased by 60%, under this Government.</P>
        <P>While the average class size in Kildare is slightly above the average, as detailed below, nonetheless major improvements have been made. When we came into office, there were 3,397 children in classes of 35 or more in Kildare schools. This has been dramatically reduced to 531 children in the 05/06 school year. The average class size has also been reduced, while the number of children in classes of 30 or more has significantly decreased also.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I want to assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of the particular pressures on schools in Kildare and that addressing their needs is a priority for me. In the past two years, I have put in place specific measures to address the needs of growing schools by making it easier to qualify for a developing school post. Over 300 such posts were sanctioned for the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06. This change specifically addressed the needs of schools which are seeing large increases in their enrolments year on year.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate the need to make further progress in reducing class size, it should be acknowledged just how much has been achieved.</P><Col N="1500"/>
        <P>In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those that need help with their English.</P>
        <P>Special education provision in particular has undergone a level of expansion the extent of which nobody could have predicted a few years ago &mdash; and this was only right. If we had put all 4,000 of the teachers hired since 2002 into classroom teaching, our average class size would be a lot smaller than it is now. But we would have done a great disservice to those children who need extra help the most. I am sure the Deputy would accept that we have taken the right approach.</P>
        <P>Now that children with special needs are finally getting the support they deserve, we are providing extra teachers this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year, we are committed to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in my reply to D&aacute;il Question No. 271 on 23 November 2006, Military Service Allowance (MSA) was made pensionable in the case of Defence Forces personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990 on foot of a recommendation made by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission).  This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners and there is no scope for departing from this policy in the case of MSA.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that, of the 9,727 persons in receipt of pensions under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes, approximately 3,630 are pre-August, 1990 pensioners who do not qualify for MSA in their pension.  It is estimated that about 50% of this latter number retired (or died) while in receipt of the MSA as serving members of the Defence Forces, i.e. between 1 May 1979 (when the allowance was first introduced) and 1 August 1990 (the commencement date of the MSA being made pensionable).</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 521 of 5 December 2006.  The total cost to my Department of work undertaken in both 2004 and 2005 for the mapping of special areas of conservation which involved the assistance of a helicopter was &euro;64,117 inclusive of VAT @21%. This total relates, as required by my Department&rsquo;s tender specification, to inclusive costs for data capture and analysis per kilometre of river. The cost element of helicopter hire was not separately priced.</P>
        <P>My Department sought tenders for this work in November 2004. Three companies submitted a tender.  Following assessment, 2 were deemed to meet the tender requirements. Contracts for some of the GPS related survey work proposed were awarded in December 2004 to RSK Orbital Ltd. and Gaelic Helicopters Ltd.  Work under both contracts was completed by March, 2005.</P>

	<P>Estimates for the 2007 housing programme are set out in the Abridged Estimates Volume, which was recently published.   Details in relation to disabled persons, essential repairs and improvement grants will be published as part of the Revised Estimates for the Public Service early in 2007.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have detailed estimates available of the costs associated with an increase in the allowable maximum grant under the disabled persons grant scheme to &euro;30,000 or the cost of increasing the grant to cover 100% of the cost of works.  Factors such as the demand led nature of the scheme, the number and value of grants paid in any one year, differences in buildings costs across the country, the percentage of grant paid by each local authority and the percentage of the work covered by the current maximum grant in individual cases, would have significant impact on the calculation of these estimates.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the scheme, the maximum grant of &euro;20,320 can cover up to 90% of the cost of the works to private houses.  The grant may cover the full cost of the works to local authority dwellings.</P>
        <P>A review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme, which incorporates the conditions governing the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, was recently finalised within my Department.  Proposals for the future operation of the schemes <Col N="1510"/>are being prepared and are expected to be announced early next year.</P>
