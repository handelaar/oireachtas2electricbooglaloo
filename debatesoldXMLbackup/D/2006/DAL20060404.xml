	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As agreed with the social partners, the negotiations are being conducted on a strand-based approach. The first strand within the negotiations on a new pay agreement has focused on the issue of employment standards. A great deal of time and energy has been devoted to this but it is important for all of us that we get the right balance between ensuring decent employment standards while maintaining our competitiveness, flexibility and attractiveness to investment. A number of plenary and bilateral meetings have been held in this regard and contacts are ongoing with a view to establishing the scope and possibilities that exist for agreement on the issue. I hope, with a bit of goodwill and flexibility on all sides, we will be able to move on soon to address pay and other workplace related issues.</P>
        <P>A round of bilateral meetings has also taken place with each of the four pillars &mdash; trade union, business-employer, farming and community and voluntary &mdash; at which the pillars have set out in greater detail their key issues and priorities for a new agreement of which the pay agreement would be one part. Subsequent plenary meetings have discussed, <i>inter alia</i>, the National Economic and Social Council report, The Developmental Welfare State, the Fitzpatrick Associates review of the special initiatives implemented under Sustaining Progress, the implications of the proposed long-term framework for social partnership, the macroeconomic context for the negotiations and the economic, environmental, infrastructural and social policy priorities within a new agreement.</P>
        <P>A further round of multilateral engagement on more specific priorities in respect of these wider non-pay issues, where the social partners have agreed that a long-term perspective is appropriate for full implementation, has also been completed. The primary purpose of this round of engagement is to secure from the partners greater clarity and detail concerning what they consider might be achieved through the social partnership process in each of the identified thematic areas.</P>
        <P>While I have not been directly involved since the initial plenary meeting on 2 February, I am kept fully informed by the Secretary General of my Department, who is chairing the ongoing negotiations. Officials of the relevant Departments are participating in the talks. The positions to be finally agreed in the context of these talks will reflect the Government&rsquo;s policy priorities, since the response to the social partners in the talks is determined by my colleagues and I. At this point, it seems unlikely that the negotiations can be concluded by Easter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his response and welcome his comment on the central feature of employment standards. Recent <Col N="1079"/>revelations in the context of the mushroom industry make this matter pertinent. Is the Taoiseach holding out for the prospect of a ten-year national partnership agreement or is it likely that we will face some type of sticking plaster 18-month short-term agreement? Is there a sense that the Government will be in a position to conclude a ten-year partnership agreement?</P>
        <P>What response has there been to the recent report of NCB Stockbrokers on migration? It clearly indicated and predicted another 15 years of inward migration, of the order of 40,000 per year, to drive economic growth. It also predicted upward pressure on house prices, which are a central feature of life today. What impact did the report have on the partnership talks?</P>
        <P>I refer to a matter which I raised with the Taoiseach last week in respect of the current system of social partnership. A total of 400,000 people drive with provisional licences while some 132,000 await driving tests. I understand that tests were cancelled in Ballina today due to road works. This means people, young people in particular, pay an additional &euro;23 million in insurance premia they should not have to pay. There is a stigma attached to being unable to qualify as a driver, as well as social disruption when one is unable to take up a job because of one&rsquo;s lack of a full driving licence.</P>
        <P>Outsourcing has been inhibited within the current structure of social partnership. I understand it was to be used to deal with the backlog. Since this issue was raised, has the Taoiseach been able to deal with the trade unions in terms of getting a derogation under social partnership? When discussions with the social partners are resumed, will this issue, which has a direct influence on standards and, ultimately, on matters of life and death, be a central theme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the first question regarding time spans, at the initial plenary meeting of the social partnership discussions in February I proposed that our approach to the negotiations should be based on the shared vision for the country outlined by the National Economic and Social Council. NESC put forward the ten year concept, thus reflecting the need for a medium to longer term policy, planning and reform framework. NESC set out the arguments very well in this regard and I specifically stated we should consider agreeing on a ten year framework for a social partnership process so it can be aligned to and contribute to the development and implementation of the longer term agenda. The continuity and momentum of such a longer term agreement would itself make for a greater degree of confidence in delivery.</P>
        <P>Such a longer term approach would be accompanied by specific pay agreements. Hence, such agreements would form part of the overall context, whether they were for 18 months or three years &mdash; different aspects would change. <Col N="1080"/>However, the overall agenda would be longer, as outlined in detail by the NESC and this is the Government&rsquo;s preference. The social partners would consider some aspects to be part of the ten year strategy while others would have a shorter term life. Obviously, such issues change. In our experience, a matter which was important in one social partnership can become almost irrelevant in another.</P>
        <P>However, a rolling medium to longer term perspective would be supported by specific policies over a shorter period that would help competitiveness and skills training. It would provide sustainable employment opportunities, improve workplace conditions and help build an inclusive society. This has been the basis of the discussions and the nature of the approach to such a longer term perspective is being pursued in the context of the ongoing negotiations. Obviously, pay is a shorter term issue.</P>
        <P>I note the Deputy&rsquo;s observations regarding the mushroom industry. There have been a number of such incidents and all have been followed up by the inspectorate. In all cases, the inspectorate has done good work. As many employers have begun to come forward with information, people have begun to wake up to the facts in this regard. We must try to induce all employers and subcontractors to follow this agenda, which will take some time. One detailed aspect of the talks pertains to the question as to how this should be resolved in the longer term and how it should be made to work effectively on the ground. This has probably been the key issue at the talks to date.</P>
        <P>As for the driver testing issue, while there is broad agreement as to how it should be handled, the individual workers concerned do not yet share that view. We have been engaged with this issue. Much preparatory work has been carried out to find out how the issue can be dealt with and handled efficiently by outside contractors so we can deal with the backlog and the difficulties that have been evident for some time. Officials of the Department of Transport believe this is an excellent way to progress. It is not being done at the expense of the individuals involved because they will continue to have security of employment. However, they are reluctant to make the necessary changes. As we will not be able to resolve the difficulties in the context of the present arrangements, we must find a new way to deal with the issue. The model of this approach has been outlined and it is ready to be put in place if we can reach agreement. Like all of these issues, it cannot be done by rolling over people. We must try to convince people about what we are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the decision by the MANDATE trade union to withdraw from the social partnership process blows the myth that this is a high wage economy? Does he accept that the members of MANDATE took the decision primarily because <Col N="1081"/>the greater number of them receive a very poor return for their work? Does he recognise that the majority of these members work in bars, restaurants and shops which form a highly profitable sector, yet these workers are not getting a return commensurate with their labour? Does he not accept that, since its inception, the social partnership process has failed these workers? Does he not accept that many workers have been left lagging behind and that while it is not confined to MANDATE membership, it is where it is most apparent and most acute?</P>
        <P>There has been evidence in recent days of a further tranche of workers working for a Serbian company, which is involved in subcontracting work for the ESB, who have been paid an outrageous return of approximately &euro;4.96 an hour? Will the Taoiseach tell these workers and their colleagues, who are correctly and courageously standing shoulder to shoulder with them, what the partnership process will do to correct this type of abuse? Does he agree that current employment protections and regulations are not being adhered to by those who subcontract for work on major schemes and it is not the first time that either State or semi-State contracts have been involved? Does he agree that these abuses are taking place within the State and semi-State sector where public money is involved, and there is a legion of such examples down through the years?</P>
        <P>As the Leader of the Government, does the Taoiseach agree that it is appropriate that all State and semi-State companies, including local authorities, should carry out a full audit and appraisal of the work practices of all these companies to whom they have contracted out public works? This should be done to ensure that there is full adherence to hard fought for and hard won trade union rights and levels of remuneration for Irish workers, which should be enjoyed right across the board and without distinction. Will the Taoiseach join me in calling for a rigorous review, for want of a better description, of all such contracts to ensure that where this practice is currently taking place, we do not learn of it piecemeal, with others able to operate in a continuum, and that rather we now see a situation whereby companies which are prepared to abuse are put on notice that they will not be considered for public contract works in the future unless they immediately desist?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On low-paid workers, the position always depends on where one places the benchmark. People make their cases in negotiations, but generally the low-paid workers about whom Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is talking are not on the minimum wage, which is untaxed. In terms of take-home pay, those on the minimum wage are in a much better position than their international competitors in most industries. Obviously, people make their cases in negotiations, not just in terms of the social partnership but in the Labour Court. That will continue and it is the right of people to <Col N="1082"/>try to improve their lot. It is normal for workers and those who represent them to do so.</P>
        <P>As I said, one of the big issues is dealing with employment standards, both by trying to maintain competitiveness and attractiveness to investors while at the same time ensuring decent employment standards. I know from the ongoing discussions that these are complex issues and people have different perspectives on them. I was involved in a number of disputes, directly or indirectly, last year, which were difficult to handle. Contacts between my officials and employers and trade unions are ongoing with a view to establishing the possibilities for progress on this issue. With goodwill and flexibility on all sides, we will be able to move ahead and address pay and related issues.</P>
        <P>It is clear that a rapidly changing labour market brings new challenges in the area of maintaining and developing employment standards and we are committed to meeting these challenges. I have repeatedly made explicit the Government&rsquo;s intention to engage fully and effectively in a process of devising policies to deal with the challenges, protect employment standards and prevent the so-called race to the bottom. We have been doing that in the discussions which I hope will reach a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the ESB and other State companies. As regards the ESB, the Moneypoint power station issue came to light as a result of audits of compliance initiated by the ESB, so the company was doing precisely what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in suggested companies should do. All other companies should do likewise. I welcome the proactive role the ESB played in this matter. The labour inspectorate contacted the principal parties on the issue a few days before Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day and subsequently met senior representatives of the ESB and their agents. These contacts have been ongoing for the past two weeks or so. In the meantime, labour inspectors have commenced inquiries with the contractor concerned and have visited the head office and the site at Moneypoint. Inquiries are continuing and a further visit will take place later this week.</P>
        <P>The inspectorate is examining documentation already obtained from the contractor, who has been co-operating fully with the investigation. I am aware of the suggestion that there has been victimisation of some of the workers involved. The Labour Relations Commission has made contact with the parties involved to offer its services in assisting in an agreed solution, and I urge the parties to co-operate. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, who has responsibility for labour affairs, has also been dealing with this matter.</P>
        <P>The matter relating to the Serbian workers goes back over a number of months. The view was that a resolution had been found in October. I am aware a dispute has arisen between the <Col N="1083"/>TEEU and Laing O&rsquo;Rourke, the main contractor, over the liability of the subcontractor involved, Energoprojekt Oprema, for further back moneys. An investigation by labour inspectors into the most recent allegations has taken place. The TEEU and several non-national workers have already provided statements with the assistance of an independent translator. Further clarification is being sought on a number of issues including the status of certain workers and their appropriate statutory entitlements. It would neither be helpful nor appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of that investigation.</P>
        <P>The mushroom industry was also mentioned. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, have already been involved in trying to make progress on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>How can workers in Ireland take the concept of partnership with any seriousness when every week new scandals of worker exploitation emerge? How can they take the Government as being serious in any sense when, for example, a Polish company which was outed a few weeks ago as a major exploiter can turn around and sack and victimise the workers who brought that exploitation to trade union and public attention and feel the confidence to do this under the present Government? How can Aer Lingus workers take the concept of partnership seriously when the Government is proposing to ram the privatisation of the national airline down their throats, when the experience of privatised industries in this State has been disastrous so far as workers&rsquo; wages and conditions are concerned, as witnessed in Irish Ferries?</P>
        <P Just="Left">What did the Government decide today on Aer Lingus privatisation? Will the Government make a complete mockery of what ordinary people might consider to be partnership by foisting privatisation against the will of the majority of Aer Lingus workers and throwing them to the stock market wolves with disastrous potential consequences for jobs, pensions, security and their future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As always on these issues I do not agree with the perspective taken by Deputy Joe Higgins. Workers in this country have not done badly out of social partnership. Their job security and ability to get the same employment and proper standards have been dramatically improved every year for the past 20 years. That continues.</P>
        <P>There have been individual cases of exploitation and I have referred to a few of them. Obviously it would be better if nobody engaged in such practices. The labour inspectorate and the various companies must deal with that. Where 2 million people work, there will be people who <Col N="1084"/>will exploit workers. The discussion is on how to minimise such exploitation to the greatest extent possible by employers, especially private sector ones, working together with those who represent workers. An effort is being made to tie this down, whether by legislation, arrangement or local understandings, and to do so to the best possible effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what leads up to that kind of exploitation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to Aer Lingus, as Deputy Joe Higgins is aware, security of employment was far from certain when it was in the State sector. Thousands of jobs were lost when the State had total control. As I have said previously, I am in favour of private equity being invested in Aer Lingus. I am in favour of the company growing, expanding, developing, increasing employment and gaining strength in the aviation market. I do not want to see it continue in the old ways of reducing employment and suffering every time there is a difficulty. I continue to support it. When one considers the European Union-United States open skies policy and the opportunities it has created to develop and expand employment, I believe strongly that this is the way we should proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will proceed with the privatisation of Aer Lingus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Have disputes in Gama, Irish Ferries, the mushroom industry and a number of other cases influenced the social partnership talks? Does the Taoiseach have in mind measures that would allay concerns about job displacement? Does he expect discussions on a new enforcement agency to reach a conclusion? Will the social partners sign off on the appointment of 40 additional labour inspectors? Has progress been made on the issue of providing a care package for the elderly, which I understand is to be part of the final outcome of the partnership talks?</P>
        <P>What is the impact on the partnership talks of the current ideological drive by Government to substantially privatise Aer Lingus? Has the Taoiseach taken into account the SIPTU decision, taken by a vote of nine to one, to engage in industrial action if privatisation proceeds without agreement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise from this group of questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The basis of the question is the effect of the SIPTU decision on the partnership talks and whether it has been taken into account.</P>
        <P>Will the Forf&aacute;s report be central to the partnership talks given the stark message it sends to Government regarding the doubling of the coun<Col N="1085"/>try&rsquo;s oil consumption in the past 15 years? Does Ireland face a difficult future given that average oil consumption <i>per capita</i> here is 50% above the European Union average? Will these issues have a bearing on a social partnership agreement? Will the Government produce a strategy on reducing energy demand and delivering freedom from oil dependency and, if so, will it form part of the social partnership process? If that strategy is to have real meaning will it be taken on board in a social partnership agreement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, the major issue in these talks has been getting agreement on an enforcement system and new arrangements to deal with workers and employers and the issues that came to light in some of the disputes the Deputy mentioned. Discussion on this issue has been long and arduous over a period of several weeks. There is always some big issue in every social partnership agreement, and this is the big issue in these talks. While progress has been made on many other questions in the economic, social and development strands of the talks, the big issue has been to see if the social partners can find a way to balance the protection of workers&rsquo; rights with the need to deal with the issues of flexibility, competition and foreign direct investment and to agree on a system with which both sides can live. Obviously, there are different points of view and people have to argue a case on behalf of those they represent. All the efforts of officials of my Department have been focused on trying to bridge the gap and get a solution which the Government believes it can work through its various agencies and which it can make stick in the wider economy.</P>
        <P>All the published reports, including the NESF report, show that demographic change will continue and a large number of people will continue to come here. Whatever the figures, different reports on immigration matters indicate that a substantial number of people will arrive here and we must ensure they as well as our own workforce are protected. The big issue is whether that is possible. Ultimately, the Government will decide what legislative measures will be put forward but we will make our determination on this before the talks with the social partners. However, regulation of the labour market is most effective when the provisions have the support of the social partners. That is what we are endeavouring to secure and why we have been encouraging them to find an agreed position in the current talks. That has the best likelihood of fitting into an agreement.</P>
        <P>Obviously, what is agreed in the social partnership process relates to issues that are put forward by the social partners and the Government. Some of the issues raised by the Deputy are not in the social partnership context but are broader issues of the economy. The Minister is working on the energy policy Green Paper, which will be published shortly. In so far as people work to co-<Col N="1086"/>operate and deal with some of the challenges of the future, if it is in the social partnership agreement, all the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Fourteen labour inspectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments that the issue of protection of employment standards has the talks bogged down. The talks were to conclude by St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day but now the Taoiseach says they will not conclude by Easter. Outside of more labour inspectors in whatever agency they might be organised, what is being contemplated and why is the issue proving so difficult to resolve? Only a few months ago the Labour Party published a document and a large number of eminent persons, such as former EU Commissioners, archbishops, academics and a number of others, were recruited to say there is no displacement. Clearly, we have at last reached the stage where we acknowledge there is displacement, although not of the eminent personages who write about it.</P>
        <P>Other than the straightforward invigilation of labour standards, what measures are likely to be taken? Are there tensions between public sector and private sector representatives? Can the Taoiseach brief the House on the up-to-date dow in terms of anticipating a new benchmarking exercise? What is the effect of the apparent commitment on the part of the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association to proceed in any event with their own settlement? In respect of the exclusion of the MANDATE trade union, which is a significant union numerically, can the interests of a union such as MANDATE, with workers in modestly paid employment in the private sector, be encompassed in the wider discussions in a fashion that is reasonably fair to these workers?</P>
        <P>If the talks progress to a pay settlement, is the settlement not likely to last for longer than 18 months? Is that likely to be the duration in the discussions? There was a recommendation in the Labour Party paper that there should be proofing of public contracts for compliance with labour conditions. Is there any good reason why, whether it involves a local authority, State company or the State directly, the award of a public contract cannot be proofed for compliance with good labour standards and so obviate some of the phenomena we have seen recently?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would not describe the talks as bogged down but it is a difficult issue to resolve. It means getting a balance where both sides can be satisfied that they have enough in substance and in terms of protection to ensure there is proper regulatory and legislative compliance.</P>
        <P>As much as anything, inspectors are there to police and investigate. Employers and, in particular, trade unions would like to see a spirit among people to implement this in an honourable <Col N="1087"/>way rather than try to find the means of getting around it. Its aim is to ensure that employment standards are something with serious intent, at least on behalf of all organised employers in the State. The object is not just to think of the agenda of flexibility, competitiveness and private sector issues. That is their challenge. Is that trust, spirit and goodwill there? They are trying to find a way forward.</P>
        <P>Trade unions would strongly argue that it would be far better if this kind of case did not arise. If employers and their organisations are well organised through two or three organisations and if they follow a system of good employment standards, most of the difficulties will not arise. That is what trade unions want to see as much as anything else. The Government will obviously have to legislate and have an inspectorate and this will be far better than having this conflict of employers almost saying this is the way to go and that it is a competitive force in the economy that will drive it forward. That happens in other countries and creates many difficulties. It certainly would not be compatible with social partnership.</P>
        <P>There are a range of measures under discussion, including those the Deputy raised. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions put forward an extensive list at the start of the year in its negotiating document, as did a number of other people. All of those issues have been up for discussion, but obviously they will not all be agreed or all form part of the agreement. The agenda is that broad one mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether there is a mechanism that can be found for proofing. It has been discussed and some of the trade unions have raised the issue. It is at least a way of policing public sector contracts to check compliance.</P>
        <P>The next round of benchmarking is at the end of 2007. Some of the issues raised in these talks, such as flexibility, will come up then in terms of the private sector. There has not been great progress on the pay side. We will, hopefully, get around to that shortly. The sides have put down their opening positions. I expect the private sector unions will argue for some kind of flexibility, although this is not something with which the employers agree. The negotiations must take place shortly if we are to have an agreement.</P>
        <P>What is envisaged for the public sector benchmarking arrangements is more or less the same as the last time with, perhaps, some improvements based on that experience. By and large the arrangements will be based on the previous experience.</P>
        <P>Did the Deputy ask me about some other issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I have forgotten. With regard to the Cabinet decision to proceed with the sale of a majority stake in Aer Lingus, does the Taoiseach anticipate this could be a breaking point with the <Col N="1088"/>trade unions in terms of the social partnership discussions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked about some other area; it will come back to me.</P>
        <P>I hope not. The Minister has been engaged and continues to engage with the trade unions. He is conscious of their concerns. In allowing the sale of Aer Lingus to proceed we hope the concerns highlighted by the trade unions in numerous meetings, as late as last night, can be dealt with. There are obviously concerns about employment status and pensions. The Government and the Ministers for Finance and Transport have been directly involved and are anxious that we reach satisfactory understandings on these issues. This will help the company to grow, while at the same time dealing with the issues that the trade unions have rightly raised.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would always prefer that everyone stayed within the centralised arrangement and it would be negotiated on that basis. As the Deputy knows, with practically every agreement some large group, for one reason or other, pulls out. However, MANDATE workers and lower paid workers are the big winners when one looks back over the years on positions maintained in this country as against other countries. It is quite clear that the minimum wage, flat-rate sums and tax arrangements were part of agreements. The position is far better for organised labour and the improvements are clear to see, relative to other countries. One can always examine pay relative to some other grade but if one looks at where people were three, five, seven or ten years ago, relative to where other countries were, the gains from social partnership are clear. The improvement is quite substantial across all the lower paid grades in this country as against&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is not the attitude to take.</P>
        <P>The question of the INO is a different one. It has made a strategic decision because it believes its case can stand up better on its own. It believes that rather than trying to complete a centralised agreement, it can put forward its own case. Unions sometimes take that view and we have to deal with that in the ongoing negotiations. To be frank, however, I would prefer if these matters were dealt with on a central basis.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 41 together.</P>
        <P>I share the deep concern of Deputies about the situation in Iraq. The level of sectarian violence has been increasing in recent months with terrible consequences for ordinary Iraqi citizens. For well over a year, armed groups based in the Sunni community have engaged openly in sectarian attacks on Shia and Kurdish civilians. The cynical aim of their suicide and car bomb attacks on markets, mosques and other public places has been to cause the maximum number of civilian casualties, provoke retaliation and foment civil strife and chaos across Iraq.</P>
        <P>Until recently, the Shia community has generally followed the guidance of its political and religious leaders and avoided retaliation. However, the attacks and killings following the destruction of the holy Shia shrine in Samarra in February were a stark reminder of the danger of <Col N="1090"/>uncontrolled sectarian violence. There had already been disturbing signs of a growing level of retaliatory violence by Shia militias, including evidence of death squads operating within the Iraqi security forces. The House will be aware that US troops have, on a number of occasions in recent months, located large numbers of prisoners who were secretly detained by these groups and, in some cases, abused and tortured.</P>
        <P>This deterioration in the security situation has developed despite considerable progress in the formal process of political reconstruction, under UN guidance. Three democratic national elections have been successfully held. A new constitution has been approved by referendum and adopted and a freely-elected Iraqi Government has been in office since May 2005. These are substantial achievements and the high level of participation by the Iraqi people in the democratic process has shown the importance they attach to the political process, following decades of brutal dictatorship. The maintenance of this level of political commitment will be crucial if civil war in Iraq is to be avoided.</P>
        <P>Most people now accept the only way to avoid further chaos and to build a secure future for the Iraqi people is for the Iraqi Government to establish effective administration over the country with the assistance and support of the international community. This must involve the development of effective national security forces with the capacity to take over responsibilities exercised by international forces operating in Iraq under UN sanction.</P>
        <P>Following the democratic elections held in December 2005, the next important step must be the formation of a new broadly-based and sovereign Government, mandated for four years. Undoubtedly the recent violence has made agreement between the parties representing the different Iraqi communities more difficult to achieve. The strong message, however, from the EU and the wider international community has been that the establishment of a Government with the broadest possible base in the Iraqi parliament is an urgent national priority for Iraq.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and I discussed the Iraqi situation with the US President, Mr. Bush and his advisers when we met at the White House on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. Mr. Bush was aware of the difficult situation in Iraq. He indicated his determination to maintain US involvement as long as is necessary. The situation in Iraq has also been discussed at the recent meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. It will be on the agenda for next Monday&rsquo;s meeting in Luxembourg.</P>
        <P>It remains the Government&rsquo;s position, and that of our EU partners, to continue to support the Iraqi people and their elected government as they work to create the conditions under which they can assume full authority for the security of their country. The EU&rsquo;s support will continue to focus on assistance to the political process, capacity <Col N="1091"/>building in Iraqi Government ministries, training of criminal justice professionals, reconstruction of infrastructure and public services and humanitarian relief.</P>
        <P>Against this difficult background, it is disturbing and deeply disappointing to learn of serious allegations of misappropriation of funds that should have been devoted to reconstruction and to the welfare of the Iraqi people. The allegations relate to Iraqi funds controlled by the UN and to US Government funds. If true, some of the more recent allegations are simply disgraceful. Some individuals and companies, including well-established ones, have already paid substantial fines following proceedings in US courts.</P>
        <P>Most of the allegations which have so far come to light relate to the period of the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 to 2004.</P>
        <P el="10">
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>There seems very little doubt that major mistakes were made at that stage in addressing and overseeing the work of reconstruction. The position is that the UN Security Council authorised payment of Iraqi funds, including frozen accounts and oil revenues, into the development fund for Iraq, which was administered by the Coalition Provisional Authority. The Security Council also established a body, called the International Advisory and Monitoring Board for Iraq, to oversee and audit the use of these funds. The body, and its auditors, KPMG, have drawn attention in their reports to the lack of control over expenditure both in the Coalition Provisional Authority and in Iraqi ministries. However, only a few months after the auditors were appointed the Coalition Provisional Authority was dissolved, and administration of the funds transferred to the new Iraqi Government.</P>
        <P>The Government has no way of assessing accurately the basis of the allegations made. However, I agree fully that it is unacceptable if funds intended for the relief of the Iraqi people have been misspent, or worse. Responsibility for investigating such allegations rests primarily with the United Nations Security Council, and with the International Advisory and Monitoring Board established by it. The Iraqi Government and the US Administration clearly also have their own substantial responsibilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked if the Minister for Foreign Affairs would press for a UN investigation into the misappropriation of funds. Instead the Minister spent four minutes before addressing the misappropriation of 363 tonnes of 100 dollar bills imported into Iraq since the lifting of sanctions on 22 May 2003. There is a black hole of accountability in this matter with no monitoring of spending. The administrative arm of the US and UK forces in Baghdad failed to establish a monitoring committee on the spending of the reconstruction <Col N="1092"/>funding. An administrative monitoring agency was only established when a further UN resolution insisted on it.</P>
        <P>This is the largest financial fraud in the UN&rsquo;s history. People are dying in hospitals and on the side of the street because of the lack of services in that war-torn country. What specific actions will the Minister take to ensure an investigation into the misappropriation of this funding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the length of reply.</P>
        <P>This is primarily a matter for the UN Security Council which authorised the payment of these funds into the development fund for Iraq. It established the International Advisory and Monitoring Board for Iraq to examine these allegations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yet UN Resolution No. 1483 failed to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Allow the Minister reply without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The body and its auditors, KPMG, have drawn attention to the lack of control over expenditure. These allegations relate to the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority&rsquo;s time in power. It has been dissolved and the administration of the funds has been transferred to the new Iraqi Government. So far no allegations have been made against that government of misappropriation or misuse of funds. The Irish Government can exhort its colleagues on the UN Security Council which has the primary responsibility to ensure funds are not misappropriated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to recognise that those funds that have gone missing, have done so at the level of the banking system. In the oil for food programme, it was not the persons who were distributing the food in Iraq that were involved in fraud but those contracted to supply the food. It is the same on the construction side. Again, international trading companies defrauded the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.</P>
        <P>Mr. Allawi, the former Prime Minister of Iraq, told the BBC, &ldquo;We are losing each day an average 50 to 60 people throughout the country, if not more. If this is not civil war, then God knows what civil war is&rdquo;. The destruction of the Shi&rsquo;ite mosque in Samarra was followed by the destruction of other mosques. Is it not clear that Iraq is at the edge, if not in, a civil war? Is that not indicated by the talks taking place between the US and Iranian authorities on how to construct a Shi&rsquo;ite consensus? If that happens, it will lead to the further exclusion of the Sunni population in Iraq. Is there any basis for assuming a unitary state in Iraq will remain? Current talks indicate a division on a religious basis. Will the Minister agree that the loss of 50 to 60 civilian lives every day is an <Col N="1093"/>indication that the situation has deteriorated into a civil conflict?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The argument of whether the horrendous loss of life in Iraq should be defined as &ldquo;civil war&rdquo; is semantic. There is a concerted effort to drag the country into a sustained period of civil strife. Despite the killings, several religious and political leaders have been restrained in their responses to them. Efforts are continuing to draw together a broadly-based Iraqi Government but it has not been easy. The Iraqi people have a strong desire for the establishment of democratic institutions and their own hands on power. However, there is a long way to go yet.</P>
        <P>Recently I had discussions with the newly accredited Iraqi ambassador to Ireland. Given our history, the Irish are cognisant of the TV pictures of the awful events in Iraq. However, the ambassador pointed out to me that substantial peace reigns in 14 out of the 18 regions in Iraq. In some places, there are daily flights to and from Frankfurt and Amsterdam. That is not to diminish what is happening in other significant areas of Iraq. All efforts of the international community are to endeavour to have as broadly based a representative government as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a failure to form a government three months after the elections. Will the Minister agree that the talks between US representatives and Iran on constructing a Shi&rsquo;ite consensus is working in the opposite direction to the stated position of the EU, which is in favour of a unitary state even with federal arrangements? Is it the view of the European Union that a religiously or ethnically divided Iraq is acceptable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The priority must be to get a government which is supported by all sides.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister says he is a great friend of President Bush and the US Administration, but has he asked the President where all the money has gone from Iraq? Where have the 363 tonnes of hundred dollar bills that were shipped to Iraq gone? There were enough banknotes to pay for the Pentagon four times over but where has that money gone? Will the Minister get real and accept that the Administration there, beyond the green line, has lost control in Iraq? There is no water or electricity and people cannot walk the streets without the fear of being kidnapped or killed. The police force in Iraq has been infiltrated by militias so one does not know whether a peacekeeping unit or a death squad is calling to one&rsquo;s house. The Minister should get real and accept that the war there is one against humanity and that nobody is safe on any side. Will the US Administration be asked the hard question about where the money has gone? Will the Taoiseach and the Minister insist on an audit <Col N="1094"/>of the moneys shipped to Iraq and the expenditure concerned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The UN Security Council has responsibility for this matter. Any information concerning the improper use of funds must be transmitted to the monitoring board. We did not raise this issue with the President when we met him recently, although we did raise the unfortunate and difficult situation in Iraq. It is important to emphasise what has happened there over recent years. There has been a huge resurgence in the people&rsquo;s desire to have their own government and the establishment of democratic institutions. It must be recognised that there are a small number of insurgents who are endeavouring to cause civil war and undo the good that has been done. Many people were surprised at the developments concerning the elections, the referendum and the establishment of an Iraqi government. It was never going to be easy given the different religious factions there. The main focus should be on trying to get a government in place that has broad support from all factions. We should not focus on other issues.</P>

        <Quest>his views on the results of the parliamentary elections in Israel; the implications which this result holds for the roadmap for peace; the mandate he feels that the incoming Government has been granted with regard to the future of Israeli and Palestinian negotiations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[13169/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been closely following the developments since last week&rsquo;s general elections in Israel. I offer my congratulations to acting Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, on the success of his party, Kadima, which is now the largest party in the Knesset. It seems clear that he and other Israeli political leaders will need some time to negotiate the formation of a new coalition government.</P>
        <P>The Irish Government strongly believes that as the political situation following the Palestinian and Israeli elections settles, it will be clear that the basic reality remains that the only way in which a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflict can be found is through the negotiation of a mutually acceptable and viable two state solution. This must involve the coexistence in peace and security of the state of Israel and a truly viable Palestinian state with agreed international borders.</P>
        <P>Negotiations on the basis of agreed fundamental principles are the only option. The pursuit of progress through unilateral actions by either party or both parties will not create the conditions for long-term peace. I therefore warmly welcome the statement by acting Prime Minister Olmert, in his victory speech on 29 March, that <Col N="1095"/>there is no good alternative to a peace agreement and that while his goal is to bring about the establishment of the final borders of Israel as a Jewish state and a democratic country, his Government will work to achieve this through negotiations and through an agreement with their Palestinian neighbours.</P>
        <P>The Government looks forward to developing a good working relationship with the new Israeli Government and to maintaining the open and frank relationship which enables us to discuss directly and constructively our views on the obligations on the parties under the roadmap and under international law. We will continue to raise directly with the Israeli Government our concerns, which are shared by all our EU partners, on Israeli policies and activities in the occupied territories, which are contrary to international law and which threaten to undermine a solution based on the coexistence of two viable states.</P>
        <P>I continue to hope that the new Hamas Government will take seriously the clear messages from the EU and the international Quartet on the conditions for engagement with the international community. They have also received clear advice on the way forward from President Mahmoud Abbas, their Arab neighbours and in direct discussions with representatives of the governments of Russia and Turkey.</P>
        <P>The Government, in common with our EU partners, strongly supports the requirement that the Hamas Government renounces violence, disarms, recognises Israel&rsquo;s right to exist and accepts existing agreements reached by negotiation between the PLO, the Palestinian Authority and Israel. If there is any evidence of a willingness to make progress on these steps, based unequivocally on the continued absence of violence, I will strongly urge a response from the EU. The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I will attend in Luxembourg next Monday, will further review developments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I find one part of that answer truly extraordinary. I understand that Prime Minister Olmert is, in fact, speaking about a unilateral extension of the borders of Jerusalem further into the occupied area, east through the Jordan valley. It has nothing whatever to do with the Quartet or the roadmap for peace. What Mr. Olmert has announced is in flat rejection of what were called the Quartet&rsquo;s final stage talks. The Quartet spoke about dealing with east Jerusalem as the final stage. When 8,200 families were removed from Gaza last year, some 36,000 permissions were given illegally in the occupied territories.</P>
        <P>This has led the second report of the Euro-Mediterranean network of human rights organisations, which includes human rights organisations on all sides of the Mediterranean, to draw a distinction between what it calls operative diplo<Col N="1096"/>macy and the declarative diplomacy of the European Union. It means that the EU issues statements that have no implications but accepts what are called practical arrangements or new realities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>New realities are further illegal settlements. By accepting this language and these terms from Israel, the EU is undermining international humanitarian and human rights law. For the life of me, therefore, I cannot see how the EU is being of any assistance at all by accepting an alternative that has at its centre further illegal settlements in breach of international law and in flagrant breach of human rights law.</P>
        <P>We all hope that Hamas, in turn, will take a political rather than a military direction. I agree entirely that it is urgent for it to do so. The flaw in what is happening, however, is that we in Europe will be presented with a reality in which the land will already have been spoken for. There is now no final stage in the Quartet talks. The land is already occupied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In his initial statements, the acting Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Olmert, indicated that he looks forward to dealing with the Palestinians on the basis of negotiations. Through the EU, the Irish Government has always made it known strongly that the transfer by Israel of its own population into occupied territory is in breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The situation is that such transfers are illegal. The EU will accept nothing less than a return to the pre-1967 border situation.</P>
        <P>I accept that the direction that has been taken by the Israeli authorities concerning the occupied territories and building the wall goes against the principles agreed in the roadmap. It also goes against the principles accepted by the international community on having a two state solution. Equally, however, there are questions to be answered by the Palestinians on whether Hamas is willing to accept democracy and the normal rules under which it would participate in a democracy. Getting a mandate in a democratic election brings with it responsibilities. As the Deputy knows with regard to our own experience, Hamas cannot be part of the democratic system if it still adheres to violence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with the Minister&rsquo;s statements on Hamas. However, while Israel has been in breach of human rights law and international humanitarian law, the decision of the European Union to enter into technical arrangements on customs co-operation and make an informal arrangement on research was a reward for breaking Article 2 of the basic agreement between Israel and the European Union. The European Union watched and saw clear breaches, offered no sanctions and stayed silent <Col N="1097"/>on the further occupation of the land, especially that which extends beyond east Jerusalem.</P>
        <P>It was interesting that the Heads of Mission and representatives of various European countries prepared a report last October and November in which they appealed to their Heads of State to make a statement before it was too late on the further expansion of east Jerusalem. That is now a key situation. East Jerusalem has been expanded by an area one and a half times the size of Paris. Entire communities have been surrounded and it will effectively cut the occupied West Bank in two. What is left as a viable Palestinian state are three cantons, namely, Gaza and the north and south occupied West Bank. It is time to realise that what is being put at stake by these unilateral actions is the viability of the two state solution itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to Deputy Michael D. Higgins, the EU could break off all discussions with Israel on the basis of what that country is doing. I fully accept what the Deputy stated about its extension into occupied territories. It is incumbent on the EU and the international community to exhort Israel. The comments made by acting Prime Minister, Mr. Olmert, and the non-violence so far of Hamas provide a possibility. It is accepted that the situation is very fraught and difficult. The coming weeks will tell a tale on how far&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>It is not correct to state the EU should break off relationships with Israel. A number of association agreements with Israel exist, as does the neighbourhood action plan. These allow us the authority to raise issues on the basis we are all on the one side in dealing with Israel through normal bilateral arrangements between a country such as Israel and the EU.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.</P>
        <P>The Government attaches the highest priority to the welfare of the undocumented Irish in the United States, and takes every opportunity in contacts with US political leaders to emphasise the importance of addressing the matter in a constructive and sympathetic way. As Deputies are aware, the debate in the US on immigration reform has entered a critical stage. The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period provided the Government with an especially timely opportunity to make known our views on this matter and, in particular, our strong support for the approach favoured by Senators Kennedy and McCain. It was an opportunity we availed of to the full in our meetings with President Bush, his Administration and key figures on Capitol Hill. President Bush was appreciative of our position and he helpfully reiterated to us his support for a broad approach which involves reform as well as enforcement, an approach he subsequently emphasised again in speeches later in the month.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and I had a series of valuable meetings with members of Congress. In each of these meetings we gave particular prominence to our views on the issue of the undocumented Irish and the need to address the situation. We were particularly pleased to have the opportunity again to thank Senators Kennedy and McCain for their leadership on this issue. For their part they are warmly appreciative of the Government&rsquo;s support and that of the Oireachtas for their efforts.</P>
        <P>The engagement of the Government is complemented most effectively by the significant <Col N="1099"/>mobilisation of the Irish community in the US on this issue. In this regard, the Taoiseach and I had a valuable discussion with Niall O&rsquo;Dowd and Grant Lally of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR. I commend the work of the ILIR which has had a significant impact on the debate in Washington and elsewhere in the US and whose work I have been pleased to support financially. We agreed to remain in close contact as the legislative process in Washington progresses.</P>
        <P>Since our St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit, there has been a positive development with the passage through the Senate Judiciary Committee of a comprehensive immigration reform Bill which includes key elements of the approach favoured by Senators Kennedy and McCain. I consider this to be a significant development and warmly welcome it. However, it remains clear that reaching consensus on this sensitive and divisive issue presents US legislators with a formidable challenge. Consideration of this matter has moved to the floor of the full Senate where a debate began on Wednesday last, 29 March.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to monitor the ongoing debate closely and emphasise our strong support for the regularisation of the status of the undocumented Irish in the US. In this regard, I warmly welcome last week&rsquo;s visit of the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to Washington.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Have a substantial number of Republican Senators and members of the House of Representatives expressed concern about the idea of an amnesty for those they consider illegal? I know the Minister lobbied the President of the United States and certain Senators. Has the Minister lobbied those members of the Republican Party who appear to be recalcitrant? How effective was the lobbying campaign carried out by Niall O&rsquo;Dowd and others? Is there a sense that the Minister is inhibited by his lobbying efforts from raising other important matters such as extraordinary renditions, Guantanamo Bay and the war in Iraq because he wants to deal with this issue in a comprehensive way and is trying to express his concerns about the undocumented Irish? Do these concerns inhibit the Minister from raising other issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not. During our meeting with President Bush on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day we spent more time discussing other issues than the undocumented Irish. We know the President&rsquo;s position on the undocumented Irish. I understand from our contacts that he was very helpful this week in trying to progress the debate positively. He clearly stated the Administration and Congress would not wear an amnesty. We are progressing to a situation where the lobby on behalf of the Kennedy-McCain legislation, which includes an element of providing people with an <Col N="1100"/>opportunity to have a path to what is termed permanent residency, has come from the Senate Judiciary Committee to the floor of the Senate. In recent days we had discussions with Senators Kennedy and McCain on its possibility of succeeding in the Senate.</P>
        <P>A suggestion was made that I might travel there this week because it is approaching its final position. However, a judgment was made that the best time for me to travel, and I intend to do so if the need arises, is at the reconciliation stage, which is the term used when the Bill has already gone through Congress, of the Sensenbrenner Bill on border security. We had previous discussions on this issue.</P>
        <P>What emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee is not exactly the Kennedy McCain legislation. However, it is critical to get that legislation passed by the Senate so that it will go to the reconciliation stage. We lobbied many people on all sides. I reiterate my understanding that this week President Bush has been more than helpful in trying to steer some of the people in his party to a view that this matter should and could be dealt with. I exhorted the Irish representatives to form a proper group to lobby the public representatives, and we fund the resulting group. I did this because in the early stages of lobbying we heard that Irish people were not exactly hammering down the doors of the Congressmen and public representatives on this issue. The formation of the lobby group and the rally it held engendered other groups. A crowd of 500,000 congregated, mainly Hispanic people which has largely turned the tide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke about consensus and reconciliation and I agree almost totally with his analysis that the Senate faces a major task in addressing the report of the judiciary committee. I fear, however, that it may get through the Senate before the Easter recess but the House of Representatives will be the main stumbling block. I hope what emerges from the process will reflect the efforts of all sides of the political spectrum here and that it will be positive for the 40,000 or 50,000 Irish people in the United States.</P>
        <P>A group from Fine Gael visited last year and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs visited in June. I was a member of that group, and Deputy Michael Higgins was a member of the group that visited last week. The Minister and the Taoiseach were there for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s words of consensus and reconciliation are limited. On my return from the United States last Friday as I caught up with the news in the local papers I saw an article headed &ldquo;My Fight for the Lost Irish in America&rdquo;, written by the Minister. The Minister argues that there should be all-party support for this valid cause but the political bile, hatred, nastiness, untruths and divisiveness displayed in that article did no credit to him, his Department or the cause we all serve. All parties in the House are united on this <Col N="1101"/>issue and supported a motion in favour of it. I ask the Minister to retract the untruths in that article which rubbished the efforts of the Opposition.</P>
        <P>The Opposition may not have the expertise and back-up of the army of civil servants available to the Minister but we have gone to the United States at some personal cost and loss of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not retract anything in that article. I too am a political animal and I will portray my side on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

        <Quest>the recent discussions he has had with his European counterparts with regard to the formation of EU battlegroups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[13045/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The ambition of the EU to be able to respond quickly to emerging crises has been, and continues to be, a key objective of the development of the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. An important aspect of ESDP is the development of a stand-by military rapid response capacity, in the form of battlegroups.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Almost all EU member states have already made a commitment to contribute to a specific battlegroup formation. Apart from Ireland, the only countries that have not done so are Denmark, which is in a special position due to its opt-out in this area, and Malta. Ireland has indicated to its EU partners a positive disposition to taking part in battlegroups. In this context, and as I have previously reported to the House in Parliamentary Questions Nos. 241 of 2 February 2005, 36 of 28 April 2005 and 45 of 2 June 2005, I met the Foreign Ministers of Sweden and Finland in January 2005 and the Foreign Minister of Austria in April 2005. In the course of those meetings, I discussed a range of issues, including possible Irish participation in battlegroups.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the legal, operational and other issues surrounding participation have been considered by an interdepartmental working group, established by the Minister for Defence, which included representatives of my Department. The report of the working group has been considered by the Cabinet committee on European affairs and, informally, by the Government. Following on from this, more detailed discussions with other like-minded nations on a potential contribution by Ireland to a battlegroup have now commenced. A delegation consisting of representatives from the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces met their Swedish counterparts in Stockholm on 10 March to discuss possible participation by the Defence Forces in the Nordic battlegroup, which is due to be on stand-by during 2008. As the Minister for Defence has already outlined to the House, our representatives outlined Ireland&rsquo;s position in respect of battlegroup participation and international peacekeeping generally and gave a presentation on the capabilities Ireland could make available to a battlegroup.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This offer is now being considered by Sweden, which is the framework nation for the Nordic battlegroup, and its partners. Further consultations between the Defence Forces and the Swedish armed forces and between officials of the respective Departments are likely. I would expect these to conclude within the next few months. Any decision on a specific contribution to a battlegroup would be subject to formal Government approval.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1105"/>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the concept of a battlegroup is that of one which is capable of responding effectively and rapidly to global crises such as genocide? The Minister for Defence attended a recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Committee at which he set out his plans, which were in line with the Minister&rsquo;s previous comments. Could the Minister calmly clarify certain matters which I find puzzling?</P>
        <P>A battlegroup is designed to provide a rapid response to crises. As the Minister noted, Ireland will be part of a battlegroup which also includes Sweden. This battlegroup will consist of approximately 500 personnel and will be located somewhere in Europe where it will be ready to respond to a global crisis. In the event that a call is made to send the battlegroup to respond quickly to a crisis, Ireland will be unable to take part in the operation because it must obtain the approval of the Government and the D&aacute;il and receive a mandate from the UN Security Council &mdash; the triple lock mechanism. This mandate could take between one and three months to obtain or may never be obtained. Does the Minister see the potential for major embarrassment for Ireland in such a scenario whereby it is revealed as being unable to respond as part of a battlegroup because it is paralysed by the triple lock? Could he explain the obvious contradiction between the definition of a battlegroup and the triple lock mechanism to which we are tied?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that we wish to participate in this battlegroup, largely because we have been exhorted to do so by the UN, particularly by the Secretary General, Kofi Annan. He has requested that Ireland does so as one of the countries in the UN infrastructure with the highest proportion of UN peacekeeping forces per head of population currently taking part in operations in difficult and dangerous parts of the world. However, this Government is adamant that there must be UN authorisation for the participation of our troops in any peacekeeping force and I believe our position is held by most Irish people. I accept that this may cause some difficulties in respect of particular requests for us to participate in a battlegroup operation but it is the current position of this Government and I cannot envisage any change in this policy.</P>
        <P>I am not making a political point but Deputy Allen is saying one thing while the two parties with which his party proposes to enter Government hold completely different views in respect of this matter. The Government is adamant that we must acquire the approval of the Government and the D&aacute;il and UN authorisation for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in any battlegroup operation. This is because of the discomfort Irish people feel about Irish troops engaging in conflicts without UN authorisation. The Irish people welcome and are proud of the participation of Irish troops in UN peacekeeping operations with UN authorisation. <Col N="1106"/>We are clear that any participation by Irish troops in battlegroup operations or any amending legislation we bring forward in order to participate in battlegroups will retain the concept of the triple lock. This may cause us difficulty in respect of particular events, although, hopefully, this will not occur. If it does, other countries which do not have this requirement must step in. We, however, have this requirement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

	<P>It is a matter of common sense. The Minister spoke about the view of the Irish people on the matter but this has never been tested. If tested, it would be revealed that the Irish people believe that Irish foreign policy should not be dictated by countries like China, which would have the power to veto any Irish initiative. This is the net effect of the triple lock. A major contradiction and potential source of embarrassment for Ireland exist in this regard so we must think the matter through. We should not take for granted that we know the view of the people on this matter when it has never been tested. From listening to people, I believe that they do not want our foreign policy to be dictated by China and other permanent members of the UN Security Council.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief. Does the Minister still agree that the title of the group is unfortunate? I understand he made this point originally. If such groups had been called human rights protection groups, which would reflect the move away from humanitarian intervention and towards humanitarian protection in UN thinking, it would provide an entirely different view. Is it not the case that different humanitarian protection groups could reply and respond with different speeds, given their constitutional context? When the time comes to legislate to accommodate any participation, could the Minister acknowledge this in, possibly, the title of such groups?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1107"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister correctly pointed out that my party supports the triple lock. Has Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the battlegroups given rise to additional pressure on it to abandon the triple lock? Is the triple lock regarded as an impediment to full participation in the battlegroups?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not led to any pressure on us in respect of our participation in battlegroups. Our position is quite clear. A number of other countries which also require UN authorisation to participate, among them, Finland, and to a certain extent, Austria, have eased this requirement.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Michael D. Higgins. We found grave fault with the term &ldquo;battlegroup&rdquo;. We would rather use the term &ldquo;rapid reaction in relation to humanitarian&rdquo;, which is the terminology used by the UN. Irrespective of what we say or do in respect of our legislation, we raised this matter with many of our EU colleagues. As a result of certain issues relating to the military definition of the type of force which is being put together, it has become clear that &ldquo;battlegroup&rdquo; is the common term used throughout the EU.</P>
        <P>Deputy Allen is mistaken in arguing that there is a contradiction. Our position is quite clear on the requirement imposed by the triple lock. The only contradiction in this debate is the position held by Deputy Allen&rsquo;s party and the other two putative parties in the alternative Government. These three parties should agree on a common position before they form an alliance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 48, 49, 94, 97, 109 and 112 together.</P>
        <P>Regarding the general political and security situation in Iraq and the allegations of the misappropriation of funds for reconstruction, I refer the Deputies to my previous replies to two Priority Questions. Despite very real progress in the establishment of democratic political institutions in Iraq, the Government and our partners in the EU are seriously concerned about the continuing violence in the country and the increased threat of civil strife. The formation of a new, broadly based Iraqi Government following the democratic elections held in December is now an urgent priority. The EU is determined to continue to support the Iraqi Government and people as they work to reconstruct their political and economic systems and society following years of dictatorship and war.</P>
        <P>I would like to address a number of specific points raised by Deputies in these questions. It is important to recognise that the status of the US-led coalition in Iraq changed in June 2004. The international forces are now there under a UN mandate and at the invitation of the elected Iraqi Government. As recently as November 2005 the Security Council unanimously extended that mandate until the end of 2006. I look forward to the day when the Government of Iraq decides it has the resources and capacity to provide security for its citizens without outside help. Regrettably, that day has not yet arrived.</P>
        <P>I met the new Iraqi ambassador to Ireland, Dr. Salah Al-Shaikhly, when he presented his credentials to President McAleese on 21 March. I was pleased to welcome him as the first Iraqi ambassador accredited to Ireland in more than 15 years. We had a useful discussion on the situation in Iraq and the prospects for progress. I assured him of the deep sympathy in Ireland for the suffering of the Iraqi people. Dr. Al-Shaikhly was frank about the difficulties facing Iraq at present <Col N="1109"/>but was anxious to emphasise that much of the country was largely free of the violence reported daily in the media. He also said that Iraq continues to need military assistance from international forces while looking forward to the day when the Iraqi authorities could assume full responsibility for security. Deputies will wish to be aware that I also underlined the great importance the Government and her family attach to the Iraqi authorities finding and bringing to justice the killers of Mrs. Margaret Hassan and locating her remains. The ambassador assured me that he would do everything he could to ensure progress on this tragic case.</P>
        <P>I am aware of reports, to which Deputy Allen referred, concerning the situation of Palestinian refugees in Iraq, in particular the small group of refugees that left a camp near Baghdad and attempted unsuccessfully to cross into Jordan. Unfortunately, it is the case that increasing sectarian strife has raised the sense of threat felt by minority groups such as Palestinians, Turkomans and members of the different Iraqi Christian communities. The Government supports the statement of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who urged the Iraqi Government, despite all the difficulties, to fulfil its obligations to protect refugees in its territory. Most of the Palestinians in question have been in Iraq for decades. Indeed, many of them were born in Iraq and I would agree with the approach of the UNHCR in asking the Iraqi authorities to expedite the process of granting them legal residency within the country as the best means of putting their status on a firmer footing. I would also agree with the UNHCR that the area of western Iraq near the Jordanian border is considerably more dangerous than the camps where they had been based.</P>
        <P>I am of course concerned by reports alleging excessive use of force by international forces in Iraq. The Government has clearly stated its view numerous times that any use of force in civilian areas should be kept to a minimum and every effort must be made to avoid civilian casualties. The US authorities are fully aware of the Government&rsquo;s views and our specific concerns about incidents such as those at Abu Ghraib prison. At this time, the greatest threat to the Iraqi people comes from armed groups that are attempting to foment large scale civil strife and chaos through gun and bomb attacks on innocent men, women and children going about their daily lives. No one can excuse the use of force from whatever source directed against the civilian population. It is our duty at this stage to give our full support to those courageous Iraqis who are working in very difficult circumstances to create a new, united, democratic and prosperous Iraq following years in which their country&rsquo;s potential has been sapped by dictatorship and war.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We have discussed some of these issues through other Priority Questions but <Col N="1110"/>I will put them to the Minister as follows: The current head of security of the interim Iraqi Government suggests that it is in charge of approximately 30% of the country. More than 80% of all people polled in Iraq are in agreement that it would be the best outcome if foreign occupational forces left the country. At the same time, there is the issue of how to create security. Has the future federal structure of Iraq been discussed at the level of the European Council of Ministers? I previously put it to the Minister that the talks taking place between the United States and Iran, for example, is an attempt to determine if an agreement with the Shi&rsquo;ite community would enable a withdrawal of US troops in the short term. However, this would inevitably lead to the exclusion of Sunni groups. We have heard nothing from any European Minister regarding the future of Iraq&rsquo;s Kurdish areas. Does all of this mean the likelihood of a break up of Iraq being the only means by which a withdrawal of foreign troops can be managed?</P>
        <P>The Minister would find it difficult in international law to suggest that the nature of a country&rsquo;s occupation, originally without a mandate, could be changed even with a Security Council resolution. For example, does this mean that the new force involved in the task of reconstruction is now bound by all international conventions, including the Geneva Convention, in its relations and responsibilities to the civilian population? If so, why did Dr. Condoleezza Rice say that thousands of mistakes have been made in Iraq?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>To the best of my knowledge, there have been no discussions with my officials on the structure, federal or otherwise, of the Iraqi Government. As I said in previous replies, the EU is adamant that the Government&rsquo;s formation is entirely a matter for the Iraqi people and that the Administration to be formed must be as broadly based as possible. All efforts should be made in that area.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, the UN mandate is sometimes misunderstood in terms of the presence of the multinational force currently in Iraq. On 8 November 2005, the UN Security Council unanimously mandated for the first time the presence of the international force to continue until 2006 or any earlier period. While it does not currently appear as though it will leave, troops must comply with all international laws and standards on human rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is less than a year since the tragic bus accident in Navan in which five young teenagers lost their lives. It is appropriate that we begin by expressing our sympathies to the parents and friends of the pupil from Killina Presentation secondary school in Clara, County Offaly, who unfortunately died and to those who were injured. I understand that the emergency services operated effectively and quickly.</P>
      <P>Approximately 130,000 children are transported to school everyday by the transport service of the Department of Education and Science. Many thousands of other children travel to school using private bus operators, which is encouraged by the Department where there might not be sufficient numbers to warrant a full-scale departmental service.</P>
      <P>Naturally, the safety of those children is of concern to all Members. Has the Taoiseach an up-to-date report on this accident and the tragic circumstances surrounding it? Does he have information concerning the mechanical state of the vehicle involved and whether it possessed a certificate under the relevant NCT? Is it the case that while this bus was not fitted with seat belts, private buses carrying school children to school are not required to be so fitted? Was the bus licensed by the Department of Transport and what checks, if <Col N="1112"/>any, were carried out in that respect? Does the Taoiseach have a report to hand as to how many children were on the bus? Were some children required to stand?</P>
      <P>I understand that two inquiries have been initiated, one by the Department of Transport and the other by the Garda. Obviously, they will take some time to report. I am sure the Taoiseach shares my sympathy for those involved in the tragedy and the concern of the many thousands of parents whose children avail of privately operated bus schemes to be transported to school that the highest standards should apply and that a similar tragedy should not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I express the sympathy of the House to the family, relatives and community of the 15 year old person who was killed in this tragic accident. This is a sad and black day for them and I pass on the sympathy of the Government and all Members. We wish a speedy and full recovery to the 12 people who were brought to hospital and understand the shock experienced by all others involved.</P>
      <P>This was a tragic accident involving a school bus taking children to Killina Presentation secondary school in Rahan, County Offaly. As Deputy Kenny noted, the midlands accident and emergency master plan was put into full operation and ambulances from Portlaoise, Tullamore and Athlone attended the scene. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, will visit the families and the school later this evening to extend my deepest sympathy to them all.</P>
      <P>The Garda is investigating fully the circumstances of the tragic event to establish the causes of the accident and any contributory factors relating to it. Members will appreciate that it would be inappropriate of me to make further comment until I receive the details. In so far as I can reply to some of Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s questions, my understanding, based on information from Bus &Eacute;ireann, is that the operation in question was not a contracted school bus, but a private hire management. Vehicles engaged in private hire are licensed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a large public service licence. They are required to undergo an annual roadworthiness test undertaken at the authorised test centres which are appointed by the local authorities. I understand the bus in question was the subject of its annual roadworthiness test at the outset of the school year last September. I understand that while it was not necessary for the bus to be licensed with the Department of Transport, the operator was required to be, and was so licensed.</P>
      <P>There was much discussion on this issue in this House last year after the tragic accident in Meath. We continue with the process of fulfilling our own regulations and the EU directives regarding seat belts on vehicles. A number of issues arise in this respect that are ongoing at present. That work <Col N="1113"/>will continue. I again give our sympathy to the families concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. In a response to Question No. 76 of 15 February 2006 from Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan of the Labour Party, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, replied to the effect that buses which are hired privately are not subject to the same regulations as those operating within the Department of Education and Science scheme and that the Department does not have any influence or authority regarding the operation of such buses. Parents who make a contract with a contractor to provide a private bus are expected to ensure that the required safety standards apply, but often it is extremely difficult for a community of parents to do so as they are anxious to get a transport scheme to operate for their children. This can frequently happen when there are insufficient numbers for a full departmental scheme to apply.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Taoiseach initiate a review of the number of school children who are carried by privately operated buses under schemes operating outside the control of the Department of Education and Science to the Department&rsquo;s schools, as outlined in Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s question in February of this year. Two parallel systems exist. One operates under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science, which seeks to implement the highest possible standards following the tragic deaths of five young people last year. In the other system, in which parents are expected to ensure that the highest standards apply, private bus operators with licences are contracted to provide a similar service to Department of Education and Science schools. Would it not be appropriate to make it mandatory that the same set of standards and safety issues should apply when private bus operators operate a private contract for parents? This should be taken for granted and parents should not be expected to know all the details of such standards or to ensure that they apply For children involved in education, the same high levels of safety standards should apply in terms of vehicles, licences, seat belts etc., regardless of whether they are transported by a scheme operated by the Department of Education and Science or by a private contracted service.</P>
      <P>Hence, I bring to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention a recommendation made by Deputy Naughten in 1999 in the all-party report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science dealing with educational issues, namely, that those safety standards which apply to public school transport should also apply in the case of privately contracted buses. Perhaps the Taoiseach will take these issues on board in view of the recurrence of tragic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Some, if not all, of those well made points are under examination &mdash; I will <Col N="1114"/>ensure all of them are considered &mdash; following last year&rsquo;s events. As the Deputy noted, although the safety check for roadworthiness takes place under the authorised test centres, the same level of safety standards that apply to public buses, be they CIE buses or Bus &Eacute;ireann buses, do not apply to privately contracted buses.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Today, I spoke to the responsible Ministers about this issue and they briefed me on the developments in recent months with regard to the various directives. Those issues are being considered. Our law will incorporate a number of directives to the effect that from October 2007, all new buses, other than for scheduled services, must be fitted with safety belts. However, a large proportion of our buses are older stock. Moreover, we buy older buses &mdash; presumably private contractors also do so &mdash; which are not fitted with seat belts. Following last year&rsquo;s school bus accident in Kentstown, we decided the school transport fleet would be fitted with seat belts on a phased basis and that the entire fleet would be so equipped by no later than the end of this year. In addition, the application of Directive 2003/20/EC will mean that the wearing of seat belts on school buses, once fitted, will be mandatory. While there is the question of a bus operator who is not part of the system, I am sure the matter is being examined. Ideally, the same standards should apply to transport for all school children, especially in rural areas. There is the question of what happens in the case of the scheduled service, which would apply to buses within cities. I understand these issues are being examined. I will bring to the attention of the relevant parties all the points made by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>On my behalf and that of my Labour Party colleagues, I join Deputy Kenny and the Taoiseach in extending our sincere sympathy to the parents and wider family of the 15 year old youth who was so tragically killed in this accident, and wish a speedy recovery to all those who were injured.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach inform the House on a speech he made at the weekend where he expressed concern that we should be nicer to banks. While it is important to the economy that banks are financially sound and profitable, surely he is aware that banks in this country are the most profitable in Europe. I am puzzled why he thinks we should be nicer to them. He was very nice to them when he discontinued the &euro;100 million levy in the budget. What does he think we can do that would be nicer to them?</P>
      <P>The two big banks in this country take three times&rsquo; more profit per customer than the average bank in Europe. How can we be nicer to them than that? As the Taoiseach is aware, there is entirely inadequate competition in the financial services sector. It is not just me saying so; it is out of the State&rsquo;s own mouth and the mouth of the Government&rsquo;s watchdog. Both the Competition Authority and the National Competitiveness <Col N="1115"/>Council indicted the financial sector for inadequate competition. In its report, the Competition Authority found that between 2001 and 2004, small and medium enterprises forfeited &euro;250 million because of the manner in which the reduction in interest rates was applied by banks to SMEs during that four-year period.</P>
      <P>Banks have been major beneficiaries of some tax incentive schemes. In its report prior to Christmas, the Central Bank expressed concern at the rate of expansion of personal credit at 25% per annum since the last quarter of 2003. It also sounded a warning about debt increasing at a rate of more than three times the national income. Against that background, and as a self-professed socialist, why was the Taoiseach so concerned at the weekend about banks and can he give us any tips on how we can all be nicer to them?</P>

One of the great selling points of the Irish economy is that more than half of the international banks are based here. There is now more than &euro;1 trillion under funds management in this country. Before attending lunch with the <Col N="1116"/>international banks and the IBF, I opened a new wing in Dundrum of the HSBC bank, the Hong Kong and Chinese bank, where there will be a new training and education centre where, in conjunction with the universities, people will be trained to work in the financial services industry, something I have advocated for a long time, and banks will bring their staff, mostly from European locations, to train here.</P>
      <P>I made the point that if another industry such as a car company, an information and communications technology industry, or an agricultural co-operative industry makes a profit, people will say it is a good performance because the company made a profit. However, people think there is something wrong if banks make a profit. I have no difficulty saying that the banks should be competitive and charge competitive rates. The best way to do so is to have competition in the market. The bankers I addressed were the people who create that environment, not representatives of just the two main banks in the country.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy had an opportunity to read my speech, he would have found it acceptable. I noted over the weekend that the Deputy now thinks all our economic policies, which he disapproved of previously, are now excellent. He omitted one policy, namely, capital gains tax, and he might tell us about that. However, he believes all our other policies are correct. I have no doubt that in the future he will agree with what I said about banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>One never knows where it might lead. Would the Taoiseach not be better speaking to banks about the findings of his agencies, including the Competition Authority, the National Competitiveness Council and the Central Bank, which are major issues of public interest? While it is important that banks are profitable because they are major employers, there is a balance in all these matters. The normal tug of the market that applies in some of the private and public companies to which the Taoiseach referred do not apply in the case of the banks. This is the finding of the Government&rsquo;s agencies such as the Competition Authority. What about all the small companies who found themselves levied to the extent of &euro;250 million over four years because of the misapplication of interest rate reductions at the time? Three times&rsquo; the profit per customer is extracted in this jurisdiction compared with the average bank in Europe.</P>
      <P>Given the forum he had, the Taoiseach might have raised these issues. I enjoy all his speeches when I have the good fortune to be present, but I had other duties to attend to at the weekend. However, I will catch up on what he said. I cannot find any instance of the Taoiseach referring to the fact that he dropped the &euro;100 million levy which was applied to the banks by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, who said at the time it was right the banks should contribute to the <Col N="1117"/>public finances. I do not see any reference to the fact the banks are the most profitable in Europe, that the take per customer is three times the average in Europe and that the SMEs forfeited &euro;0.25 billion.</P>
      <P>These are major issues. Competition depends on new entrants yet it is virtually impossible to get into the Irish banking market place. These are questions the Taoiseach might have raised rather than counselling the rest of us to be nicer to the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte knows I do not write the headlines. I was addressing the IFSC banks creating that competition, rather than Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland only. The broad international bank sector is bringing quality employment here. I have no argument with the agency&rsquo;s assertion that our main commercial banks should, along with making profits internationally and at home, give value for money and charge us only what is absolutely necessary. Without mentioning names, many of the bigger banks which we have brought to Ireland in recent years are helping to drive that competition.</P>
      <P>The levy was applied for a period under an agreement by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, and the banking sector. The current Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is taking another initiative to which I hope the banks will fully contribute. The initial levy was an arrangement made for a fixed period, which is finished. It has its own difficulties but the newly-announced initiative will help. What the Competition Authority says, what the financial regulator says and what the Central Bank does in making sure we have good functioning, good governance and a competitive industry should be supported.</P>
      <P>I pointed out our involvement in a reassessment of the strategies for the international banks which will be ready in the middle of the summer. It has been focused on my Department and will hopefully drive more progress in the industry. It is not just a question of bottom line profits. The banking industry gives a great deal of quality employment. It should stick by good business practice and charge accordingly, but most of my comments on the day were focused on the international banks.</P>

	<P>I join colleagues in expressing my sincerest sympathy to the bereaved family following the Clara school bus tragedy this morning and to the teaching staff and fellow pupils of the young boy who lost his life. I also extend good wishes for a full recovery to all the injured students involved in that accident. It is appropriate that all of us, not just those in this House, who can make a contribution, should renew their commitment to work together to avoid such tragedies where at all possible in the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about a matter of national importance. Was a decision taken at this <Col N="1118"/>morning&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting to proceed with the privatisation of Aer Lingus, our national airline, by floating it on the Stock Exchange? Is the Taoiseach at all aware of concern not only among current and former Aer Lingus staff but among the wider community at the prospect of selling off a strategic interest, our national airline? Is the Taoiseach aware that many local authorities, including his own, Dublin City Council &mdash; and Cork and Limerick city councils &mdash; have all passed resolutions opposing the proposition to proceed with the privatisation of Aer Lingus? That is indicative of the extent of the wider public concern, with support from across the political spectrum. The Taoiseach is aware that SIPTU members have overwhelmingly voted to serve protective notice in the event of the proposal to sell off the national airline without agreement on key issues such as job security and pensions. I am sure the Taoiseach has noted that union remains firmly opposed to the proposal to privatise Aer Lingus, both in terms of its strategic position within the overall economic interests of the country, and its future.</P>
      <P>The ICTU has asked the Government to revisit its refusal to invest in the national airline and to acknowledge that investment in a profitable State company is not debarred by EU law. The Government was also asked to address the ICTU proposal for a State holding company for all State enterprises. This proposal deserves serious consideration. Will the Taoiseach revisit the proposition put forward by the ICTU, which has wide support, and hold off on any further decision on Aer Lingus, irrespective of what decision the Cabinet has made this morning, until the Taoiseach has seriously considered the alternatives which others have presented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to these issues in response to the social partnership questions earlier.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport has been engaging in lengthy discussions with the trade unions and will continue to talk to them to address these concerns. Last May, we decided to allow the sale of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus in order to receive an equity injection into the company while retaining a significant stake in it, to protect the State&rsquo;s key strategic interests. The Government authorised the Ministers of Transport and Finance to commence arrangements to facilitate the investment transaction, including the appointment of advisers to make recommendations on the nature, scale and timing of that transaction, which was phase one of the project, as well as the advice on the implementation of a selected transaction mechanism, which is phase two of the work. The advisers to the Ministers of Transport and Finance produced a report on the nature, scale and timing last December, and over the past four months the Ministers have considered all the recommendations made and engaged with the <Col N="1119"/>trade unions on the issue. The Government is going ahead with this.</P>
      <P>This is good news for the airline, its staff and customers and for the broad economy. The transaction will give Aer Lingus access to the broadest range of funding available in the financial markets. It will also enhance the company&rsquo;s financial strength and give it the commercial flexibility necessary to compete and win in one of the world&rsquo;s most dynamic industries. It will allow Aer Lingus to implement its ambitious business plan and see the long-haul fleet doubling in the short term. The fleet will grow by more than 55% in the next five years, with clear positive implications for the numbers employed in the airline. It will lead to a significant increase in the airline&rsquo;s global reach and thus enhance international access to Ireland for inward investment. It will significantly broaden the level of choice for Irish customers and improve international linkages for domestic business, and enhance our competitiveness as a modern country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has not confirmed if the Cabinet has taken its decision but we can presume it was taken at this morning&rsquo;s meeting. The Taoiseach has not responded to any of the questions I put to him with regards to the ICTU proposition which clearly merits serious consideration, which it has not received heretofore. The Joint Committee on Transport is due to meet to discuss the serious issue of Aer Lingus this Thursday. Why did the Cabinet proceed prior to this important engagement? Is this not indicative, yet again, of a total absence of respect for democratic accountability and consultation? Clearly, that has not happened. The Government has proceeded without the benefit of that further discussion within a committee of the Houses.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree with the majority of the people that the privatisation of Eircom, our telecommunications network, was an unmitigated disaster? Is it not the case that a number of spokespersons from the Government Front Bench have indicated that with the benefit of hindsight &mdash; it is a pity it always comes with hindsight to them &mdash; this was not perhaps the wisest move to have taken? Is it the case that despite this, the same international banker has been engaged to advise on the proposed Aer Lingus privatisation as was engaged in regard to the Eircom debacle? Can we not presume that the very same will happen to Aer Lingus whereby it will be thrown to the wolves, as was the case with Eircom, with very little return to the State, a bleak future for the workforce and a profitable national airline broken up for onward sale and set-aside?</P>
      <P>At this eleventh hour, will the Taoiseach respond to an appeal to pull back from the brink on this proposition, recognising the historic reality of previous sell-offs of major key infrastructural elements within our overall economic <Col N="1120"/>condition? We appeal to him to pull back from the brink and to examine further all the other salient and important options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that before the decision was taken last year the Cabinet had spent approximately two years in advance discussing the various options and going through the detail. That has continued during the past 12 months. The Minister has also advised Government of the outcome of the consultations with the trade unions.</P>
      <P>Understandably trade unions have a number of concerns they wish to see addressed, including issues of job security and pensions. The Minister is doing everything he can to try to resolve these. The Ministers for Transport and Finance will mandate the management in Aer Lingus to engage with the trade unions with a view to resolving the issues identified by them. I am confident that through this process a way forward can be found that will allow the staffs&rsquo; interests to be addressed to the maximum extent possible while also positioning the airline for growth.</P>
      <P>The decision the Cabinet has reached on the future of the company will give it certainty in regard to the future funding it needs to flourish in what is an increasingly competitive global aviation market. As I said earlier, if we want Aer Lingus to have access to broad funding to enhance its strength and allow it to implement its business plan, this is the way we must go and the way the Government has agreed to go.</P>

The evaluation of the national missing persons helpline by Kevin Lawlor and Callus Pope in December 2003 made 12 recommendations not only highlighting the importance of the helpline but also recommending that its funding be continued and services increased and expanded. However, the aspect of the report on which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, focused on in his rationale for withdrawing funding was the number of calls made between October 2002 and October 2003 without consideration of the need for a dedicated advertising budget and strategy. It is appalling there is no such service for those affected. I urge the Minister to recommence the funding of the missing persons helpline and to implement fully the recommendations of the evaluation report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
      <P LI="1">That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the order of the D&aacute;il of 18 June 2002, to the extent that it orders that the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 be considered in committee of the whole D&aacute;il, be discharged and that the Bill be withdrawn.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">As Members will recall, the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 was the subject of a Private Members debate in this House on 7 and 8 March last. During the course of the three hour debate, my colleague, Deputy Martin, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and l both outlined in detail to the House the steps the Government had taken since 1999 on Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s Private Members Bill from June 1999. I take this opportunity to advise the House yet again of these steps and the reasons the Government is withdrawing the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 from the Order Paper of this House and addressing the important and sensitive issue of whistleblowing on a sectoral basis in the future.</P>
      <P>The Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 was introduced in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Rabbitte on 24 March 1999. The Government, at its meeting on 15 June 1999, decided to &ldquo;accept the Bill, in principle, at Second Stage, subject to indicating to <Col N="1128"/>Deputy Rabbitte that amendments will be proposed at Committee Stage by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment following consultations with the interested parties and following on the advice of the Attorney General.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Arising from that, my colleague, the Government Chief Whip and the then Minister of State with responsibility for labour, trade and consumer affairs, Deputy Kitt, announced in the D&aacute;il on 15 June 1999 that he fully supported any meaningful measures to increase the protection of workers and, therefore, would not oppose the referral of the Bill to committee. He also indicated that many of the provisions of the Bill would have to be examined more closely and would necessitate further consultations with the social partners and other interested bodies. The Bill passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 16 June 1999 and was referred to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.</P>
      <P>In July 2000, following examination of the Bill, the Department, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, circulated a draft memorandum for Government to all Departments. As a follow-on from observations received from Departments, a total of 45 amendments were prepared by the Department. The proposed amendments, if adopted, would have resulted in more comprehensive legislation, which would provide protection from civil liability or penalisation during their employment for employees, including agency workers, who make &mdash; to the specified persons or appropriate officers of public bodies, so designated for the purposes of the Bill &mdash; certain protected disclosures of information obtained in the course of their employment, as distinct from making certain disclosures about the conduct of the business and affairs of their employers.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 27 July 2001, the Government approved the re-drafting and amending of the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 on the lines of the 45 draft amendments, subject to further consideration being given to the implications for the Central Bank and related issues and the breadth of the grounds, in terms of future behaviour, on which the terms of the Bill could be invoked. The Government amendments raised a number of detailed and complex issues which, according to the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, would require substantial re-drafting of the Bill.</P>
      <P>These related to issues such as the inclusion of the Central Bank under the Bill. Clarifications were sought that the terms &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo; did not include the Central Bank and its staff, the issue being that the bank&rsquo;s confidentiality regime was derived from obligations regarding professional secrecy imposed under EU law. It would be necessary to avoid any possible conflict with the Central Bank Acts and/or EU law, as a series of legal advices were received from senior counsel and the Attorney General&rsquo;s <Col N="1129"/>office which indicated inconsistencies with certain EU commitments relating to conditions for the disclosure of information.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There was also the issue of the provision of the protections of the Bill to public servants. In particular, issues arose relating to the operation of the Official Secrets Act 1963. In 2002, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel subsequently indicated that the proposed Government amendments would need further consultations, particularly with regard to: the protection of trade-secret type industrial processes, particularly where they overlap with intellectual property rights, as the Bill should not create a grey area between what matters are to be included in &ldquo;whistleblowing&rdquo; and the protection of such intellectual property rights; clarification of the nature of the protections that would be required under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 1993, to employees who &ldquo;whistleblow&rdquo; reasonably and in good faith; and the Official Secrets Act 1963.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office also provided further complex legal advice relating to the obligations on designated bodies and the Central Bank of Ireland to report certain suspected money laundering activities to the Revenue Commissioners. Further progress on re-drafting the Bill was overtaken by the dissolution of the D&aacute;il in April 2002 and the general election in May 2002. The Government decided in June 2002 to restore to the D&aacute;il Order Paper the 1999 draft Bill as part of a number of draft legislative measures circulated by the Chief Whip on 10 June 2002. This was achieved on foot of a motion taken in the House on 18 June 2002. The Bill was placed on the Order Paper of the House and became part of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, which is a commitment to legislate.</P>
      <P>Progress on the re-drafting of the Bill was raised on a number of occasions in the House, either on the Order of Business or in a number of parliamentary questions. In addition, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s private office wrote to Deputy Howlin on 5 February 2003. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s private office also contacted Deputy Howlin on the issue on 21 November 2003.</P>
      <P>ln light of the complexities encountered, the possibility of continuing to address the issue on a sectoral basis was looked into as such an approach began to look more effective and practical. Following consideration, this approach was conveyed to the House on the Order of Business on 19 May 2004 by the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, who stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is now considered, on reflection, that the provision of statutory protection for whistleblowers on a sectoral basis might provide a better and more focused approach to dealing with this issue as in the case of section 4 of the Protection for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act and section 50 of the Competition Act. ln such circumstances, proceeding with the 1999 Bill is not viewed as a priority. The matter may <Col N="1130"/>be addressed at some future time when priorities in terms of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme have been implemented.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The approach &mdash; that Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s Bill was no longer a Government priority &mdash; was repeated by the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on 2 November 2004 when he stated: &ldquo;In such circumstances, proceeding with the 1999 Bill, as it is five years old, is not viewed as a priority. It may be addressed at some future time when the priorities of the legislative programme will be implemented&rdquo;.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The sectoral approach was also repeated on a number of occasions during 2004 either on the Order of Business or in replies to a number of parliamentary questions in the House. Throughout this period, the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 continued to be retained on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme. However, in the light of further exchanges on the Order of Business on 15, 16 and 30 June and on 1 July 2005, and in replies given to parliamentary questions on the issue on 28 September 2005, 2 November 2005 and 6 December 2005, the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I believed that it was necessary to bring clarity to this issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Over recent months, we have both been giving consideration to formalising a sectoral approach to the issue of &ldquo;whistleblowing&rdquo;. I will again outline to the House what I mean by this and why I believe it is the best approach. A sectoral approach will enable the speedier introduction of relevant measures, appropriate to different sectors, to address the important issues identified in Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s original Bill. However, as already indicated, the extensive work on preparing official amendments to the Private Members' Bill raised a number of complex legal questions relating to: inclusion of the Central Bank having regard to the bank&rsquo;s confidentiality regime; the obligation on designated bodies and the Central Bank of Ireland to report certain suspected money laundering to the Revenue Commissioners; the Official Secrets Act 1963 and its implications for civil servants; and the protection of trade-secret type industrial processes. A single all-encompassing legislative proposal on &ldquo;whistleblowing&rdquo; would be complex and cumbersome, take considerable time to enact and would not be user friendly to the general public.</P>
      <P>The benefits of the suggested sectoral approach can be evidenced by legislative developments in the period since Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s Bill of 1999. The issues raised in the context of the original Bill are so important as not to allow for postponement until perfect and comprehensive legislation can be devised. Accordingly, both the Minister, Deputy Martin and I, as well as our ministerial colleagues have been availing of opportunities to include a suitable &ldquo;whistleblowing&rdquo; provision in draft legislation, where appropriate. As indicated earlier, while still seeking to solve drafting problems in the original Bill, the <Col N="1131"/>Government included suitable provisions in a series of legislative measures adopted by the House in recent years. These legislative measures were the subject of lengthy discussions during their passage through the Houses, during which the Opposition would have had the opportunity to raise any concerns its Members might have had about workers who might want to &rsquo;&rsquo;whistleblow&rsquo;&rsquo; in good faith.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 provides immunity from civil liability to persons who report child abuse reasonably and in good faith. Under the Ethics in Public Office Act 2001, the Standards in Public Office Commission is empowered to investigate complaints about alleged contraventions of the Ethics in Public Office Act.</P>
      <P>As far as complaints are made, <i>inter alia</i>, by civil servants, against other civil servants, the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 to 2001 provide at section 5(1) that &ldquo;where a person makes a complaint to the Commission in good faith, no cause of action shall lie against the person and no disciplinary action shall be taken against him or her as a result of reporting his or her concerns to the Commission&rdquo;. Section 5(4) provides that a person who takes disciplinary action against a complainant in this context will be guilty of an offence and liable to a substantial fine.</P>
      <P>Section 50 of the Competition Act 2002 provides that a person shall not be liable for damages in respect of the communication, whether in writing or otherwise, by him or her to the Competition Authority. The 2002 Act also provides that an employer shall not penalise an employee for having formed an opinion of the kind referred to in section 50(1) of the Act and communicated it, whether in writing or otherwise, to the authority if the employee has acted reasonably and in good faith in forming that opinion and communicating it to the authority.</P>
      <P>Section 27 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 provides for protection against dismissal and penalisation of employees who, in good faith, take steps to protect themselves or others in a workplace situation.</P>
      <P>Section 124 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for regulations providing for the establishment of a charter containing guidelines and mechanisms to enable members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other persons to report in confidence allegations of corruption and malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Government decided on 7 March 2006 to formalise the sectoral approach as part of its policy on addressing the issue of whistleblowing by requiring Ministers, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, with legislation either on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme for the current Oireachtas session or currently in the course of preparation to include, where appropriate, whistleblowing provisions <Col N="1132"/>therein. Such an approach also acknowledges situations where the provision of whistleblowing provisions may not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the Government decision and as part of continuing this sectoral approach, I moved a Government amendment on Committee Stage of the Employment Permits Bill 2005 on Thursday, 9 March, to include a new section 25, entitled &ldquo;Penalisation of Employees&rdquo;, to provide for whistleblowing provisions in that Bill. This amendment provides important protections to employees from overseas who act to report wrongdoing by employers to either a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Minister in respect of the new Act or the earlier Employment Permits Act 2003. The amendment is along the lines of the provisions of previous sectoral legislation as outlined earlier and was agreed without discussion.</P>
      <P>I have attempted to give the House some flavour of the exceptional legal difficulties encountered in seeking to give legislative effect to the provisions in the original Bill. I have no reason to believe that these problems can be satisfactorily resolved in the near future, despite the existence of goodwill and hard work on all sides.</P>
      <P>The important issues that gave rise to Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s original proposal have not diminished in relevance. While appropriate provisions to address these issues will continue to be included in a number of statutes, there can be no sense of complacency. It is imperative that we continue to ensure that persons providing sensitive information in the public interest are provided with appropriate safeguards.</P>
      <P>As the House considers each Bill that comes before it, it will have an opportunity to decide on the whistleblowing safeguards most appropriate to different sectors and to the particular needs of persons working therein. The sectoral approach also means that future measures in this area will be informed by the experience of earlier measures already on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>All Deputies have a role to play in this regard and the Government will certainly be prepared to consider contributions to this end from all sides of the House. I am convinced that the sectoral approach offers the best prospect of effectively addressing these important issues in a timely and effective manner.</P>
      <P>Against this background and on behalf of the Government, I ask the House to support it in its decisions to proceed on a case-by-case basis with appropriate whistleblowing provisions, as either enacted by the House or currently before it, rather than await the possible resolution of wider complex legal issues. I also ask the House to note that the Government&rsquo;s approach will continue to provide a series of opportunities for Members to contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate whistleblower provisions on a sectoral basis. Finally, I ask the House to endorse the Government&rsquo;s intention to continue to pursue the sectoral approach which will supersede the <Col N="1133"/>all-encompassing approach proposed in Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill of 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the sectoral approach, I commend the motion to the House that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the order of the D&aacute;il of 18 June 2002, to the extent that it orders that the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 be considered in Committee of the whole D&aacute;il, be discharged and that the Bill be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael, I thank the Labour Party for its exemplary Whistleblowers Bill, which was supported by my party. We are pleased that the Government accepts the need for this legislation.</P>
      <P>I hardly need to present any evidence to the House on the need for whistleblower legislation because the matter has been in the public domain for such a long time. Dodgy deals in high places, corrupt officials with too much power and shady goings-on in our most trusted institutions are common revelations in the media. During previous debates on this legislation, Fine Gael made the point that it should include some supports for employees to obtain confidential legal advice as to whether they should proceed further with complaints. It would be better if an employee could be guaranteed that a complaint had substance by obtaining advice from a third party.</P>
      <P>Other jurisdictions have whistleblower hotlines that people may contact to state that they are working in a company where something is happening about which they are concerned and ask whether they should go further with their complaint. These supports should be available throughout the entire whistleblower process. There is no point in passing this type of legislation if employees are left hanging.</P>
      <P>We pointed out that employees were to be defined in the same way as in the 1984 Act. This would exclude many people, including students. If a student in a third level institution discovered something radically wrong, would he or she be protected? This aspect is covered in the equivalent British legislation and we should examine it.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to recent scandals in financial institutions. Although not a matter of life and death, revelations of sharp practices, overcharging and daylight robbery by banks brought shame and disgrace to the industry. These revelations, however, were vital to ensuring that trust could be restored and that consumers obtain a fair deal. Both AIB and National Irish Bank were the centre of these revelations. National Irish Bank was in the spotlight for a litany of difficulties, ranging from overcharging customers to assisting them in evading tax. AIB, our largest financial institution, issued three reports detailing how it overcharged customers in a range of areas by more than &euro;34 million.</P>
      <P>What occurred in that financial institution is amazing. The currency converter machines used by bank staff to calculate transactions had been adjusted to reduce the rate of commission <Col N="1134"/>charged, from one percentage point to 0.5 of a percentage point, in the days before what was then IFSRA contacted the bank. <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that the bank confirmed that staff working on the foreign exchange counters were not informed why the machines were being altered. Had the error not been made public, it is likely customers would never have known that they had been overcharged. The Irish Bank Officials Association said at the time that its members were demoralised and disgusted to learn of what took place.</P>
      <P>The revelations of wrongdoing at AIB and NIB were brought to public attention by staff who decided to report them. Staff in both banks felt unable to raise such matters within their organisations and sought to bring attention to them through the media or the regulator. The IBOA general secretary, Mr. Larry Broderick, told the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that bank employees work in a culture of fear and are frightened of speaking out on any issue because they are concerned that it will damage their career prospects. What has the Government to say to them now? What will it say to the thousands of bank workers who leave their jobs every year, jobs once considered safe and well paid?</P>
      <P>It is not only financial institutions that have been at fault. The Government gave us PPARS, on which a loyal citizen and worker blew the lid. A whistleblower in the HSE was approached last year and entrusted with the task of telling the nation of the PPARS scandal, which cost taxpayers &euro;160 million and which still does not work.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Today we heard details of another scandal relating to the smart card for travellers. Some &euro;16 million has gone to waste to develop an integrated ticket for public transport. I understand that the computer software programme developed for this project must now be scrapped. A sum of &euro;9.5 million went to waste on investigating a smart card system for the Luas and now we hear that a further &euro;16 million has gone down the tube. Numerous people, organisations and issues of concern could be dealt with if that money was available to them.</P>
      <P>We recently debated the dreadful impact of the actions of Dr. Neary in Drogheda. The culture of pressure and secrecy and employees&rsquo; fear of damaging their prospects, as exposed by the Neary affair, is endemic in many hospitals. It is an issue that must be dealt with so that people who are concerned about services, activities, procedures or other issues relating to patient safety can expose difficulties. Of course, protection must be provided to ensure that nobody is incorrectly or mischievously named in connection with any difficulty. We must ensure the accuracy of statements.</P>
      <P>Who knows how much earlier the rank corruption at local government level would have been revealed had whistleblowers protection been in place? Fine Gael implores the Government to <Col N="1135"/>pass this legislation as soon as possible. My party will not delay the legislation but reserves the right to offer its suggestions on improvements to it. Fine Gael thanks and congratulates the Labour Party and Deputy Rabbitte for the work they have done in bringing this issue forward and will be pleased to continue to support them in the passing of this Bill. I am glad that the Government has decided to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government motion seeks the discharge of an earlier order of the D&aacute;il for the consideration of the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 in committee of the whole D&aacute;il and it seeks to direct that the Bill be withdrawn. The motion is shameful but not unexpected. In fact, like every other aspect of the Government&rsquo;s approach to this affair, its timing is dilatory, tortuous and drawn out.</P>
      <P>The timetable, as a whole, stretches over more than six and a half years, as traced by the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen. On 15 June 1999, the then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, gave the official Government line on my Bill. He said, &ldquo;I fully support any meaningful measures to increase the protection of workers and, therefore, I will not oppose the reference of this Bill to a committee&rdquo; and added, &ldquo;Good employers, however, who respect the practice of information and consultation with their workers need have no fear from the implementation of the measures envisaged in the Bill&rdquo;. Deputy Kitt concluded by stating:</P>
      <P LI="1">As regards future actions, it would be useful if I and my officials could maintain regular contact with Deputy Rabbitte with a view to co-operating to ensure that the resultant Bill contains the best legislative proposals that can be put in place to protect persons from retaliation by their employers for reporting dubious practices to the appropriate authorities.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I confirm to the House what I stated previously, namely, that Deputy Kitt&rsquo;s words were meaningless and empty. Neither he, his then senior Minister &mdash; the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney &mdash; their successors nor any of their officials maintained any sort of contact with me, regular or otherwise, in respect of this Bill from that day to this.</P>
      <P>The then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, concluded the debate by saying, &ldquo;The Government is committed to the maximum co-operation on this Bill to ensure we have the best possible legislation on this important issue&rdquo;. The Bill was immediately sent to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business but the proceedings thereof were delayed to give the T&aacute;naiste time to consider the Bill in detail and to propose any necessary amendments. This was understandable and we waited in patience for the results of her deliberations.</P><Col N="1136"/>
      <P>In the interim, various bodies, including among others the Irish Nurses Organisation, the Irish Bank Officials Association and the Irish Airline Pilots Association, called for comprehensive statutory protection for whistleblowers. Those calls increased dramatically in the aftermath of the publication of the Lourdes Hospital inquiry report. In addition, the Standards in Public Office Commission recommended that a whistleblowers&rsquo; charter be introduced for local government employees. Various Ministers and the Taoiseach continued to give the impression that work was ongoing to strengthen and improve the Bill.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In March 2000, the then Minister for Finance told the D&aacute;il, in a statement on the Committee of Public Accounts report on the DIRT inquiry, that a scheme and procedure for bank officials to report suspected wrongdoing would be introduced by way of amendments to the Whistleblowers Protection Bill.</P>
      <P>In December 2000, the Taoiseach, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> setting out his Government&rsquo;s proposals for a package of measures to combat corruption, wrote:</P>
      <P LI="1">I am announcing a set of proposals which meet the need for modernisation and transparency, while at the same time allowing for the continuing development of a fully inclusive and dynamic body politic. These proposals include the introduction of legislation to protect whistleblowers.</P>
      <P FLI="0">In the following sentence, however, he also announced the introduction of legislation to regulate lobbyists. We are still awaiting any action from the Government on that issue, even though my colleague, Deputy Quinn, introduced a Bill on the matter in July of 1999.</P>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated repeatedly that extensive amendments were being prepared, based on consultations with all Departments. To the best of my knowledge, this evening is the first time we have heard about the 45 amendments that were prepared. It implies that the Bill entirely passed muster with the Department, which set out to make the legislation more comprehensive by framing the 45 amendments to which the Minister of State referred. Presumably the change of heart is entirely due to a change of political will on the part of the Government to proceed with the Bill. I do not accept all of the talk about the complexity of the advice from the Attorney General. The Bill and the amendments clearly went through the Parliamentary Counsel and might have been enacted if the political will to do so had been in existence.</P>
      <P>Although the Bill lapsed on the dissolution of the 28th D&aacute;il, it was restored to the Order Paper by the Government following the general election. The Bill also had supporters in the high level group on regulation and on the Government back benches. As recently as last June, Deputy Fleming produced a report from the Joint Com<Col N="1137"/>mittee on Finance and the Public Service on commercial bank charges and interest rates, stating that those engaged in whistleblowing should receive statutory protection and recommending that the Bill should be progressed.</P>
      <P>The truth is that the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste systematically misled the D&aacute;il regarding the reasons the Government has blocked further progress on the Bill. When it became obvious that progress was being blocked, I continually questioned the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance on the Order of Business. I was told by each that significant legal and constitutional issues had arisen and, eventually, that the legal advice was that the Government should not proceed with the Bill.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from me in June of last year, the sixth anniversary of the passing of Second Stage, the T&aacute;naiste informed me she would ask the line Minister to furnish me with the legal advice. When I still had not received the promised legal advice, I again raised the matter with the T&aacute;naiste and she was forced to admit there was no such advice.</P>
      <P>She said it was not actually the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice but official advice on the difficulties that would arise if the whistleblowing legislation applied to companies outside Ireland with a subsidiary in Ireland. I see no mention of that in the list of complexities that are bewildering the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen.</P>
      <P>We know the D&aacute;il has been systematically misled by the most senior members of the Government. The real reason the Government reversed engines and decided not to proceed with important legislation which it supported on Second Stage is that it was afraid it might offend the multinationals. The multinational companies have extensive practical experience of dealing with whistleblower legislation in many countries in the western world. From this, they learned to live quite comfortably with it. If they can persuade the Government to impose much poorer standards of corporate governance than they are used to elsewhere, they would be foolish not to throw their weight around.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my Bill was to challenge and help transform the traditional culture of secrecy surrounding the conduct of business and public affairs. From the Blood Transfusion Service to the beef industry, whether it is Army deafness or Dublin planning or, more recently and most devastatingly, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital&rsquo;s maternity wing, the questions are the same. Did nobody know or suspect? Is it credible that nobody in the system ever stumbled across wrongdoing? Why was nothing reported earlier?</P>
      <P>As regards illegality and malpractice in our financial institutions, did nobody in these institutions know what was going on? In answer to these questions most right-thinking people will believe people knew or had their suspicions. <Col N="1138"/>However, the consequences for whistleblowers, in their careers and livelihoods, are such that it is often easier to turn a blind eye.</P>
      <P>My Bill proposed a set of new statutory rights for employees, whether in the public or the private sector, to report and transmit information they receive of illegality or malpractice discovered in the course of their employment. I believe this is an essential step to restoring confidence in our major institutions, whether industrial, financial or governmental.</P>
      <P>Under my Bill, any employee who blows the whistle on fraud or malpractice will be entitled to protection against dismissal or any other sanction which his or her employer attempts to impose. These rights are essential if we are serious about ending the nod and wink culture that permeates certain sectors of business and public life. Events of recent years have demonstrated the current legal position actively discourages individuals from reporting what they believe to be serious offences or major failings on the part of their employers, many of which have public interest implications.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on the State to ensure individuals who provide such information are not victimised or discriminated against in the wake of their disclosures. This is an employment protection and public interest Bill, designed to secure rights for any worker, whether on a F&Aacute;S course, working in a hospital, a blood bank, a shopping store, a beef factory, a financial institution or a Department to refuse to be complicit with improper decisions taken by his or her management superiors.</P>
      <P>There is genuine concern at the failure of our regulatory institutions, such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank, to crack down on glaring abuses of the system. I share the concern but the Government does not. The Bill is firmly in line with the Labour Party&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to openness, transparency and accountability. That commitment produced the Freedom of Information Act, the Ethics in Public Office Act and the reforms to our Electoral Acts governing disclosure of donations and expenses at elections and capping expenditure at all elections. However, due to the legislative back-pedalling of the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, it does not apply to local elections.</P>
      <P>The evidence of its years in office has persuaded me the Government fears the concepts of openness, transparency and accountability almost as much as it despises them. It knows it must pay lip-service but its impulse is to renege, to side-step, to prevaricate and to dissemble.</P>
      <P>Developments may take place in other countries and reforms may sweep through the most hidebound and bloated of international institutions. Yet the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il see no need to change the way we do business. This is despite the bleatings of the <Col N="1139"/>Progressive Democrats when they were on this side of the House.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11- ?>
      <P>Ominously, on the day I introduced the Bill, the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, compared the Whistleblowers Protection Bill in importance to the Freedom of Information Act, which he described as &ldquo;the most far-reaching legislation as regards dealing with the public sector&rdquo; and which &ldquo;marked an important first step towards a new era of openness in Government and in public affairs&rdquo;. He described my Bill as contributing further to the culture of openness and transparency.</P>
      <P>We know what the Government did to the Freedom of Information Act, once it got tired of its temporary little commitment to openness, transparency and accountability. The Freedom of Information Act was introduced by the rainbow Government to ensure greater openness and to guarantee access to information to which the public is entitled. Fianna F&aacute;il was always unhappy with this approach and it wasted little time in introducing legislation designed to undermine the original Act.</P>
      <P>Despite having no mandate to do so and never having raised the matter in either party&rsquo;s election manifesto, the Government introduced amending legislation in 2003 which excluded whole areas of information to which the public had been entitled under the original Act. It then followed this with massive increases in charges for applications under the Act. The whole impact of this has been to seriously undermine the value of the original legislation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It now seems clear that accepting the Whistleblowers Protection Bill on Second Stage was preferable to the embarrassment of voting it down. There was never any intention of implementing it. Better simply to put on an outward show of agreement and then send the issue to a departmental committee where it would die of old age. Although the 1999 Bill probably holds some form of parliamentary record as the longest standing Bill on the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s Order Paper, it will take a change of Government to see it passed into law.</P>
      <P>We are ready for that eventuality. One way or the other, the Bill will pass into law. The Labour Party, when in Government, is committed to restoring and enacting the Whistleblowers Protection Bill. We are also committed to a return to the highest possible standards in regard to access to official information. We will repeal the Government&rsquo;s wrecking amendments to that legislation and restore and improve upon the original Freedom of Information Act.</P>

	<P>That we are debating a motion for the withdrawal of the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 is both disappointing and unwelcome. Public interest disclosure legislation, more commonly known as whistleblowers protection legislation, is a key element within workers&rsquo; rights protections. It is essential to prevent the dismissal or victimisation of workers who come forward and disclose information in the public good.</P>
      <P>In the Six Counties, the Public Interest Disclosure (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 provides protection for workers who are dismissed or victimised as a result of making certain disclosures regarding their employers&rsquo; activities. The information disclosed must relate to a criminal offence, a failure to comply with a legal obligation, a miscarriage of justice, a health and safety issue, damage to the environment or an attempt cover up any of the above.</P>
      <P>The importance of whistleblower protections cannot be underestimated. Whistleblowing can inform those who need to know about health and safety risks, potential environmental problems, fraud, corruption, deficiencies in the care of vulnerable people, cover-ups and many other problems. Frequently it is only through whistleblowing that this information can come to light and be addressed before real damage is done.</P>
      <P>We can only surmise what suffering would have been prevented for the victims of Michael Neary if such legislation was in place. Would the corruption in planning, endemic in Dublin in particular, have persisted as long as it did leaving us with a legacy of poorly planned sprawling estates and colossal tribunal bills? Would the infection of women with hepatitis C and haemophiliacs with hepatitis and HIV have been stopped before so many people were infected? Although we will never know the answers to these questions, we can ensure such situations do not occur again by putting in place comprehensive whistleblowing protection legislation.</P>
      <P>Whistleblowing is a valuable activity which can positively influence all our lives. The Government and the people will regret the decision to dump the legislation and deal with the issue in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.</P>
      <P>It seems more than a little odd that the Government is claiming legal difficulties given similar legislation has been enacted in other jurisdictions which have similar legal systems. How is it possible to enact such legislation in the North and in Britain and not come up against the problems which this Government is using as an excuse to dump this Bill?</P>
      <P>Are there not lessons the Government can learn from legislation existing in other states thereby overcoming the difficulties which the Government claims it is facing with certain EU commitments in respect of conditions for the disclosure of information and the problems of trade secrets and intellectual property rights?</P>
      <P>It is simply not true to say it is more effective to address this on a sectoral basis and to say that <Col N="1141"/>while some workers may be given protections others will have to wait. It is nonsense to say it will result in the speedier introduction of relevant measures appropriate to different sectors. How long will it take to complete the process of introducing whistleblowers&rsquo; protections on a sectoral basis? I contend it will probably take years if it is to be completed at all.</P>
      <P>There are undoubtedly many cases where information that would be in the public interest is not revealed because individual workers justifiably fear penalization by their employer in the absence of measures to protect them. We must empower workers to come forward in the public interest to reveal information regarding threats to health and safety, the environment, incidences of fraud and corruption and other unacceptable activities. This is patently in all our interests.</P>
      <P>I wish to record my opposition to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion is before us as a result of an instruction from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to the Chief Whip, Deputy Kitt, to withdraw the Whilstleblowers Protection Bill 1999. This has come about as a result of the Government&rsquo;s decision to take a sectoral approach to whistleblowers rather than a holistic one, as envisaged under the terms of the 1999 Bill as introduced by the Labour Party. It is extraordinary that it has taken seven years for the Government to take any action on this Bill. It is regrettable the action it took was to seek the measure&rsquo;s withdrawal. This is despite several Ministers having indicated at various stages that they were supportive of the 1999 Bill.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was introduced in 1999, the then Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, said he fully supported any meaningful measures to increase the protection of workers and, therefore, would not be opposing the Bill&rsquo;s referral to committee. The measure has made no progress since then, however.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the Government approved the redrafting of the Bill but nothing was produced by the Government. As far back as two years ago, the first reference to addressing the issue on a sectoral basis was made by the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith. Nothing else happened until a few weeks ago when a relevant motion came before the House. At that time, the Minister, Deputy Martin, made a declaration instructing the Chief Whip to withdraw the Bill. That is the sum total of the Government&rsquo;s contribution to ensuring employees have statutory protection in the event of blowing the whistle on wrong doing in society.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s efforts amount to nothing and that is regrettable, particularly when so much wrongdoing is being engaged in. Much of that wrongdoing could have been prevented if the Government had acted either by introducing its own Bill or by amending the Labour Party Bill, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1142"/>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is regrettable this legislation is being withdrawn. I suggest the sectoral approach which is being taken could be better described as a piecemeal approach to our legislation. The goal of any good whistleblower legislation should be to promote a society in which it is possible to speak out about corruption, public dangers and other vital social issues, without fear of reprisal.</P>
      <P>Effective whistleblower protection laws would benefit the public by exposing questionable practices and institutional illegality, thus ensuring compliance with the law. Whistleblowers should be a crucial line of defence in combating crime, fraud and abuse, as well as being a crucial element of basic national security.</P>
      <P>Whistleblowers are unsung heroes who seldom get the protection they deserve. Ruined careers are often their reward. The grave need for enhanced legislation to protect whistleblowers was graphically illustrated by the scenario at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the nursing home charges debacle, the hepatitis C situation and the deaths of haemophiliacs. Those are concrete examples of where such legislation would have helped.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of the various tribunals currently in session would not have come to light without people having acted in the public interest at great personal risk. In the absence of effective overall whistleblower legislation, the proposal to remove the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999 from the Order Paper would appear to defy logic. Any legislation in this regard is better than no legislation. Amendments could have been introduced where needed to suit the circumstances. This is a missed opportunity.</P>
      <P>This Bill predates the current Government and, since 1999, has been hovering around like Banquo&rsquo;s ghost in suspended animation, as a veritable skeleton measure. It is the manifestation of a guilty conscience about our abject failure in the intervening seven years to enact effective whistleblower legislation that would provide job security and create a climate where workers would be encouraged to report problems in the workplace. We are missing an opportunity here and I regret we are moving towards a sectoral approach, which is a cop out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Green party, I am glad to return to this issue which we debated recently in Private Members&rsquo; time. As Deputy Rabbitte commented, it is interesting to note what is not being said as much as what is, particularly with reference to the speeches delivered in the earlier Private Members&rsquo; debate. The most remarkable aspect of that was the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s clear opposition to this Bill, as detailed in her speech during the previous debate, because of the concerns of multinational companies about such legislation. It rings true to me that, rather than concerns about the inclusion of the Central Bank in the Bill or the implications of the Official Secrets Act, is the reason this Bill was pulled. This has a contemporary resonance. As mere elected <Col N="1143"/>representatives of the people, we do not have any knowledge of what goes on in the partnership process but I am told a similar battle of wills or ideological divide is currently occurring in that process. We have two ideologically separate sides. The unions are seeking labour controls or supports to assure themselves that what happened at Irish Ferries could not occur elsewhere. On the other side, there is a powerful and welcome block of multinational companies who object ideologically to the concept of greater and further labour controls on their ability to do business in whatever manner. In a sense, therefore, this is a precursor for that ideological divide and it was clear where the Government stood on this decision. It went with the line of the multinational companies and said &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s kill this Bill. They don&rsquo;t like it and, therefore, it&rsquo;s not going to happen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There were high profile cases concerning Enron, Andersen Consultants and others, which might now see the merit in having a proper whistleblowing system to save the capitalist system from its own inherent weaknesses and provide some protection. We will not know, however, because the Government is not pushing it. Neither do we know where the power lies in the Government on this issue. Is it with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, or does the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, have a different position? As Deputy Rabbitte mentioned, did he put that line in about the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reasons for pulling this Bill in the Private Members&rsquo; debate? Is Fianna F&aacute;il pulling the whole Bill at the request of the watchdogs in Government, the Progressive Democrats? They are the watchdogs for the interests of multinational companies in this country. That is how I read what has happened. It is a shame because if we do not go ahead with such legislation, which would free up the workforce, the alternative process would entail having an untold number of inspectors and investigations to try to discern what is happening. Surely it is far better to liberate and empower people who might be able to tell us what is going on, free of concern about the consequences for themselves.</P>
      <P>The Government says it is approaching this matter in a piecemeal fashion but I do not see any evidence of that in the legislation that has come before the House. To take one example, the recent Fisheries (Maritime Jurisdiction) Bill dealt with an area where the real contention was a concern about illegal practices that would benefit from someone blowing the whistle. In the three days during which we debated that Bill on Committee Stage, there was no discussion about the possibility of strengthening whistleblowing legislation to provide cover in an industry where it is needed.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Government when it states it will follow a piece by piece process on this. My experience is that it will not and I do not believe such an approach by the Government will be <Col N="1144"/>effective. I join with Deputy Rabbitte in stating we should return to this issue when we are rid of the watchdogs for the multinationals opposite, the Progressive Democrats, and when Fianna F&aacute;il learn an electoral lesson from the public that we want an open and transparent sense of governance. The electorate is shocked by the scandals revealed during the past five years and is willing to support a democratic process which stitches into our everyday economic business and civic life the ability for people to tell the truth and state what is going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with considerable interest to the points made by Opposition Deputies on this motion. Both sides of the House have a commitment to address the situation but have major differences on the style in which that might be done. I can only account directly for the time in which I have been involved in the Department. I had discussions with the senior Minister on this issue during which we tried to come up with the best system to address such a major issue.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Initially, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and I believed it would be possible to introduce all-encompassing legislation which would effectively deal with the issues. However, for the reasons I outlined, that became more and more fraught. Major legislation on whistleblowers was on the side and anybody bringing through legislation could state it would be dealt with by that legislation, while others were aware of the difficulties with it and were including direct reference in their sectoral legislation.</P>
      <P>Equally strong arguments can be advanced for taking the approach proposed by Deputy Rabbitte and for taking the sectoral approach. My judgment is that it seems sensible to adopt one or the other. On the basis of the information available to me, I felt the sectoral approach stood a far better chance of being successful, because of the complications and legal issues raised and because each ministry introduces quite an amount of legislation, as Deputy Eamon Ryan stated. Opportunities were lost because some people were of the view that major legislation would be introduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville raised a number of interesting points on support for employees&rsquo; obligations. That issue was raised recently through a question to the Minister for Finance. Some interesting information emerged on what type of support people might require. Deputy Neville also mentioned the situation pertaining to students which, perhaps more than others, illustrates the need to act on a sectoral basis because each sector has different requirements. One of the difficulties which most concerned me was that all-encompassing legislation was likely to create difficulties <Col N="1145"/>in some areas and unlikely to address the peculiarities of others.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte made the reasonable point that he was promised regular contact with Ministers in this Department. To be honest, I was not aware of that commitment. Perhaps some of my predecessors were not. If I had been aware that Deputy Rabbitte wanted to have a meeting or a discussion, I certainly would have been prepared to do so.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was also promised maximum co-operation. A large amount of work was done when the view was held that this could be proceeded with on the basis of Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s Bill. Ultimately, it seemed difficult to surmount the issues raised. I did not find it was possible to address them and gradually came to the view the sectoral approach was likely to be far more successful. It was not a change of political will, it was a gradual realisation that neither the sectoral approach nor the all-encompassing approach was happening and we needed to come down on one side or the other.</P>
      <P>There is confusion about what whistleblowing provisions would achieve. While provisions in either approach would provide protection for a whistleblower, the sub-text of what some Members stated would require mandatory reporting in many circumstances. That is a different principle and may need to be addressed. However, it would not be dealt with in the context of whistleblowers, which is protection for someone who voluntarily comes forward with information to have a difficult situation addressed. Any example raised by Deputies shows there is no doubt of the need to support people who are brave enough to come forward in that regard. I believe the sectoral approach will do so far more effectively.</P>
      <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made reference to legislation in other states. We examined legislation in other states. It came down to a choice between adopting legislation for the sake of being able to state we had whistleblowers legislation or doing something that would work. Our judgment was that a sectoral approach would be more effective. In electoral, or ordinary political, terms it would be wonderful to state we adopted the whistleblowers Bill provided by Deputy Rabbitte or that we dealt with the whistleblowers issue in a comprehensive fashion so it could be taken off the electoral agenda. However, we made a judgment that the other method was likely to be more successful and that requirements in certain areas would not be met by all-encompassing legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McHugh made the point that it took seven years to reach this stage and appears to be under the impression that no work was done during that time. A considerable amount of work was done on both approaches, such as the 45 amendments to the original legislation and the provisions made in some sectoral areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connolly summarised the Opposition&rsquo;s view when he stated that any legislation is better <Col N="1146"/>than none. That is a widely held view. I strongly hold the view that legislation put through the Houses ought to be effective and deal with issues. In many circumstances, a smokescreen of some type of legislation does more harm than good.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eamon Ryan raised the point on foreign direct investment companies and multinationals, also mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte. I am not aware that was an issue at any stage in the discussions I had. I do not even remember it being mentioned. What we discussed was which approach would work best. We approached it from the view that clearly action needed to be taken as quickly as possible but in an effective manner.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Deputy Ryan also made the reasonable point that the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill did not include a whistleblowers provision. I do not know whether it would have been appropriate. I suspect it would have been. However, the chances are that the Bill was published long before the decision was made to take the sectoral approach.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties faced during the past six and a half years was that neither approach was taken as comprehensively as it should have been. One may have stated that comprehensive legislation would be put in place when Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s Bill was passed or stated that legal difficulties arose in that regard and so implemented provisions on a sectoral basis. It was not being done on either front as effectively as it might have been for that reason. It is open to Members of the House, now that the Government has made this decision and if the motion is passed, to remind each Minister at each Stage of legislation. They have been formally informed this is the Government&rsquo;s view and they ought to include it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">A number of other points were also raised on recent scandals, and opportunities arise to address these on a sectoral basis. Members are probably aware that since the Private Members&rsquo; motion on 7 and 8 March, the HSE chief executive, Professor Drumm, stated the issue of a whistleblowing provision for workers in the health sector may need to be given serious consideration. In May 2005, the Health Service Executive welcomed the Irish Nurses Organisation&rsquo;s publication of a position paper on whistleblowing and how employees may air any concerns they have about their workplace.</P>
      <P>I consulted with the Department of Health and Children and the T&aacute;naiste is well-disposed to having issues regarding disclosure of confidential information examined in the overall context of ensuring patient safety and quality of care in respect of the code of governance to be drawn up by the Health Service Executive under section 35 of the Health Act 2004, the guidance governing professional conduct issued by the professional bodies, namely, the Medical Council and Bord Altranais, and the regulatory regime for all professionals involved in health and social care.</P><Col N="1147"/>
      <P>Ultimately, the sectoral approach will require the commitment of Ministers in various Departments. It will also require the Opposition to draw attention to the fact that these issues are important and the decision to include them on a sectoral approach must be examined in the case of each Bill or, at a minimum, in the various areas <Col N="1148"/>under the control of each Department. I do not doubt from what Members stated that they will be extremely forthcoming in ensuring each Minister makes that inclusion if it is appropriate at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a road safety authority and to amend section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, which relates specifically to the implementation of the European Convention on Mutual Recognition of Driving Disqualifications. I have been advised that, in this context, it is not appropriate that this Bill be used as a means to amend the Road Traffic Acts which constitute a legal framework for the regulation of traffic, vehicles and drivers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">2.&mdash;(1) An order or regulation made pursuant to this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if either such House resolves that the order or regulation be annulled within 21 days after the order or regulation is so laid it shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder.</P><Col N="1150"/>
      <P LI="2">(2) Within 1 month from the making of an order or regulation under this Act, and without prejudice to the operation of the Statutory Instruments Act 1947, a copy of the order or regulation shall be published on the Minister&rsquo;s website and shall be delivered to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I raised this matter on Committee Stage. This amendment aims to ensure there is some formal notification process when a statutory instrument comes into operation. It is very difficult to keep track of statutory instruments. Not only should statutory instruments be put before both Houses, they should also be put on the Department of Transport&rsquo;s website. In addition, the relevant committee, in this case, the Joint Committee on Transport, should be formally notified. It is an example of good practice which should probably be applied to all legislation and I hope the Minister will agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated on Committee Stage I would consult further with the Parliamentary Counsel in respect of this amendment. I have been advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that a change in the existing provisions regarding the laying of statutory instruments can only be considered in the context of the Statutory Instruments Act 1947. I am not prepared to allow the amendment as proposed as it could have unforeseen consequences which must be carefully considered in the context of the Statutory Instruments Act 1947. One particular concern of the Parliamentary Counsel was that a statutory instrument published on a website cannot be proved in court or have judicial notice taken of it. There may also be circumstances where a statutory instrument may not be capable of being published on a website. However, in an effort to be helpful to Deputy Shortall, I am happy to give a commitment that my Department will publish statutory instruments made by me on the Department&rsquo;s website where possible. However, according to the Parliamentary Counsel, this can only be dealt with in the context of the Statutory Instruments Act 1947. It would need to be changed therein and not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to deal with one Bill. Under no circumstances would the Parliamentary Counsel accept the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it difficult to accept that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea is to facilitate the giving and sharing of information and enable people to keep abreast of changes to the law. I am not sure the Minister&rsquo;s undertaking to lay an order or regulation before the Houses where possible goes <Col N="1151"/>far enough. I would be much happier if the Minister gave a commitment to formally notify the Joint Committee on Transport of all new statutory instruments, which would be more helpful. There would be no question of misinterpretation in that instance, as it would be a matter of merely notifying the committee with an interest in the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, I did not have a problem with the amendment and gave a commitment to examine it, which I genuinely did, but the response from the Parliamentary Counsel was quite explicit. I am trying to go a bit further with the matter even though it might not have the weight of law, as it were. The Parliamentary Counsel has clearly pointed out an issue in terms of examining the Statutory Instruments Act 1947. If it is open for me to do so and there is no question of <i>imprimatur</i>, I do not have a problem with notifying the committee. The more information people have the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Hopefully, the Minister will follow through on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 5, 8 and 9 are related and will be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">4.&mdash;The Minister shall, notwithstanding the status of the Authority, remain politically accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for all matters that fall under the &aelig;gis of the Authority, and nothing in this Act shall be used to diminish the level of that responsibility or his or her accountability in that regard.</P>
      <P FLI="0">As far as I am concerned, this is the most important amendment that has been submitted during the Bill&rsquo;s progress through the Seanad and D&aacute;il. It seeks to ensure that the Minister answers parliamentary questions on the new road safety authority. This is absolutely essential. I support the legislation and the establishment of the new authority and would like to strengthen its functions. I welcomed the appointment of Mr. Noel Brett and, to the chair of the authority, Mr. Gay Byrne. However, the buck stops with the Minister. The authority is not an elected body and the Minister must be responsible to the D&aacute;il and answer questions on this body once it has been set up. No Member of the House can support a replication of the situation that arose when we established either the NRA or HSE where information became unavailable to the public or <Col N="1152"/>Deputies who represent the public. When Deputies get information in answer to parliamentary questions, it is inadequate and months after the questions have been asked. The head of the HSE, the unfortunate Professor Drumm, has become the fall guy for the Government.</P>
      <P>This is exactly what the Minister is setting up for himself. He will never need to answer another question and will be able to duck and dive as he has done successfully even when he was responsible to the D&aacute;il. The opportunities to avoid responsibility for road safety will be enormous once the Minister has handed it over to the authority and he has somebody to blame. Before entering the House, I heard the Minister on television passing blame to his officials yet again, stating he would not spend money until they sort something out. For the Minister, the buck always stops with someone else. In this case, I insist that my amendment is voted on. It is incomprehensible to the public why the D&aacute;il should pass on its responsibility to ensure the public is represented and the Minister answers its questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak to amendment No. 8, which is along the same lines as the amendments of Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Crowe. The Minister must bear in mind that he will not always be on that side of the House. I see how it might be attractive to be able to pass the buck on responsibility for various aspects of his portfolio but a time will come when the Minister will be over here looking for information and trying to establish the accountability of the Minister of the day. If the House is to remain relevant, it is critical that Deputies retain such responsibilities. As Deputy Olivia Mitchell has said, the public cannot understand why Members cannot raise issues of public concern or, for example, get answers in respect of the health area.</P>
      <P>My fear is that this new organisation will develop as a quango and we will soon find ourselves looking for answers to questions about various aspects of road safety, driver testing and so forth but receive replies to the effect that the Minister is not answerable to the D&aacute;il for the work of the road safety authority. This should not be allowed to happen. The theory that these different organisations, including the RSA, will be obliged to appear before the relevant Oireachtas committees is not good enough. In practice, it means an organisation will appear before a committee once per year at best, which would be entirely unsatisfactory in terms of getting ongoing information or challenging any aspect of the performance of the organisations. The Minister is politically accountable and should not set up an arrangement whereby he could dodge that accountability. I feel strongly that there should be no dilution of accountability.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1153"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for being late. I agree with the previous speakers. It is crucial this matter is addressed by the Minister. I understand why the Minister is establishing the authority and believe he wants it to do its work, but it is vital the Minister will respond to questions on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister is no different than other Ministers. The T&aacute;naiste refuses to answer questions relating to the HSE and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, says something or other is a matter for the board of An Post and has nothing to do with him. All of these groups are being established on the basis that there is something wrong. Clearly, we do not have our act together in terms of road safety, which I presume the Bill attempts to address, but if the Minister is not prepared to stand over those decisions and he tells Deputies that questions will be passed onto the authority, the Bill has no potential and people will not get answers, as Deputy Shortall said. It is unacceptable and takes away the powers of Deputies to ask specific and important questions of the Minister. It passes the buck and responsibility. Rather than adopting that position, the Minister must give a clear answer to his responsibility in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Deputies&rsquo; points. From my point of view, I have no wish to avoid any responsibility for the matter of road safety. I certainly would not be able to avoid it even if I wanted to. I am always happy to deal with the issue before the House.</P>
      <P>The CEO is accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the operation of the RSA. Subsections 17(15) and 17(17) of the Bill provide that the CEO will be accountable to the committees of the Oireachtas <Col N="1154"/>regarding the performance of the authority&rsquo;s functions. However, under section 9, I have the power to give general policy direction to the road safety authority and will retain overall responsibility for road safety. I am not ceding that responsibility. The Bill provides that the road safety authority may make recommendations in respect of improving driving standards and requires it to submit road safety programmes to me. In these circumstances, I consider the amendments unnecessary because they would not change anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>If nothing would be changed, I presume the Minister would not object to accepting the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter is already catered for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no sign of it being catered for in the Bill. This Bill does not state the Minister will answer parliamentary questions to, for instance, provide Members with the numbers awaiting tests and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of any Bill which specifically states that a Minister should answer parliamentary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Shortall has noted, the Minister will not be in office forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Hence, his assurances are not worth having. As something should be inserted into the Bill, I will press the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, line 18, after &ldquo;driving&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;schools and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I am seeking to ensure that the provisions in the Bill will apply not only to driving instructors but to also driving schools because there is a distinction. While a requirement of driving instructors is set down in the legislation, a way can be found to circumvent it by establishing a driving school. Such schools should be licensed or regulated in the same way as driving instructors. This point was made recently at the Joint Committee on Transport by Mr. Noel Brett who referred to the need to regulate schools as well as instructors. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have spent some time dealing with this issue. Section 4(1) provides that the road safety authority will have functions in regard to registration of instructors that will be designated in regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts. The road safety authority will be an approved body that will be able to issue instruction certificates for the purpose of regulating driving instructors. Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s proposed amendment would convey no power to regulate driving schools. It is incorrect because the subsection only refers to the functions of the road safety <Col N="1156"/>authority in accordance with the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2004. There is no power in the Road Traffic Acts to regulate driving schools.</P>
      <P>The provision in section 18 of the Road Traffic Act 1968, as amended by section 19 of the 2002 Act, is intended to regulate individuals while giving driving instruction. If driving schools were to be regulated, it would be more appropriate to provide the power to do so by way of an amendment to the Road Traffic Acts, which provide the power to regulate driving instructors. It would also require a much more extensive provision than that proposed by the Deputy. It is the quality of instruction that is important in this context and the regulation of driving schools as trading entities should be adequately covered by other legislation.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting, the driving schools indicated that the delivery of instruction by individuals is the key issue to be regulated. I agree that the quality of driving instructors is the key issue. The representatives of the schools felt that if individual instructors were registered and monitored, it would address the issue. This will happen under the road safety authority. I asked them to consider if there was any other aspect of driving schools which needed to be regulated and which was not covered by existing regulatory provisions relating to companies. They said that most driving schools were single person operations and that no other areas, other than instruction standards, <Col N="1157"/>needed to be regulated further. We have pursued this aspect specifically.</P>
      <P>I will introduce a new Bill that will revisit the issue because the legislation before us is clearly not the mechanism by which the matter can be addressed. As stated on Committee State, I am still somewhat sympathetic to the Deputy&rsquo;s view. However, we are bestowing upon the road safety authority the power to deal specifically with standards, quality, registration, certification or whatever of instructors and that is the core issue which gave rise to the legislation&rsquo;s introduction. The section in question is not the vehicle to facilitate the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion because it deals specifically with that matter and the road safety aspect. I suspect that we will revisit the matter in a couple of weeks under a new road traffic Bill, which will be the road safety Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not clear on the Minister&rsquo;s position. On one hand, he is saying the amendment is not necessary while, on the other, he is saying he could legislate for the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sympathetic to the Deputy&rsquo;s position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s initial reply was that his advice indicates that the amendment is not necessary. When the issue of road safety arose in the UK, the authorities there legislated for driving instructors and driving schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy provides me with the information, I will examine the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we will continue the debate tomorrow because it is a genuine issue which needs to be dealt with. If the Minister is giving a commitment to deal with the matter in later legislation, that is fine. I would like to debate the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>One of the major issues facing Irish society, particularly in urban areas, is how we deal with modern developments, especially multi-storey, high-rise apartment complexes. That is a significant problem around the country. The intention of this Bill is to address the significant issues involved and to put in place a regulator for the management and <Col N="1158"/>control of all apartment management companies. My colleagues will give many examples from their constituencies of houses and apartments being built but not maintained, and in appalling condition. The residents cannot deal with the issues because the management company may have gone bust, cannot be found, or is not accountable.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, this Bill is important. I am sorry the Government did not see fit to support it. The Government has failed to recognise the need for action in this area for many years. In 2002, the programme for Government stated the Government would consider the introduction of legislation to regulate the establishment and operation of apartment complex management companies. In response to a parliamentary question in May 2003, the then Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated the regulation of apartment complex management companies was &ldquo;still under consideration&rdquo; and that he had &ldquo;no immediate plans to set guidelines on fees&rdquo;. The Government motion tonight would set progress back for a further nine months, during which time we will continue to have these problems around the country.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Apartment living has become a way of life for people in recent years. As the Celtic tiger roared into life, and demographic changes put pressure on the existing housing stock, high-density apartment blocks allowed for cheaper, high quality housing that allows many young people on to the property ladder. The census of 2002 shows that more than 110,000 households, almost 9% of the total, live in apartments. This translates as more than 200,000 people, highlighting the fact that it is often single people and couples without children who reside in this type of housing. Since then, evidence suggests this trend is continuing. In the three years from 2002 to 2004, more than 42,500 flats and apartments were completed, a fifth of all new housing.</P>
      <P>This is a live issue for thousands of people. There are serious problems regarding apartment complexes throughout the country which many residents feel powerless to address. These problems relate primarily to common areas and the failure of builders and managing agents to maintain them while simultaneously charging very high management fees that increase year on year, often with little or no provision for a sinking fund that is necessary to cover the very high costs that occur every few years when major refurbishment is needed.</P>
      <P>These fees can often be higher than two months&rsquo; entire mortgage payments, and very often, residents are a total loss as to what they are paying for. Non-payment is not an option as that would lead to a debt being placed on the property that would have to be cleared before a property is sold. Residents have no State agency to complain to and with an increasing number of non-resident investors in the apartment sector, it is often difficult to spur the necessary number of residents into action. Urban councillors and <Col N="1159"/>Deputies have no shortage of horror stories regarding apartment blocks. Gardens not landscaped, unpainted walls, broken lifts, crumbling brickwork, sporadic refuse collection and broken fixtures and fittings are becoming very common. It is for this reason we are highlighting the specific issue of apartment management companies and their agents.</P>
      <P>However, I am very aware that those living in houses and housing estates, which are not apartment complexes, are also burdened with management companies and fees. I understand Fingal County Council, for example, has a significant number of planning conditions with regard to management companies managing traditional housing estates. There is great uncertainty among the community, which is being unsettled as a result, and people are very unhappy with the situation. Many of our traditional housing estates, when properly constructed by the developer, would normally be taken over and run by local authorities. However, under the current regime in some county councils, such estates will never be taken over, and those councils thus avoid their responsibilities. Clearly, there is an issue about funding those councils to ensure they can continue to maintain public open spaces, footpaths and lighting in these traditional-type housing estates when they have passed all stages and are ready to be taken over by the local authority.</P>
      <P>I have had a great deal of correspondence from solicitors, companies and people who live in housing estates, particularly around the city of Dublin. I receive an increasing number of letters, representations and e-mails in this regard. One solicitor has brought it to my attention that the Law Society construction industry contract is defective. It is in the form which was originally established for the sale of houses and in that respect has stood the test of time, but it has not been altered to deal with the sale of apartments. Because an apartment owner only owns the apartment and not the building, the contract is deficient. An apartment owner has redress against a builder if there is a defect in the apartment itself, but if there is a defect in either the internal or external common areas, or if there is likely to be a defect in the structural parts which will not manifest itself for some time, the apartment owner has no redress at all.</P>
      <P>For example, if the internal common areas of an apartment complex are painted with poor quality paint, there is nothing the apartment owner can do about it. If the roof is defective &mdash; a flat roof may last about 12 years, after which it must be replaced &mdash; the cause of the defect is poor workmanship, but the apartment owner cannot do anything about it. This issue can be dealt with by the Law Society and the Construction Industry Federation producing a building contract for apartment owners. Fine Gael believes this is essential.</P><Col N="1160"/>
      <P>In larger developments there can be a substantial time lag between the time the first purchaser completes a sale and the last apartment is completed. In some of the substantial developments this time lag can be between three and five years. Who provides the services in the interim and on what basis are fees calculated? Sometimes the builder will provide a service without charge, or may appoint a managing agent to provide the services. Either way the builder should be obliged to provide a set of audited accounts to each apartment owner at the end of the financial year. If these accounts are audited, this will give reassurance to an apartment owner. Auditing of accounts with regard to apartment schemes is low in terms of intellectual application and carries a nominal fee. Indeed the standard is depressingly low. The only way to correct this is to impose severe penalties on auditors who fail to provide a fully audited set of accounts.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Managing agents also cause a great deal of anxiety and we need to be much more pro-consumer in the code of practice for managing agents. There is no organisation of managing agents &mdash; anybody can become one. We have very good ones and some very bad ones. There is no accountability or control over how they handle moneys. They can maintain service charges in the same account in which their own moneys are held. That is not good enough, which is why this Bill wants all these people and companies regulated. The general standard of services provided by managing agents is substantially below that of services provided by agents in similar disciplines.</P>
      <P>There are problems relating to the kind of people in apartments. In some cases, apartments are being rented to drug dealers, for supply and for prostitution. Apartments are also being used as private restaurants. Rubbish can be left decaying for weeks outside complexes, attracting vermin. There are many problems relating to who deals with drug dealers in an apartment complex, and how one gets them out. These are serious social problems. Regrettably and unfortunately, many of our apartment complexes are fast becoming modern slums. It is an appalling fact but it is true. Unless and until they are regulated and managed properly, these problems will continue.</P>
      <P>The Bill is quite short because what we want is a regulator for apartment complexes. We would be happy if this regulator were also to regulate management companies of traditional-type housing. The Private Residential Tenancies Board already has the know-how in dealing with problems of residents, particularly in rented dwellings. The board should set out the guidelines that are necessary to ensure these regulations work for everybody. This is regulation with a light touch that leaves important decisions to those who know what they are doing. All we seek to establish are the parameters of regulation, not the detailed regulation and for this reason we see no reason for anyone to oppose it.</P><Col N="1161"/>
      <P Just="Left">The key part of the Bill is section 3, paragraph (<i>l</i>), which provides that the Private Residential Tenancies Board would be instructed to develop a code of practice for management companies and their agents. This code of practice is sadly missing. The code of practice should include the key essential element of transparent management fees. Fees should be set for the first three years of a new complex at a level that ensures managing agents can meet the established minimum standards for that period. If there is no service there should be no payment. The management fee should not be fully payable until management agents are in place and the various services can be provided. Many builders demand payment of the first year&rsquo;s management fee before the keys are handed over to the new owners. We get letters from people throughout the country who complain that when they go to buy a property the management fee is thrown in at the last minute. The sum of &euro;500 may not appear to be a huge amount on a deal of &euro;250,000 until one has to pay it every year. Not enough care and attention is devoted to their needs.</P>
      <P>An important issue is the sinking fund provision. A sinking fund is money for payments that will arise when redecorating and other large scale refurbishment have to be done. It is emerging that many managing agents set the annual fee without any provision for large scale refurbishments that must be carried out every few years. This leaves residents with a shortfall and a choice of paying several thousand euro at once or else living with a decaying physical environment. Neither scenario is tolerable. Under the terms of the Bill only those managing agents who strictly adhere to this code of practice will be allowed to trade.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill also refers to the need for proper information. The nature of this business is to make it difficult for residents to get the full picture even though in many cases the balance of power rests with them. It is vital that individual apartment owners who rely on collective action to get things done are given all the information they need. It is vital also that they have someone to turn to if confused or unsure about how to proceed. At present there is nobody whom they can consult. If our Bill is passed there certainly will be somebody whom they can consult. The key issue is the regulation of this whole area by an existing body.</P>
      <P>Given the complex legal nature of management company arrangements it is vital that consumers get the necessary protection they deserve. We have received reports that those residents seeking to change management agents have been put at a disadvantage because new agents insist that a binding contract be signed without a probation period during which the level of service can be assessed. Residents should have the right to insist on a one-year probationary period before deciding to commit to any managing agent for a longer period.</P><Col N="1162"/>
      <P>That is the core of our case. Other speakers on our side will elaborate and bring their personal experiences to bear. It is time for the Government to act. I accept and acknowledge that the Government set up a judicial committee whose report is one year over due. It is time for us to act. Our proposals are sensible and realistic. We would be happy to accept any amendment the Government or other parties may put forward. We in Fine Gael think it is time to take action on all these apartment complexes, some of which are in an appalling state. The Minister needs to intervene in the way planning permissions are granted by local authorities for traditional type housing. That is a critical issue. We need action and we need it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Olivia Mitchell. I understand the Deputy is sharing time with Deputies McEntee, Connaughton and Perry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. I am delighted to support the Bill brought forward by my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, whom I congratulate on his prescience in spotting this as a growing issue, long before it came to everybody else&rsquo;s attention. It is impossible for those of us who represent urban constituencies to avoid realising the extent of the problems caused partly by the explosion of apartment buildings but also by the management companies who proclaim to represent the owners of new apartments. As Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd said, one fifth of all building nationwide is apartments. In Dublin the rate is between 40% and 50%. In my constituency the number of houses being built is only a handful while the number of apartments represents 80% to 90% of all building in the constituency.</P>
      <P>Apartment living is becoming the norm, particularly for this generation of young home buyers. They consider themselves lucky to be able to get on the property ladder by getting an apartment. They do so without any Government attempt to regulate the management of the common areas or to provide rights or protection for people living in group developments or to control the activities of property management companies and to regulate what management companies do.</P>
      <P>There is a panoply of protections for traditional home owners but the unfortunate new generation of apartment owners have been left completely without protection. The difficulties that have arisen are a revelation to all of us. None of us anticipated the problems that would arise when virtual strangers come together and share not only a common space but a common legal obligation to each other and to the group. There is an old saying that good fences make good neighbours. Unfortunately, in the case of apartments, there are no good fences, physical or legal, to protect home owners. I say that in the full knowledge that apartment living can be extremely successful but only if we work to ensure the owners and those who live in proximity to them are pro<Col N="1163"/>tected. One thing that will destroy an area is apartment blocks falling into disrepair and that is a real danger unless we move quickly.</P>
      <P>The typical scenario for many young home owners seeking to buy an apartment is that they pay their booking deposit and many months pass before they sign the contract. It is only when they come to sign the contract that they discover there is a management company clause. Many have no idea what is a management company. At that stage it is too late to pull out. They have to sign up and often have to pay two years of management company fees without having the implications of signing up explained. When closing sales, there is an onus on solicitors to make it absolutely clear to the membership of the management company what it means, including the responsibilities and the liabilities. In many cases the responsibilities are that one pays up for a number of years to a management company long before one receives any benefits and before any of the rights become apparent. If one happens to be the first tenant into a large development one pays for several years for the prettification of the area, the fountains, wooden features and so on, which sell the apartments for the developer. Meanwhile the tenant is living on a building site and paying for his profit.</P>
      <P>The director of corporate enforcement has reported a significant increase in the number of complaints about management companies. They fail to hold annual general meetings and to report to the members on the company&rsquo;s finances and operating performance by failing to provide them with copies of the financial statements and a director&rsquo;s report and to adequately disclose to members potential conflicts of interests in circumstances where the directors also provide services to the management company. There is a huge blurring of the role of the developer in terms of developer as the management company and developer as a property management company. There is a huge conflict of interest that is indefensible and will have to be sorted out.</P>
      <P>If the directors of the management company, as opposed to the property management company, do not fulfil their duties, if they lose interest or if they stop paying, they could be struck off the company&rsquo;s register. When home owners try to sell their apartments they discover they must have an operating management company. Without a management company they cannot sell their property. That can be set up again but it involves additional legal costs.</P>
      <P>During the previous discussion of this matter, I indicated that responsibility for advising buyers of their rights and responsibilities at an early stage falls to their solicitor. I pointed out that in many cases solicitors&rsquo; fees are paid for by developers. While this may reduce costs for young couples who regard it as a bonus, there are other ways of reducing the costs of a solicitor who is dealing with many similar apartments. When I <Col N="1164"/>raised this with the Law Society it neatly avoided the issue by indicating it would be illegal for solicitors to act for both parties to a purchase, which is not the case. Solicitors act for the unfortunate buyers but their fees are paid by the seller. This practice creates a clear conflict of interest which does not serve homebuyers. In addition, it reflects badly on solicitors who should move to change it before it is changed for them.</P>
      <P>When people become disillusioned, encounter problems or their management fees increase they stop paying and the sinking fund becomes used up. The danger then is that apartments will fall into disrepair, people will become totally disillusioned with the concept of apartment living and a property problem will emerge in all urban areas.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and ask the Minister to consider doing likewise. The way in which management companies currently operate serves developers, county councils because their costs are reduced and the companies themselves which have been given a new lease of life and wonderful business opportunity. Those who are supposed to benefit &mdash; the homebuyers &mdash; are not served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2006, which I support. Ten years ago there were few, if any, apartment developments in County Meath, a position which has changed dramatically in the past five years. Major developments in Ashbourne, Bettystown and other towns in the county are a sight to behold and apartment developments now sit alongside traditional housing estates. County Meath has experienced extraordinarily rapid development with 3,886 new houses built in the county last year. Last year, the number of new housing units in the county was the fourth highest in the country after Dublin where 18,000 new houses were built.</P>
      <P>The population of County Meath is projected to reach 180,000 or more by 2012. Every week, new families move into the county and other commuter counties around Dublin, with many moving into large apartment developments. These new communities face many challenges. Residents generally work a long distance from their new homes, child care and commuting are a nightmare and every day is a balancing act. It is unfair that, having committed themselves to large mortgage repayments, couples face the prospect of faceless management companies extracting from them sums that would have paid for a mortgage in the past for the privilege of managing the estate on which they live. These families, which are generally young, are caught in a pincer movement with little or no wriggle room if their family or employment circumstances change.</P>
      <P>Apartment owners and dwellers are already feeling vulnerable. Those moving into large apartment developments reflect the new Ireland in that many of them are from new European Union member states in eastern Europe or other <Col N="1165"/>countries. They deserve proper protection from the State and the full protection of the law, as the Bill proposes to introduce. The code of practice proposed in the legislation is the appropriate way to proceed as it gives management companies and their agents an opportunity to get their houses in order. The Bill also proposes to widen the remit of the Private Residential Tenancies Board to include the regulation of apartment complex management companies and their agents and, in a further welcome development, the board would be given power to mediate in disputes.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>In the past, the taking in charge of estates by county councils was a hot political potato. This approach has been partially replaced with proper management of apartment developments across the country. For this reason, this Bill sponsored by the Fine Gael Party is overdue and should be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome this Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd. Contrary to the belief that apartment management companies are based only in Dublin, these companies are being established throughout the country. Even in east Galway, from where I come, there is no shortage of such companies. The Bill affords Deputies an opportunity to ascertain what estate management companies do, how they do it and for what reason they were set up in the first instance. Who benefits from the management of apartment complexes by private companies? Is it the builder, local authority or homeowner because it is certainly not the new owner of the property?</P>
      <P>While the fees I will cite are low in comparison with those mentioned by my colleagues from Dublin, they are a problem. Recently, a young couple from a small town in County Galway approached me having received an annual bill for management fees of &euro;500. They were unaware that these fees were payable. Two days after receiving that bill they received another one for &euro;360 from the county council for waste management fees. Together, these bills amount to almost &euro;1,000. With two children in a cr&egrave;che and having borrowed heavily, the couple cannot afford to pay &euro;1,000. Is this financially good for them either now or in the future?</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, builders were traditionally required to bring estates to a certain standard before the local council would assume responsibility for them. I have seen this approach in action time and again over the years, albeit not so often in recent years. The residents of such estates then dealt with the council. Ten or 15 years ago, before greed came into play, another concept emerged based on the meitheal tradition with which some of us were brought up. This was the formation of residents&rsquo; associations and loose co-operatives of well-meaning people for the purpose of keeping their estates in good order. The schemes involved levying voluntary contributions <Col N="1166"/>on each house in an estate. Suddenly, however, new legal entities have been established to make a business from this sector.</P>
      <P>Young people are so delighted that their hour has come and they will take ownership of a new house that they do not read the small print of the contract they sign. Worse still, the professionals with whom they deal do not tell them about the small print. If the Bill does nothing else, it will at least alert young people to the importance of finding out to what precisely they are agreeing. Management fees will be akin to a ball and chain hung around their necks, although some residents may well be delighted to participate in estate management schemes.</P>
      <P>Who is involved in management companies? Are the developers or solicitors involved? Where is the transparency in this regard? How can residents of estates find out exactly how their money is being spent? This lack of transparency is causing considerable agitation among many young people. They accept they agreed to pay estate management fees but they were not aware they were doing so when they signed the contract. They now find themselves unable to pay the fees. If, in the next year or two, interest rates increase, as we are told to expect, this will become a major problem.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This Bill is important as it will introduce transparency. Let the signal go out to every young couple signing on the dotted line that the rules relating to management companies are legally binding.  They have become all-powerful. It appears to be difficult to disengage from them. Against that background, the more the communities in these new estates know about this, the better they will be able to handle it on the day they should know, namely the day they sign their contracts.</P>
      <P>Everybody speaks about trying to protect young people against the ever increasing cost of housing. The Government tried over the past nine or ten years but was unsuccessful. A house that cost &euro;300,000 last year will cost &euro;330,000 this year and will probably cost &euro;360,000 next year. That is what is happening. The management fee is a crippling levy. Whoever should bear the cost, it certainly should not be the new homeowner. For that reason, I support this Bill. It is a sensible measure and I ask the Minister to accept it on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important Bill. A great deal of money is given to people who buy houses either through 100% finance or through the section 23 provision. It is difficult to raise a family in a dwelling of 600 sq. ft. In fact, very few of these apartments are designed and built for families. They are totally inadequate. There are no facilities for children to park their bicycles and no amenities in any sense.</P><Col N="1167"/>
      <P>While management companies are welcome, they fail in their obligation to look after children. There is heavy occupancy of apartments at present but it will be hard for young couples to rear children there. There is an obligation on management companies to provide services that facilitate families. The developments in Dublin are not geared towards families but towards people who can get 100% finance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton is correct that when people sign for the mortgage, the insurance policy and the stacked up costs, they are so delighted to get the money they feel they are getting it for nothing. Interest rates are low at present. However, although the interest rate has reduced, it has been replaced by the principle, in that an apartment that was previously &euro;200,000 is now priced at &euro;250,000. The auctioneering company could probably change that too. Auctioneers are part of the cycle. There is no control on auctioneers or how one buys an apartment. Management companies can charge &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,500 a year and the person has no option but to sign up for this. All they might do is shampoo the carpets. They seem to do nothing else.</P>
      <P>Section 23 was proposed to encourage development and, in the context of the seaside resort scheme, the section was extremely relevant in Sligo. Developers built houses and it was a cash rich enterprise. The State also got a ball of money. Development is a cash cow. A total of 80,000 homes are being built per year so billions of euro are coming to the State from the development sector. The economy is being driven by the housing sector. It is regrettable that a sector that is so beneficial to the economy is so unregulated in every sense.</P>
      <P>Vulnerable people are locked into a mortgage agreement that must be paid. They point to an interest rate of 3% or 4% but the principle must also be repaid. They are also locked into an insurance premium to guarantee the mortgage and into a management contract to maintain the open spaces in the development. Consider what the developers get from this. It is a safeguard. If there are snags such as cracks in the walls, the management company does the work that initially should have been done by the contractor who built the apartment. In effect, the management contract is paying for the maintenance of the hallways, alleyways and open areas. That is regrettable.</P>
      <P>The tax taken from this sector is unbelievable, particularly when one considers the scale of development. The apartments look fantastic in the short term but wait for five years. Every business needs a complete refit and redesign after seven years. Look at these apartments in seven years when section 23 runs out. What will happen? The developer will be gone, lost in a series of companies that will be untraceable. Nobody <Col N="1168"/>will take responsibility. Will the State or the local authority take responsibility? I doubt it.</P>
      <P>Somebody must pay. The State must get involved. There must be protection for tenancy agreements. People are renting apartments from landlords who might have a total of 20 apartments. The landlord is in it for speculative reasons. He is getting the tax write-off. In effect, the State is financing these apartments, even though the regeneration has been very welcome. The Minister, however, has a responsibility to ensure there is a contract so people can know exactly what they are getting involved in. The management companies must be regulated and work by a constitution. There should be uniformity of discipline throughout the State.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the draft plan for the Cranmore regeneration project in Sligo. This estate consists of 511 houses. The houses were built in five phases between the early 1970s and 1985. Approximately 50% of these homes remain in public ownership and the area has a population of 2,500. Two thirds of the residents of Cranmore are aged under 35 years and unemployment in the area can be as high as 70%. The regeneration project is due to cost &euro;26 million.</P>
      <P>This is one of the big estates that were poorly built in the 1970s and 1980s and nothing has been done with them since then. Among the proposals contained in the draft plan is the development of quality housing in the area. This includes the refurbishment and redevelopment of some existing houses as well as the demolition and replacement of others. The Cranmore regeneration project intends to provide quality recreational space and a new centre block with a multi-purpose hall. This is most important.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is important to provide children&rsquo;s amenities, playgrounds and multi-purpose halls. Otherwise, there will be a massive problem with the young population who will be completely disillusioned. The State is failing in its responsibility to provide this service. It is imperative the concerns of Cranmore residents in Sligo are taken on board as the regeneration plan for the estate gets under way. The Minister has been discussing this with the borough council. I urge the Department to progress this project as quickly as possible. The plan is on the Minister&rsquo;s desk and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing has viewed the area. Support is necessary.</P>
      <P>When discussing the regeneration of regions and the housing stock of the country &mdash; 80,000 homes have been built in the past year &mdash; there is a massive responsibility to get high density housing right. There is now a ratio of 16 houses to the acre. It is critical that a concrete jungle is not being built without amenities for children. They are the next generation. There are single parents and demographic difficulties in every region, town and village. We welcome the boom in the economy and how noticeable it has been in <Col N="1169"/>the housing sector but the crisis facing the economy is the huge level of dissatisfaction with, and the lack of responsibility of, contractors who fail in their obligation to include amenities.</P>
      <P>These developers are multimillionaires. This is not speculative development but speculation by developers. Given the amount of high density apartment blocks being built, it has been a major mistake not to have a legal framework in place that would obligate developers to fulfil their social obligations. There is great social anxiety at present and the Celtic tiger has generated that to a huge extent. It even extends to coastal communities which have been equally propelled by tax breaks. I urge the Minister to do the decent thing and seriously consider accepting this Bill. If he does, he will deal with a significant issue that faces huge numbers of the population in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">To delete &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to add at the end of the motion &ldquo;this day nine months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Connor.  I hope to do the decent thing and I am taking the unusual step of proposing an amendment to postpone the acceptance of Second Stage of the Bill for a nine-month period. I had hoped to move this as a reasoned amendment outlining in the amendment the basis for doing so, but I understand that is not possible.</P>
      <P>I agree with the general sentiment that this is an area that requires change and specific attention. However, with the best will in the world, it does not achieve this and I will try to explain why and the reason I seek to postpone Second Stage. First, the Law Reform Commission is examining the issue of the regulation of these companies and is expected to report in the near future, which I will encourage. Second, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is developing proposals for a national property services regulatory agency and, third, I consider that legislation will most appropriately be developed in the light of this ongoing work. There are issues which need to be addressed with regard to management companies in Ireland but I am not convinced that the Bill in its current form will address those issues. I do not say this with the intention of putting down the author of the Bill. I accept the sentiment, but the Bill has some fundamental flaws which I will outline.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Apartment living has multiplied in Ireland in the past 15 years or so. As the Fine Gael Bill accepts, there is a need for management companies in modern apartment complexes. There is also a need to ensure that people&rsquo;s hard earned investment in their home is protected by ensuring that <Col N="1170"/>the structure and external fabric of the building is maintained.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the law in this regard in Ireland has not kept pace with the increase in high density living we now see. Countries with long-standing apartment living have a more sophisticated approach than we have. That is why the Government has asked the Law Reform Commission to examine this issue. It is also the reason the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is developing proposals for a national property services regulatory authority. The Government does not oppose the thinking behind this Bill. We are happy to work constructively with all interested parties to review current arrangements, but there are some fundamental problems.</P>
      <P>I understand the Bill was only printed over the weekend and the House has not had the opportunity to review all its provisions. However, from an initial view there are problems in its approach in some regards. If we passed it, I do not think Fine Gael would get any marks for regulatory impact analysis. To rush this Bill and get an unsatisfactory result would be a disservice to apartment dwellers and would be counter-productive to what we intend to do in the area. It is for those reasons that I propose to postpone the Bill.</P>
      <P>There are a number of serious questions about the approach proposed in this Bill, including the level of bureaucratic involvement it implies, which I will outline in more detail. The proposal that the private residential tenancies board, PRTB, should be involved in regulating the relationship between property owners and managing agents would not be appropriate and would seriously detract from the PRTB&rsquo;s role with regard to landlord and tenant matters in the private rented accommodation. We must remember the reason the PRTB was established was to operate the new landlord and tenant system in the private rented sector. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to give the board this additional role.</P>
      <P>The whole area of property management is complex, involving a number of different dimensions and issues, including the role of developers, managing agents and their relationships; the role and responsibilities of management companies; the role of the new property services regulatory agency; practical issues such as the standard of maintenance, level of and increases in management charges; the application of conveyancing law and practice in this area; issues relating to the operation of owner-controlled management companies and requirements of company law in that context; and linkage, in some cases, between planning conditions and provisions relating to management companies in purchase contracts. I am less than happy with the way some local authorities have operated in this area.</P><Col N="1171"/>
      <P>The Bill before us, as drafted, is not capable of capturing all these different, complex and interrelated elements. We would do people a disservice by not incorporating these diverse issues in legislation we produce. In its current format the Bill would not deal with a number of key issues that give rise to problems. I will return to this issue.</P>
      <P>The Government will address the problems on a number of fronts, particularly in the context of the upcoming report from the Law Reform Commission. My Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will jointly prepare a report for the Government on the work done to date on this issue.</P>
      <P>The legal issues involved are generally outside my area of responsibility. However, I am concerned, both from the perspective of my Department&rsquo;s housing role and the need for householders to get a fair deal, to promote practical action to tackle the problems we have come across. The solutions to problems in this area do not depend entirely on statutory action. Many, indeed most, of the difficulties that have come to light are attributable to what might charitably be termed shoddy practice on the part of certain interested parties. Deputy Connaughton spoke wisely on this and pointed out that some of the information on conveyancing given to clients leaves much to be desired.</P>
      <P>Property owners in multi-unit structures must be put in a position which will allow them to ensure that their management companies operate effectively and in the common interest. There are many instances where unit owners have been prevented from taking effective control of the management entity. There also tends to be an information deficit in this area, which is inimical to the effective operation of management arrangements, particularly through the control of those arrangements by the owners. We will address these deficiencies through legislation where necessary and in the meantime through practical measures.</P>
      <P>The legal profession also has a key role in protecting home buyers from abuses. Conveyancers need to be vigilant in ensuring that the rights of buyers are fully safeguarded from inappropriate obligations or excessive costs in house purchase contracts, particularly where buyers feel pressurised in the context of a rising property market. I hope that the legal profession as a whole will be able to help raise the level of protection further and I will expand on this later.</P>
      <P>Local authorities must also play their part. In particular they must avoid adding to complexities or uncertainty in the context of applying planning conditions relating to management arrangements. My Department is pursuing this aspect with local authorities. Local authorities have taken a diverse <Col N="1172"/>range of actions and we will make it clearer to them what we expect in this regard.</P>
      <P>A basic source of difficulty in the area is the general lack of information and understanding about the need for and role of management companies and the rights and obligations of home owners. As an immediate practical step to address this information deficit, I have asked my Department to co-ordinate the provision of clear and concise general information, particularly for home buyers. In the past ten years alone over 100,000 apartments have been built.</P>
      <P>Apartment complexes have special management and maintenance needs because of the extent of shared or communal elements involved. Interdependence is an inherent feature of apartment living. This necessitates a range of rights and responsibilities with a mechanism for upholding, enforcing and where necessary, reconciling these, in the interest of all the owners and residents. The fact that most apartment buildings accommodate different tenures, and in some cases a mix of residential and commercial use, adds a further level of complexity.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Arrangements for managing and maintaining the communal elements of private apartment complexes are generally addressed through management companies. The appropriate practice is that shortly after the sale of all units in an apartment complex is complete, control of the management company is transferred from the developer to the owners of the individual units. The legal requirements relating to membership of these companies and associated obligations are brought to bear through the conveyancing process.</P>
      <P>A cause of confusion in this area is misunderstanding of the role of &ldquo;management companies&rdquo; and &ldquo;managing agents&rdquo;, because we tend to use the two terms interchangeably. It may be more meaningful to regard management companies as &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; companies or vehicles. On the other hand, property managing agents or management service providers are commercial entities engaged by management companies to carry out day-to-day operations. These agents appear to be a key source of problems and complaints from apartment owners, particularly regarding levels of fees, quality of service and accountability.</P>
      <P>Problems have arisen from a range of factors, including failings on the part of developers or managing agents, poor administration of management companies, often due to inadequate participation by apartment owners, refusal of some owners to pay charges and the fact that some requirements under company law do not appear to be well suited to the circumstances of apartment management companies. These are complex issues which must be dealt with systematically.</P>
      <P>The proposed new national property services regulatory authority is intended to regulate these operations. It will have the function of licensing, regulating and dealing with complaints about <Col N="1173"/>property management service providers or agents. The group which recommended the establishment of the regulatory authority also recommended that agents be subject to oversight by the authority, to vetting and complaints procedures and that managing agents should contribute to a fidelity fund to be operated by the authority. This addresses some of the core issues raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and will be a most important development because it is clear the operation of managing agents is a major element of many of the problems that arise with regard to property management.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Another major source of potential difficulties arises at the stage when the buyer of a house or apartment signs the contract to purchase. It is at this point that the obligation to become a member of the management company and make relevant financial contributions tends to arise. A key issue in this context is control of the management company. A fundamental source of current problems is the fact that house buyers can be obliged to sign contracts under which they have obligations, including hefty charges, with regard to management companies, but have no guarantee that they will be able to influence the operation of these companies because developers can use artifices to retain effective control of management companies. They do this, of course, because there is a profit for them in so doing. This seems to derive from the fact that standard conveyancing practice and documentation allows a way for developers, if they so wish, to retain control of these companies indefinitely by keeping ownership of at least one unit in the development. A specific time limit must be set for the transfer of control of the management company from developers to the owners of units. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd pointed out that the basic conveyancing instrument was established long before communal living became common.</P>
      <P>A number of other issues arise with regard to conditions in house purchase contracts relating to management arrangements. The level of management charges is a particular focus of complaint. Provisions relating to management arrangements must provide for the reasonableness and adequacy of charges.</P>
      <P>The allocation of responsibilities and associated costs between developers and management companies and their members seems to be a source of particular difficulty. This issue is not, nor could it be, properly dealt with in this Bill. The effectiveness or otherwise of the operation of the management company after control passes to the owners of units is another important issue which must be dealt with in comprehensive legislation.</P>
      <P>It is precisely because there is a complex interplay of different legislative codes and differing practical and legal issues in this area that the Government requested the Law Reform Com<Col N="1174"/>mission to convene an expert group to examine all of the issues that arise in the case of multi-unit structures. The commission&rsquo;s consultation paper is likely to be published by the summer. I expect this report will address the various issues to which I have referred. Another very important matter that will be addressed in the report is mechanisms to deal with situations where problems have already occurred, whether through defects or inadequacies in conveyancing documentation or problems with the constitution or operation of management companies. Obviously if we are to have an even playing field, we must address the deficiencies which already exist, in addition to putting controls in place for the future.</P>
      <P>The Government will consider the recommendations in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s final report, including the need for any new legislation in this area. Without pre-empting the commission&rsquo;s recommendations, it seems likely some provisions in conveyancing law will probably be needed to deal with some of the problems that have come to light with regard to property management arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of problems being experienced by apartment owners and am determined to do everything in my power to resolve them. However, the solution to all of these problems will not be achieved by way of a very short Bill, however well intentioned it may be. If we were to take this particular step, as outlined in the Bill, we would not be doing anybody a service. That is why I am suggesting the delay of nine months.</P>
      <P>It takes time to have new legislation drawn up and enacted, particularly in complex areas like this. Even though legislative action is not likely to arise primarily in my area of responsibility, I am determined to ensure any practical action that might help improve matters in the short term will be actively pursued.</P>
      <P>Something of a side issue to the question of management arrangements has emerged in terms of a small number of local authorities imposing planning conditions requiring the establishment of management companies. This matter has been raised in parliamentary questions by Deputy Catherine Murphy and others and is one which also concerns me. Concern has been raised that some conditions have been drafted in a way, or applied in circumstances, that may permit uncertainty, at the very least, about the responsibility of developers to complete residential developments and to maintain and repair infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Provisions of the planning laws should not be used to transfer responsibility for public infrastructure, such as roads, footpaths, sewers, water mains and public lighting in housing estates to the residents, although I have a suspicion that some local authority officials may have that at the back of their minds. Last January the Department issued a circular letter to planning authorities <Col N="1175"/>reminding them of their responsibilities under the Planning and Development Act 2000. It also reiterated that the existence of a management company to maintain elements of common buildings should not be used to frustrate the taking in charge of estates. The majority of planning authorities do not attach conditions to planning permissions requiring management companies to be set up, although a number do and I will be encouraging local authorities to discontinue this inappropriate practice.</P>
      <P>While the legal framework is an important element, insufficient awareness on the part of owners as to how apartment complex management arrangements work and a lack of appreciation of their own responsibilities and powers has contributed to problems. The maintenance and management of private apartment complexes is ultimately the responsibility of the apartment owners, just as any house owner has to take responsibility for his or her home. In the apartment complex context, this is catered for in a communal way through management companies but it must be stressed that ultimately control of these companies must rest with the apartment owners and not a third party which is using them as a source of revenue. If there are problems with the way a company is operating, it is primarily the responsibility of the owners, who are the company, to have these addressed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Legislative measures to ensure timely transfer of control of management companies to owners and to enable these to operate effectively will be considered in light of the Law Reform Commission report. I expect the report will also address the need for consumer protection provisions such as requirements on developers to provide information and guidance to prospective buyers. I encourage buyers of apartments to ensure their solicitors examine carefully any clauses in contracts dealing with management arrangements and obligations. There is a particular onus on conveyancers to help protect buyers from any exploitation in this context. It would be desirable, in advance of any legislation, if a rigorous approach could be taken across the profession against inappropriate, even if not strictly illegal, contractual clauses relating to management companies to help squeeze out bad practices.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Under the Government&rsquo;s proposals, regulation of managing agents will be the responsibility of the new national property services regulatory authority. Legislation is being drafted to provide for the establishment of the authority and to detail its regulatory regime. I do not know what this will contain ultimately, but I expect it will provide for a much better level of control than that proposed in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill.</P>
      <P>I unreservedly agree with the need to make adequate provision for a sinking fund so sufficient <Col N="1176"/>funds are available to carry out major renovation. However, as I have stressed, it would be unwise to proceed with legislation without the benefit of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recommendations as such issues require specific attention under law. I am suggesting the agreement of standard clauses in relation to sinking funds and other clearly identified matters for inclusion in all conveyancing documentation.</P>
      <P>The Private Members&rsquo; Bill seems to suggest that managing agents should be responsible for the provision of information on the rights and responsibilities of residents and on how management companies work, to the management company members. As managing agents are employed by management companies, is it appropriate to give them the role of educating their employers?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Bill is predicated on the assumption that property management agencies are an inevitable feature of all apartment buildings. This is not the case as smaller complexes tend not to employ managing agents. Management companies of some larger complexes, whose owner-members are active, may decide to contract the required services directly and not utilise an agency. Is it wise for the legislation to be specific on these functions?</P>
      <P>How would the Bill justify making the Private Residential Tenancies Board, whose mandate relates to private rented accommodation, responsible for the regulation of managing agents and their relationships with owners of apartments and the management companies of which they are members? How would such a proposal fit with the auctioneering review group recommendation, with which the Government agrees, that the proposed national property services regulatory authority should have responsibility for regulation of managing agents? How would it ensure such a major change would not undermine the role of the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the important functions it is performing in the private rented sector? How would the board be in a position to address property management issues on behalf of apartment owners related to aspects of conveyancing and company law?</P>
      <P>The proposed functions are not appropriate to the board and would divert it from its core task of implementing and taking forward much-needed reforms in the private rental sector. It is essential that the board is allowed to continue its key role, which is still in the course of development, of providing a means for upholding the rights of tenants and supporting a professional approach by landlords. To divert the board from these functions would take from this important work. It would be unfortunate given that little attention was paid in the past to the sector, which is what the Residential Tenancies Act sought to redress.</P>
      <P>The promoters of the Bill can ponder on these questions. I will be interested to hear views on <Col N="1177"/>these matters in the course of the debate and on how the entire range of issues relating to management of multi-unit structures can be effectively and comprehensively addressed.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to oppose the Bill as I have sympathy with its main objectives. However, the Bill as presented is deficient. That is why I am suggesting this approach. Members will know that my approach is based on good will towards the Bill and on an anxiety to resolve the problem.</P>

	<P>I had a good day with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. This morning he announced he was allocating &euro;15,000 to Tallaght under South Dublin County Council&rsquo;s disability strategy.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I agree there are challenges with the management of apartment complexes. The approach he is taking is a reasonable one. In the D&aacute;il and other fora I have raised issues about the operation of estate management companies. The work of the Private Residential Tenancies Board is of particular interest to all Members. Recently, I have been at several meetings where the question of the functions of the board has been raised. I have concerns with its ability to tackle problems in rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>Although I am not suggesting that the Dublin South-West constituency is different from any other, it is accepted that there have been particular challenges in the Tallaght area. The Springfield parish in which I live, which includes Virginia Heights, has had several challenges with rented accommodation. The Private Residential Tenancies Board must be given the resources and mechanisms to deal with these issues.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on his efforts in producing the Bill. On several occasions, I have raised issues relating to estate management companies. When Deputy Gilmore last raised the issue, I stated I had been to several public meetings in Tallaght, particularly in the Marfield Estate. I always speak positively about Tallaght. It is a different place from the one I moved to many years ago. Since the town Square opened 15 years ago, Tallaght has come of age in its development.</P>

	<P>It is an ever-changing environment and in five years it will be an entirely different place. The Square is known by some as crane place. It is a hive of activity with much building work going on. I am concerned with the number of apartment blocks being developed. I know housing is an important issue, but different challenges are coming to the surface with apartment block developments and we must be careful that what we are allowing to be developed will be good for our towns.</P>
      <P>There are concerns about the operation of apartment block management companies. I do not know if the position is the same in Marino and Clontarf but gaining access to many apartment blocks is not easy. I spend much time trying to reach constituents in apartment blocks. There is also the wider issue of the registration of voters in apartment blocks. It is not just political activists who have this problem but also postal workers. Given that our dwelling habits are changing, the Department must consider the difficulties that arise.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister accepts there are problems with the operation of management companies. I gave the example of the Marfield Estate. That was a case of people believing they were not treated in the best way when the estate was handed over. I am glad that local authorities will not be allowed to abdicate their responsibilities in this regard. I have often spoken about the need to remind local authorities that the taking in charge of estates and accommodation units is an important process. People depend upon us to make that point. There are estates in my constituency where taking-in-charge procedures were not initiated for many years, which causes many problems. There is one estate in Tallaght where people are still waiting for the grass to be cut regularly. Some 15 years after the estate was built the builder still has not finished the estate. I wish the Minister well in tackling these problems. He has my support, as ever. I compliment my colleagues on the Opposition benches for their initiative.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this Private Members&rsquo; Bill which has been tabled on behalf of Fine Gael by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd to amend the Residential Tenancies Act. I welcome the Bill as a further opportunity to debate the need to end the practice whereby <Col N="1179"/>management companies are being used to perform work that should be done by local authorities in normal housing estates. It is also an opportunity to call for the abolition of management charges in housing estates, as distinct from apartment buildings.</P>
      <P>The management charges levied on housing estates and apartment blocks are, in effect, the modern form of domestic rates. However, these rates are paid not to local authorities but to private management companies. They are paid, in the main, by first-time home buyers in new housing estates and new apartment developments for the same public services which used to be provided by local authorities &mdash; public lighting, management of open spaces, provision and maintenance of roads and, in some cases, the provision and maintenance of water and sewage services.</P>
      <P>They are an additional burden on families already overstretched with mortgage repayments and child care costs. Such charges can range from &euro;500 to over &euro;1,000 per annum. The amount is not controlled or regulated and it can be charged indefinitely.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party previously addressed this issue in a Private Members&rsquo; motion that was debated in the House on 22 and 23 November 2005. That motion sought to solve the growing problem of management charges and management companies in private housing development. That motion called on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to take three forms of action to address the management company problem, namely, to stop new management companies being formed and new management charges being levied, to regulate management companies and charges where they currently exist and to legislate to wind up management companies, end management charges and have the housing development taken in charge and maintained by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Sadly, on that occasion the Government saw fit to table its own amended motion. That motion promised action on the issue of management charges but nothing has happened. In this evening&rsquo;s debate, the best the Minister can do is to plead for another nine months of further inactivity.</P>
      <P>During the debate last November, the Minister told us the Law Reform Commission was engaging with this issue. We have received the same answer this evening. The only advance is that the Minister now tells us the Law Reform Commission is likely to publish a consultation paper &mdash; not even a report &mdash; this summer. We are a long way from the point at which the Law Reform Commission will produce a report and even further from the point where the Government will take action on it.</P>
      <P>The Minister also told us last November that he had asked the Department to obtain a report from planning authorities on their policies for attaching conditions concerning management <Col N="1180"/>companies to planning conditions for residential development. We have heard nothing about this report since then. We have heard from the Minister this evening that a letter went from his Department informing local authorities of their responsibilities to take estates in charge but we do not appear to have had any information from the Minister. At least, he has not taken the opportunity to put on record the practice throughout local authorities with regard to the establishment of management companies.</P>
      <P>Last November, the Minister also told us that local authorities could use section 180 of the Planning and Development Act, which allows residents in a housing estate to petition the local authority to have the estate taken in charge. He assured the House that was perfectly feasible and legal, and that it would resolve the problem. Within weeks of the Minister having told the House that was the case, Fingal County Council produced a report, on foot of a resolution proposed by my Labour Party colleagues on that council, which stated the provisions of section 180 do not apply to estates where a management company exists, as the land in question is in the ownership and control of such a company. The report went on to refer to the difficulties the local authority had in dealing with vesting orders as defined under the Planning Act 2000. Therefore, the measure the Minister claimed could be used by residents to provide relief was not workable.</P>
      <P>In the same November debate, the Minister hinted that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, if the Deputy wishes to send me that information in writing I will provide him with a full legal response to it, point by point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I sent the information to the Minister on 11 January 2006. I wrote to him on that date about this point. In the course of his reply in November he told us the following week he would launch a draft of modern guidelines for planning authorities on development management. I interpreted that to mean there would be some response in those draft management guidelines to address the issue of management companies. There was no mention of the management companies, however, in the draft guidelines which were published by the Minister within a couple of weeks of the debate last November. That matter was the subject of a letter I sent to the Minister on 11 January 2006, in which I addressed both the absence of action on the draft management guidelines to deal with management companies and the issues raised in the manager&rsquo;s report from Fingal County Council.</P>
      <P>This issue has been raised by a number of Deputies, including myself. It was the subject of a Labour Party motion last November and is now the subject of a Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; Bill, yet the Minister is seeking extra time. This is not an area where additional time can be played for <Col N="1181"/>because people are being fleeced and financially crippled by management charges. There are housing estates where management companies have been inappropriately established as a means of dealing with the maintenance, running and upkeep of the estates.</P>
      <P>People currently buying houses and apartments are being subjected to a requirement to join a management company and pay management charges in a completely unregulated environment. It is bad enough that young working families who are trying to start out in life must pay a huge price for their homes and furnishings, in addition to legal and other professional fees. They are then caught, however, for an annual charge for something that, certainly in the case of housing developments, should be the remit of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I accept the idea of management companies ordering and maintaining residential developments was previously confined to private apartment developments and some small, expensive housing developments. Until recently, normal housing estates did not have management companies or charges. These housing estates were usually designed, constructed and completed to a standard which the local authority required for taking in charge. As we know, some developers failed in their obligation to complete housing estates satisfactorily, a subject that has already been addressed by a Labour Party Bill which passed Second Stage in this House in spring 2005.</P>
      <P>In the case of apartment developments, matters were a bit more complicated, so a solution was found whereby developers would establish a management company, generally comprised of the owners of the apartments. This management company would have responsibility for the care, maintenance and management of the common areas. The apartment owners would pay an annual charge to the management company for these services. This practice was largely confined to apartment developments and, except for a few exceptional circumstances, it did not apply in normal housing developments. The picture has changed since. We now have the problem of management companies being used in standard housing developments and the problems which arise in mixed types of developments containing houses and apartments where the distinctions are blurred. The use of a management company which would have been appropriate within the immediate curtilage of the apartment buildings is extended to include the car parking area, roads and the general open space.</P>
      <P>Other problems which arise, especially in apartment developments, are those associated with multiple ownership. In some cases the developers of apartments retain ownership of quite a number of units. The old situation was that a block of apartments was sold to individuals who either lived in them or used them as investment properties and let them. Generally one had one apartment per one owner. We now have <Col N="1182"/>situations where people buy multiple units in apartment blocks or where the original developer or a company associated with him or her retains ownership of some or large numbers of the apartments, in effect controlling the management companies established.</P>
      <P>Many devices are used to do this. One is where the original developer initially has control of the management company and will not cede that control until the last unit is sold. All the developer has to do is retain ownership of the last unit and effectively he or she retains control of the management company. It is a jungle out there for people trying to buy homes. They are trying to make ends meet and are being fleeced, not only for the price of the unit of accommodation in the first place but also for continuing charges.</P>
      <P>It is scandalous that we return to this issue month after month and session after session and the Government has not budged. Asking the House to wait another nine months to deal with an urgent problem long past the stage when it should have been dealt with is unacceptable. I take this opportunity to again call for the introduction of measures proposed by the Labour Party last November to ban the use of management companies in normal housing estates. They should be taken in charge by local authorities. Where management companies must apply they should be regulated and the Fine Gael Bill provides a framework for such regulation. Some relief must be provided for people already stretched by payment of their mortgages from having to pay a charge for what should be a public service in the first place and for which, in any event, they pay taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I read with interest the Minister&rsquo;s speech in response to this valuable legislation produced by our Fine Gael colleagues. The Minister often appears inside and outside this House as somebody who trained his entire life to be a Minister in the Cabinet. It is obviously a job he would like to continue doing after this time next year. It is regrettable that he told us that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is developing a proposal for a national property services regulatory authority. The Minister has had a long innings in which to address this issue.</P>
      <P>The current situation developed during the massive construction boom we had during the past nine years, culminating in 250,000 apartment and other housing units during the past three years. The entire system of planning, construction and selling homes is riddled with sharp practice from start to finish. Examples of this are the rezoning scandals we discussed in the House last week, the failure to involve in the planning system ordinary people living in areas and districts changed beyond belief by massive high-density plans, such as in the north side of Dublin, and the auctioneering profession. The Building Control Bill is a valuable initiative but it comes too <Col N="1183"/>late for a large tranche of development in the greater Dublin area and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The man sitting behind the Minister, who identifies a great deal with Tallaght, made points on how houses are sold and how young people are treated throughout the process. Finally, they get their keys and find out the incredible situation regarding management companies. It is riddled with sharp practice and the Government had the opportunity to address it during the past nine years and nothing has been forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The modest Bill before us might address these issues. I welcome the establishment of the private residential tenancies board and the information it has given us about the residential and rented markets. It is the first sign of a regulator in this territory in our history and the first sign of any attempt to give tenants and young householders a fair crack of the whip. It might be easier to extend the powers of an existing regulator as described in the Fine Gael Bill.</P>
      <P>The type of sharp practice taking place in many major new developments is astonishing and appalling. As my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, stated builders and developers hold a tranche of apartments or houses for themselves. Young people in one of the famous early morning queues find out an entire block of houses or apartments has been held for the developer and his or her colleagues who will then establish a management company and acquire additional revenue after the massive profits they will make from the sale of most of the development and additional rents.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether colleagues mentioned the particularly poignant email many of us received from a Dublin West constituent in recent weeks. He outlined the outrageous impact of the management company. He did not know anything about it when he reached his estate. He states his concerns are numerous, the main ones being the way in which he found out about the existence of the management company; the unbelievable pressure which existed at the point of signing the contract, even through his solicitor; the lack of information and time to assess it; the natural injustice of backdating increases of management charges on those who paid two years upfront, amounting to &euro;400 or &euro;500 per annum, and receiving early bills for the third and fourth years; the exponential rate at which the fees increased and failure to deliver key services.</P>
      <P>That last point is the most blatant. This involves an estate of houses where there was an absolute failure to deliver key services on cleaning, street lighting and other basic services which we all assumed would be delivered by local authorities. Other concerns listed in the email were the extent of the liability company, which includes public liability and the extent to which householders themselves are liable in that regard; and confusion about house insurance and the <Col N="1184"/>basic injustice that those who benefit from this mechanism are the instigators of the system.</P>
      <P>The author of the e-mail indicts Fingal County Council most of all for allowing this system through the planning process. There is also the injustice of older households having a full range of services from city and county councils while new householders do not receive any service. He details the great anguish he has suffered for the past three or four years living on this estate in Dublin West, and the way he and his family have been &ldquo;gouged&rdquo; for these charges by the management company. He knew nothing about this company when he went to view the estate and bought the house. It is sharp practice, as I said recently to the head of one of the leading auctioneering firms. It is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility to take some action and he could start by adopting this Bill.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the need for the Minister for Health and Children to appoint a neurologist with support staff to the mid-western regional hospital. This is a matter of urgency because the visiting neurologist no longer accepts new patients. I also welcome the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is in the House tonight because he will share my concern about this matter. We both served on the former Mid-Western Health Board when this issue was raised many times over the years.</P>
        <P>This issue is vital to thousands of people in the mid-west region who suffer from neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and many other conditions. The situation is woefully inadequate and very distressing for patients. General practitioners have been instructed to refer new patients to Dublin, Cork or Galway. A circular is sent around when GPs attempt to refer patients to the limited service that exists in the mid west. It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The following is the current position regarding the neurology services at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Dooradoyle, Limerick. At present the Mid-Western Regional Hospital has the services of a visiting consultant neurologist for two days per month. This consultant provides an outpatient service for review return patients and an inpatient consultation service only. The waiting list for neurological assessment has grown substantially and waiting times for routine appointments of several years are not uncommon. Due to pressure on the existing service, I regret to inform you that the <Col N="1185"/>hospital cannot accept further new patient referrals. The neurologist will continue to see review patients and draw patients from the review waiting list as it stands, but I would advise that new patient referrals should be forwarded to the GPs&rsquo; neurological services at Cork, Galway and Dublin.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Please note that any patient seen within the last two years will be seen as a return patient. However, if the interval is greater than two years the patient will be regarded as a new referral. It is with great regret that this action continues to be taken but the current volume of work is not sustainable within the existing consultant staffing levels.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That circular has been in place for at least two years but the hospital continues to send it out whenever a GP tries to refer a patient to the services.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and I were members of the then Mid-Western Health Board when it made recommendations on this matter in 1999 and 2003. The Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report on neurology and neurophysiology of April 2003 recommended that a post be developed in Limerick. The national task force on medical staffing recommended further neurological posts in the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have raised this issue by way of parliamentary question at least three times and we are still waiting for a most essential service in the mid-western region. It is not a question of wanting a specialty in every hospital but it has been recommended by national bodies set up to make such recommendations. It is not acceptable that we have waited so long for this important appointment. The experience of patients, many of whom have chronic illnesses, is distressing because they expect to be treated in their own region but instead must travel for treatment.</P>
        <P>On a separate issue, people in the mid west are deeply concerned that they no longer seem to have the same priority as neighbouring regions in regard to the siting of major health specialties and services. For example, breast screening will be run from Cork and Galway and radiotherapy services were provided only after local fund-raising for them, otherwise people would have had to go to other regions for the services. The region is no longer autonomous in respect of health services. The health centre for the mid west is in Galway, and all meetings are held there rather than in Limerick. The area is losing out on many health services. I wish to ensure the area does not lose out further but gets a neurologist and neurological team without delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. As Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan stated, she and I lobbied for years while we were on the former <Col N="1186"/>Mid-Western Health Board for the provision of neurology services in the mid west.</P>
        <P>As part of the Estimates for the health services in 2006, additional funding of &euro;3 million was allocated to the Health Service Executive specifically for the further development of neurology and neurophysiology services nationally. This funding was provided to allow the Health Service Executive to further progress the implementation of the recommendations made by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in respect of these services. The Comhairle report of the committee to review neurology and neurophysiology services recommended significant enhancement of services, including the appointment of additional consultants. While reaching the full complement of consultant posts as recommended will take some time, major improvements in patient care can be achieved in the short term through a combination of additional consultant posts and the appointment of a number of clinical nurse specialists and allied health professionals.</P>
        <P>A priority objective for the National Hospitals Office is to progress the implementation of the Comhairle report to address immediate service needs and to improve equity of access in the regions. This Department has been advised by the Health Service Executive that the development of three new neurology units will commence during 2006, one in the mid west, one in the north west and one in the south east, with the appointment of multidisciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The mid-western regional hospital has the services of a visiting consultant neurologist two days per month. The consultant provides an out-patient service for review or return patients and an inpatient consultation service. Due to pressure on the existing service, new patient referrals are forwarded to the neurological services at Cork, Galway or Dublin. ln view of the pressures, the development of neurology services at the mid-western regional hospital is an urgent priority for the Health Service Executive in 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Government is committed to the continued development of neurology services nationally. Resources have been made available to commence neurology services in Limerick and I am confident that the Health Service Executive will succeed in its objective to deliver these important services in 2006.</P>

      <sTitle>Missing Persons.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Friday the missing persons helpline was out of action for one year. When this service was introduced in 2002 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell said, &ldquo;For too long the crime victim was marginalised and treated as a mere spectator to the criminal justice process.&rdquo; He admitted that Ireland lagged behind other countries in terms of such services and said that although we were learning it was strange that we had not reached <Col N="1187"/>this stage previously. He described the service as a positive step and said, &ldquo;This service will provide invaluable advice and psychological support for families of missing persons&rdquo;. This was quoted in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>on 25 October 2002.</P>
        <P>In response to parliamentary questions tabled by several Deputies last January, the Minister quoted selectively from a report evaluating the helpline he had commissioned. Stating that there had been only 100 calls to the helpline between 2002 and 2003, he failed to provide the justification for its continued use in the same report and the reasons given for the number of calls. This gave the impression that the helpline was of limited value.</P>
        <P>The Minister recently criticised the selective use of statistics yet is himself guilty on this charge in respect of this issue.</P>
        <P>The report, An evaluation of the National Missing Persons Helpline, written in 2003 by Kevin Lalor and Kalis Pope, two social scientists in the Dublin Institute of Technology, made 12 recommendations. These were that funding for the helpline be continued, that the operation of the helpline under the auspices of Victim Support be continued and that a concerted effort be made to increase public awareness of the helpline through, for example, making the brochure available at citizens information centres, railway stations, airports, ferry bus terminals, public libraries, student unions and local newspapers at times when articles are being written about missing persons.</P>
        <P>Other recommendations in the report were that an advertising budget be identified, that the range of services for families of the missing be extended and that volunteers be recruited. According to the report, the missing persons helpline should be regarded as a first step. The report also refers to the importance of providing a professional counselling service to families of missing persons. It recommends the development of formaI service agreements between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Victim Support and quarterly meetings between the helpline operator, the Missing Persons Bureau and the Department.</P>
        <P>Another recommendation is the expansion of the remit of the helpline as &ldquo;a link between family and friends of missing persons&rdquo;. The report argued that while both the Missing Persons Association and the embryonic Missing in Ireland Support Service sprang up spontaneously in response to the lack of services for families and loved ones of missing persons, the greatest benefit would accrue from a single national voluntary body with close links to the missing persons helpline. According to the report, this would facilitate the creation of a critical mass which could evolve into a larger service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report recommended exploring the possibility of integrating the missing persons website with the helpline; inducting a small number of <Col N="1188"/>specialist volunteers into the helpline; offering the helpline as a free call service, as opposed to a lo-call service; and making regular and prolonged efforts to ensure that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are aware of the helpline. A total of 700 Garda stations were surveyed in November 2003, of which only 65% had a brochure on display. The report&rsquo;s final recommendation was that call records be computerised in anticipation of an increased number of calls to the helpline.</P>
        <P>Just over a month prior to its abandonment, the Minister communicated with my constituency colleague, Deputy Durkan, about the helpline. He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware of the missing persons helpline, which has been operating since October 2002. This is a dedicated helpline which is operated by Victim Support as a counselling and referral service and serves as a primary point of contact for the families of missing persons. The helpline provides advice and psychological support for families of missing persons as well as structured liaison with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister has catalogued problems with the Victim Support Organisation, which has now closed down. However, he cannot talk about the need for a service like the missing persons helpline and decide on a course of action, at a time when we are awash with money, that terminates the helpline. The Minister informed me that the number of people who remained untraced out of the 1,848 people who were reported missing in 1997 was three. However, this figure starkly contrasts with the 72 people who remained untraced at the end of 2005. These people were part of a group of 4,319 people who were reported missing during this year. A problem clearly exists, which is not the fault of Victim Support but is the result of the decision by the Minister to withdraw a service which needs to be restored, irrespective of whether it is an independent helpline or a service attached to a service organisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who, unfortunately, is unable to attend this debate. I assure the Deputy that the Minister and I share her concern and that of many members of the public with regard to missing persons.</P>
        <P>The national missing persons helpline was established in October 2002. Initially, funding of &euro;65,000, which included set-up costs, was provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish a dedicated national missing persons helpline to be operated and administered by Victim Support. Further funding of &euro;45,000 was provided to the helpline in 2003. The Deputy should bear in mind that this funding was subject to the conditions that no funding beyond the year 2003 should be implied and that audited accounts should be provided to the <Col N="1189"/>Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand that, to date, no audited accounts have been received in the Department.</P>
        <P>The conditions under which the Department provided funding did not include any requirements concerning the operational activities of the helpline, such as advertising and strategy, as referred to by the Deputy. Any decisions relating to the operation of the helpline were made by Victim Support, an independent, non-governmental organisation with charitable status, which managed the operation of the helpline, in conjunction with the helpline itself.</P>
        <P>In March 2005, following an independent review, the Minister decided that continued funding of Victim Support could no longer be justified due to serious concerns in respect of governance, accountability for public funds and poor service levels, following a lengthy period of instability within the organisation. I understand that Victim Support Limited closed down its headquarters during 2005 and that a number of staff were made redundant, including the person employed to operate the missing persons helpline. The Department had no role in the decision of Victim Support Limited to make a number of its staff redundant, other than to insist that statutory requirements, such as notice, holiday pay etc., were met and the interests of the staff protected.</P>
        <P>In March 2005, the Minister established a new commission for the support of victims of crime to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures. The commission is entirely independent in its decision making and examines each application on its merits. Its members are Mr. Jim McHugh, retired assistant commissioner in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who is the chairman; Ms Nora Owen, former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Mr. Sean Lowry, former head of the Probation and Welfare Service; Mr. Michael Whelan, Gemini Consulting; and Ms Marian Finucane, who is a broadcaster.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The commission received an application from the Missing ln Ireland Support Service for &euro;71,600 to establish, staff and operate a helpline for missing persons. After careful consideration of the application, the commission decided to offer funding of &euro;25,000. However, this offer was rejected by the Missing in Ireland Support Service on the basis that it would accept only the full amount sought. In this context, it should be borne in mind that the commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime and that while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most missing persons are not. Other than the request to the independent commission for funding, no request for funding has been made by the helpline to the Department. It remains open to the Missing In Ireland Support Service to make an application to the Department for assistance if it so wishes. Any such application will be carefully considered on its merits.</P><Col N="1190"/>
        <P>The missing persons bureau in Garda headquarters is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons. All cases of a person reported missing in suspicious circumstances remain open and under ongoing review and investigation until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect is made by a coroner.</P>
        <P>At present, local Garda management take direct responsibility for missing person cases and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary. All missing persons are recorded on the PULSE system. When a person is reported missing, the local Garda superintendent takes direct responsibility for the investigation and appoints an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary &mdash; for example, the national bureau of criminal investigation or the technical bureau. The systems put in place by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to manage and deal with reports of missing persons are in line with the best international police practice and Garda management is satisfied and has assured the Minister that the systems in place are adequate to deal with any reported case of a missing person.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na interacts fully and as appropriate with all media outlets &mdash; print, radio and TV &mdash; in highlighting cases involving missing persons. The services of other external agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation. In addition, every Garda district has a specially trained search team that is familiar with the locality. The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated subject on the curriculum at the Garda College, Templemore, and is covered during in-service training.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise the issue of rail freight services in Ireland. The Irish freight market was opened by the Government on 1 January 2006 to allow the private sector to become involved in it. However, there is little evidence that the market has been opened by Government measures. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann held a contract from Diageo to transport Guinness to the west. Three trains brought Guinness to the west each week. That contract has been lost and 19 or 20 articulated trucks will bring Guinness into the west.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent weeks we have listened to the Government preaching about road safety and the volume of traffic on our roads, yet our rail service is being underused. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has been given the job of running the country&rsquo;s rail freight services but has failed. If the Government does not step in soon, there will be no rail freight business left because Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will have lost the contracts. Freight services and staff will be lost and more vehicles will be on the roads. If Guinness can be carried by road more cheaply, it is daft of the Government to allow this to happen <Col N="1191"/>when Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann should be able to compete. For many years it has had the contract to deliver Guinness all over Connacht but 25 jobs will be lost and more transporters will be on our roads.</P>
        <P>What efforts has the Government made to get people in the private sector involved now that the rail freight market has been opened? Has anyone taken up the offer? What has the Government done to take more trucks off of the roads to improve road safety?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should be using the rail freight service. I do not want to see more rail lines closed down, such as the western rail corridor, and people seeking in 20 years to have these services re-opened. The infrastructure is in place and it is time for the Government to take the necessary action, including the introduction of legislation to this House. If Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is not prepared to deal with the rail freight service, it should be handed to the private sector, which would be glad to run it at a profit. I cannot understand why the company could not compete for the contract, having had it for so many years. I believe Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann does not want anything more to do with freight. It wants only the passenger services.</P>
        <P>The Government cannot preach to the people, bring in penalty points, tell us that there are too many cars on the roads or ask why people do not use public services when a company is not able to look for new businesss and has lost its existing business. I hope the Government will step in and do something about this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to outline what the Department is doing. The strategic rail review commissioned by my Department contained a comprehensive examination of the rail freight business and its realistic potential to support economic development and contribute to sustainable development.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, in responding to the challenges contained in the review, developed a business plan with regard to freight. The company&rsquo;s goal is to return the rail freight business to profitability. To help achieve this turnaround, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann recently withdrew from loss making groupage, palletised and single container rail transport. It continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present.</P>
        <P>Since 1999, larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has invested more than &euro;1.5 billion in rebuilding the railways with Government and EU support for the investment programme. This has delivered improvements in new trains, upgraded infrastructure and customer facilities. While such investment has primarily focused on improving passenger services, the investment in improving rail infrastructure also has a direct beneficial impact on freight activities.</P>
        <P>Against this background, two recent developments &mdash; the closure of the sugar beet factory <Col N="1192"/>in Mallow and the loss of the Diageo contract &mdash; represent a setback to recent Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s efforts to develop its freight business. Following the closure of the sugar factory last year, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann increased its annual transport of sugar beet from approximately 150,000 tonnes to 313,000 tonnes in 2005. The demise of the sugar beet transport marks the regrettable end of a long and successful association.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Diageo contract, larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has informed me that Diageo carried out a tendering process last year for all of its logistics business and has decided that it will not be renewing the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann contract for this business as it received an offer that is significantly lower than current rail freight rates by alternative road-based suppliers. Improvements in road infrastructure as well as a decline in the sale of draught beer have made the distribution of kegs by rail uncompetitive with road haulage.</P>
        <P>Despite these setbacks, larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will continue to pursue viable trainload traffic. The company has made progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, including mineral ore and pulpwood. For example, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has increased the trainload pulpwood business by modifying surplus wagons and providing additional services for Coillte between the west and the south east. It has recently altered rail schedules and is currently providing three additional trains per week for Tara Mines, with a potential to carry an extra 85,000 tonnes of lead and zinc between Navan and Dublin Port per annum. It has modified surplus platform wagons to provide a trainload service for containers between Ballina and Waterford Port. This new service, initially two trains per week, is due to commence on 21 April.</P>
        <P>The position regarding competition in the rail freight market is that the Minister for Transporter, Deputy Cullen, introduced the European Communities (Access to Railway Infrastructure) (Amendment) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 780 of 2005), implementing EU Directive 2004/51 on the development of the Community&rsquo;s railways. These regulations allow for the opening of the rail freight market to competition from 1 January 2006 in the case of international freight, and from 1 January 2007 in the case of domestic freight operations. Under the regulations, the market is open to foreign operators. My Department has received a communication from a UK operator stating its intention to establish itself as a freight operator. The Department has been in touch with the operator but a formal application has not been received to date.</P>
        <P>larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has undertaken extensive engagement with industry and transporters around the country to try to identify long-term sustainable business opportunities. It has had genuine difficulty in identifying business opportunities that offer reasonable volumes of business on a regular basis. It is not feasible to run trains <Col N="1193"/>with one or two containers and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has not identified sufficient business to group a number of separate activities together to form a viable trainload. Most Irish industry is focused on &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; transport and as our road network continues to expand and improve across the country, the role of rail freight becomes more problematic because all rail journeys involve road movements at each end of the logistics chain. Furthermore, distances in Ireland are short. The experience across Europe is no different. Rail freight activities are most economic where distances are long, where there are large volumes to be transported and where the freight to be carried is not time sensitive.</P>
        <P>The Minister is open to any views on how we can expand rail freight but the business environment is such that he has not seen any real opportunities identified. The market for rail freight will be fully liberalised in a matter of months and if there were opportunities, expressions of interest would be welcomed. The possibility of providing capital funding for sidings is often mentioned as a stimulus to rail freight but no firm proposals have been received.</P>

      <sTitle>Decentralisation Programme.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DonalMoynihan"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a gabh&aacute;il leat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, de bharr cead a thabhairt dom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; anseo mar gheall ar decentralisation. The Government decided on a major decentralisation programme in the first week of December 2003. My concern is that, since that time, little has happened in various locations in practical terms, particularly in Macroom where I live and which I represent. However, there have been a number of reports in the meantime from decentralisation and communication groups, from which it appears that very little has happened in practical terms in Macroom.</P>
        <P>Macroom did not come to the fore in the previous report and it was a matter of great disappointment to me and the people of the town that it was down the list regarding progress in decentralisation. Macroom was not included in the first 15 projects to be relocated and it is of the utmost importance that it is included in the next report. I thank the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, for keeping me updated regarding the accommodation brief in respect of the new laboratories which has been finalised within her Department.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Office of Public Works was given prime responsibility for delivering the property aspects of the decentralisation programme. This matter is urgent because the site on which the present laboratories stand on Model Farm Road has been earmarked for housing. Therefore, the laboratories which have been earmarked for Macroom must be relocated urgently. The relocation of the laboratories from Model Farm Road provides the Department with <Col N="1194"/>an ideal opportunity to consolidate its laboratory operations in the southern region. This will involve the three laboratories in Cork, as well as two in Limerick, and I am pleased that Macroom will be recognised as the regional veterinary headquarters for Munster.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to outline the progress made by the Office of Public Works in acquiring a suitable site or property. If such a suitable site or property has been earmarked, when can we expect accommodation to be made available for those departmental staff who volunteer to decentralise to the Macroom area? When will work commence on the programme to provide those facilities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas dhuit, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as deis a thabhairt dom a chur in i&uacute;l don D&aacute;il agus an Teachta Donal Moynihan cad at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh ag an mbomaite i Maigh Chromtha.</P>
        <P>The construction of a laboratory complex in Macroom is part of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. It involves the rationalisation of the laboratories currently located in the Munster region into one new laboratory complex in Macroom. These laboratories consist of a dairy science laboratory, a regional veterinary laboratory and a brucellosis laboratory on Model Farm Road, Cork, a dairy science laboratory on Killeely Road, Limerick and a regional veterinary laboratory in Knockalisheen, Limerick.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although these laboratory facilities were adequate for their time, the technology, regulatory and testing requirements etc. have changed significantly since they were built. The Department considers that building a new state-of-the-art facility on a greenfield site will allow it to amalgamate the two existing laboratories in Limerick and the three in Cork into a single efficient and modern complex which will allow the Department to continue to meet its commitments to food safety into the future, allow the laboratories to achieve accreditation status which is essential if they are to continue to carry out their work, facilitate compliance with EU regulation, allow the achievement of efficiencies and align the Department&rsquo;s facilities to the changing structure of the agriculture and food sector.</P>
        <P>Many factors favour the new proposals, such as the fact that little investment has been made in the Munster laboratories in the past decade. Moreover, the laboratories are not accredited and updating them to achieve accreditation status would be expensive. In addition, the Department&rsquo;s laboratory operations are subject to many EU regulations and accreditation requirements and it is necessary for them to have the appropriate accreditation status to be allowed to continue their work.</P>
        <P>A Government decision taken on 28 December 2003 agreed to allocate the Model Farm Road site to the affordable housing initiative. The Govern<Col N="1195"/>ment&rsquo;s decentralisation programme committed the Department of Agriculture and Food to relocate 70 staff members to Macroom.</P>
        <P>The decentralisation implementation group, DIG, report of June 2005 provided for an indicative construction start of the end of 2007 for Macroom, with an indicative completion time of early 2009. The Department of Agriculture and Food has forwarded an accommodation brief for the Macroom laboratory to the Office of Public Works. The brief outlines the requirements for office staff, laboratories, visitor areas and general service areas for the new laboratory complex. Given the complexities of the facility, that brief is preliminary and will be adjusted as specific requirements are finalised. Communication between my Department and the Office of Public Works regarding the brief is ongoing. This preliminary brief will, however, allow the Office of Public Works to source a site for the facility. The selection of the site or property and the com<Col N="1196"/>pletion of the development will be a matter for the Office of Public Works, which will submit an application for planning permission in due<?oasys _jy ?>course.</P>
        <P>As with decentralisation generally, the relocation of staff from their current location to the new complex in Macroom is voluntary. Human resource and industrial relations issues relating to decentralisation are dealt with centrally by the Department of Finance. It has recently begun discussions with the staff associations of professional and technical civil servants. My Department has indicated to the Department of Finance that as well as dealing with the issue of specialised staff who wish to remain in Dublin after decentralisation, any staff who do not want to move from the existing laboratories in Cork and Limerick must be considered.</P>
        <P>I will keep the Deputy updated and will apprise him of progress in the matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 52, 83 and 93 together.</P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair met at Farmleigh on 26 January last, they said that 2006 would be the decisive year for the peace process. Almost eight years on from the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and more than three years since the suspension of the institutions, it is now time that political power and <Col N="1198"/>responsibility is returned to a fully functioning Assembly and Executive and that Northern Ireland politicians begin to do the work they were elected to do. This is what the people in Northern Ireland want to see happen and it is what the two Governments have committed themselves to achieve this year.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair will meet in Armagh on Thursday, 6 April to set out the Governments&rsquo; joint strategy for a fully functioning Assembly and Executive, and nothing less than that, in 2006. Work on these proposals is ongoing, and I do not want to anticipate the precise details of what will be announced on Thursday. I can say, however, that the Assembly will be recalled in mid-May and asked to begin immediately to prepare for Government and to elect an Executive within six weeks.</P>
        <P>We are fully aware that there are obstacles to progress that need to be addressed and resolved. This can only be done by the parties themselves. Our aim is to create the circumstances in which they can deal with any obstacles and prepare for Government. If the parties cannot overcome these obstacles in six weeks, we are prepared to give the Assembly some additional time, but for a strictly limited period and for the express purpose of implementing the Agreement and electing an Executive.</P>
        <P>Whether we are successful in achieving this objective is ultimately the responsibility of the parties themselves. If, within that strictly limited period, the parties collectively are unable to implement the Agreement, then the Governments will have to exercise our responsibilities and ensure that the Agreement is implemented to the maximum possible extent for the benefit of all communities.</P>
        <P>The North-South arrangements would be particularly important in that context. They are a vital pillar of the Good Friday Agreement. The North-South Bodies established under the Agreement continue to carry out important public functions and have shown the value of having dedicated institutions to pursue common goals for mutual benefit. The Government is fully committed to advancing North-South co-operation for the benefit of all the people on the island.</P>
        <P>Our focus now is on taking the necessary steps which will lead to restoration of all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, including the North-South Ministerial Council. As I have said, if we are faced with a situation where we have to conclude that fully-functioning institutions are not in prospect this year, then the two Governments will have no choice but to act to sustain the Agreement, including its provisions on North-South co-operation, to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P>We are now at a critical juncture. The difficult decisions in the coming days and weeks will be for the parties. We believe our joint strategy represents the best opportunity to pave the way for the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland this year. We will be asking all <Col N="1199"/>of the parties to consider it carefully and, most importantly, to give it the opportunity to succeed.</P>

        <Quest>if, during his discussions with US Administration officials while in the USA recently, the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan arose; and his views and the view of the Government regarding this case which, it is claimed, illustrates the US Administration&rsquo;s flaunting of basic military protection in setting up tribunals dealing with suspected Al-Qaeda suspects.</Quest>

	<P>The Taoiseach raised our concerns regarding Guantanamo Bay at his meeting with President Bush in Washington on 17 March 2006, which I also attended. President Bush said that he fully understood the Taoiseach&rsquo;s concerns and that he would also like to close the detention facility when possible. The President also noted that his Administration was awaiting a ruling by the US Supreme Court on the use of army tribunals to try detainees in Guantanamo. I understand that the case referred to was Hamdan <i>v.</i> Rumsfeld, which came before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, 28 March 2006 and which challenges the legality of President Bush&rsquo;s 2001 military order establishing military commissions to try terrorist suspects. The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision is expected in July 2006.</P>
        <P>The Government has raised the issue of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay with the US authorities on numerous other occasions. We believe that those detained in Guantanamo must be treated in accordance with the requirements of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. This position is shared by the EU as a whole. I have also made it clear that I fully endorse the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s view that those held in Guantanamo Bay should either be charged or released, and that the US should close this facility. While we continue to press for the closure of the Guantanamo facility and for respect for the principles of international law, the legality of the 2001 military order under US law is a matter for the US courts to determine.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 95, 144 and 281 together.</P>
        <P>In its declaration of 24 March the European Council stated: &ldquo;On a continent of open and democratic societies, Belarus is a sad exception&rdquo;. Ireland and the European Union deplore the long-standing failure of the Belorussian authorities to meet their OSCE commitments to democratic elections. In light of the findings of the OSCE-ODIHR international election observation mission, we view the presidential elections of 19 March as fundamentally flawed.</P>
        <P>The EU has repeatedly made clear that if the Belarus authorities were to reverse their policies and embark on fundamental democratic and economic reforms, their country could have the benefit of closer economic integration and political co-operation with the EU under the European neighbourhood policy. I sincerely regret that the presidential elections have not advanced this prospect and that the opportunity they offered to the people of Belarus has once again been missed.</P>
        <P>Ireland and our EU and international partners are watching developments closely. The arrest and sentencing of Belorussian citizens and others who peacefully exercised their right of assembly and freedom of expression to protest the flawed election results shows the disregard of the Belorussian leadership for civil and political rights. I repeat the demand of the European Council for the immediate release of all those detained. I call on the Belarus authorities to refrain from further harassment or intimidation of those who, in the context of the presidential election, used peaceful means to try to develop civil society and advance democracy in Belarus. The European Council welcomed the message of hope brought by the democratic opposition and civil society and it reiterated the commitment of the European Union to engage with Belorussian society by further strengthening its support for civil society and for democratisation. I fully endorse this approach and will ensure that <Col N="1201"/>Ireland plays its part in working with partners to promote the process of democratic change. The people of Belarus must not be isolated from Europe by the policy of their leaders. It will be important therefore to intensify people-to-people contacts and to try to enhance access to independent sources of information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Government&rsquo;s long-standing concern about the human rights situation in Belarus is well known to the Belarus authorities. It is communicated mainly through EU channels but also bilaterally by the Irish embassy in Moscow, which is accredited to Belarus, and in diplomatic contacts with the Embassy of Belarus in London. Ireland supported strongly the series of declarations on Belarus made by the EU before and since the presidential elections.</P>
        <P>The European Council on 24 March decided to take restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards, including President Lukashenko. Intensive work is under way and the Presidency hopes that a first measure, in the form of an expanded visa ban list, can be adopted at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 April. Ireland is working to ensure that the EU response is targeted and proportionate. It must be directed against the responsible authorities, not against the ordinary people of Belarus. It must also be adaptable in light of future actions by the Belarus authorities, positive as well as negative.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 100, 115 and 280 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of reports that are circulating on the issues raised. As I stated in response to a written question on this issue on 29 March, I am unable at present to confirm the reliability of these reports. I have asked my Department, in particular through the embassy in Beijing, to look into the situation as a matter of urgency and to report back to me. We are also making inquiries within the EU framework. Without prejudice to the outcome of the above inquiries, Ireland and the EU remain concerned about the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in China and have raised our concerns with the Chinese Government on many occasions.</P>
        <P>Human rights issues are a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities at both bilateral and European Union level. In our bilateral exchanges, human rights concerns were raised most recently with the Chinese Government during the visit of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to China for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day last month. At EU level, the EU-China human rights dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises its concerns with China about individual human rights cases and more general issues such as freedom of expression and the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
        <P>At the latest round of the human rights dialogue, held in Beijing on 24 October 2005, the EU raised, <i>inter alia</i>, the right to freedom of religion and the need for reform of the administrative detention system, including the associated re-education through labour, RTL, camps. The EU expressed particular concern in this regard for Falun Gong members and stated that reform of the RTL system is an issue of fundamental importance for the EU in the human rights dialogue. A number of Falun Gong practitioners were also included in the EU&rsquo;s list of individual cases of concern which was submitted to the Chinese authorities during the dialogue. The next round of the dialogue will take place in Vienna in May.</P>

	<P>I participated at the European Council in Brussels on 23 and 24 March 2006, at which the Irish delegation was led by the Taoiseach. The conclusions of the Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann had an opportunity to discuss the meeting&rsquo;s outcome on 29 March.</P>
        <P>The Council&rsquo;s discussions covered matters across the Union&rsquo;s broad economic and social agenda. In particular, the Council endorsed the idea of a new energy policy for Europe, an initiative Ireland wholeheartedly supported. I should emphasise also that the conclusions make it explicitly clear that decisions on the primary sources of energy, and the choice of energy mix, will remain the responsibility of member states.</P>
        <P>On state aids, we secured the inclusion of a text which reflects our long-standing view that the EU&rsquo;s rules in this area need to take external factors into account so as to enable Europe to compete successfully for future inward investment. The Taoiseach also won support for his proposal that the EU should look at ways of reducing mobile phone roaming charges for travellers within the Union.</P>
        <P>At Foreign Minister level, the particular focus of our discussions was on the future of Europe and on enlargement. In this regard, I took the opportunity to underline our continuing and firm commitment to the EU constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to future enlargement, I said that we would continue to adopt a constructive and pragmatic approach, while giving due weight to the Union&rsquo;s absorption capacity and the need for future candidates to be able to meet fully the obligations of membership. While the Presidency did not seek to arrive at any conclusions on these topics, our discussion was a useful contribution to the current &ldquo;period of reflection&rdquo;, which is to be reviewed by the Heads of State and Government when they next meet in June.</P>
        <P>I raised the recent ETA ceasefire, and complimented the Spanish Government on its facilitation of this breakthrough. I indicated our willingness to assist the Spanish Government based on our own peace process experience and, in this context, the Taoiseach invited Prime Minister Zapatero to visit Ireland at an early opportunity.</P>
        <P>I also referred to the question of Guantanamo Bay, and was one of a number of Ministers who exhorted the Presidency to issue a statement expressing the EU&rsquo;s concerns about the continued operation of the facility and urging its closure.</P>

        <P>I am aware of the concerns of the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in relation to decentralisation. These concerns were most recently set out in a letter received from Dochas, the umbrella organisation which represents Irish NGOs involved in development overseas, to which my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, replied on 31 January. In his letter, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, stated that decentralisation is a Government decision to which we are committed. My departmental officials are currently involved in detailed planning and implementation of the decentralisation project. We look forward to continued engagement and co-operation with NGOs throughout the process of decentralisation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 67, 70, 136 and 273 together.</P>
        <P>The international community has adopted a clear and united approach in relation to the outcome of the democratic Palestinian elections on 25 January and the approval of a new Government by the Palestinian Legislative Council on 28 March. The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended on 30 January, emphasised that violence and terror are incompatible with the democratic process. It urged Hamas and all other factions to renounce violence, to recognise Israel&rsquo;s right to exist, and to disarm. The Council also encouraged the formation of a Government committed to a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the conflict, based on existing agreements and on the terms of the roadmap. On the same day, the international Quartet, representing the European Union, the United Nations, the United States and Russia, set out the conditions for engagement with the new Palestinian Government. The Quartet stated that all members of a future Palestinian Government must be committed to non-violence, to recognition of Israel and to acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including those of the road map.</P>
        <P>Last week, on 30 March, the Quartet welcomed the efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to ensure that the new Palestinian Government commits to a platform of peace, but noted with grave concern that it has not committed itself to the principles set out by the international community. The Quartet encouraged continued humanitarian assistance to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian people but reiterated that future assistance to the Palestinian Authority will be reviewed by donors against the Government&rsquo;s commitment to these principles.</P>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council will review developments at its meeting in Luxembourg next Monday. The EU is the largest donor to the Palestinian Authority and to the Palestinian people. The Council, on 27 February, agreed to the early disbursement of over &euro;120 million in assistance. Obviously, future decisions will depend on the approach adopted by the Hamas Government. I continue to hope that it will listen to, and act on, the message it has received from President Abbas, its neighbours in the region and the wider international community. I can assure the Deputies that if there is any evidence of a willingness to make progress on the steps set out by the EU and the Quartet, <Col N="1206"/>based unequivocally on the continued absence of violence, I will strongly urge a response from the EU.</P>
        <P>The Council will also consider developments since the Israeli general elections. I have offered my congratulations to Acting Prime Minister Olmert on the success of his party, Kadima. It appears that he and the other Israeli political leaders will need some time to negotiate the formation of a new coalition Government.</P>
        <P>I believe that nothing which has happened in the region in recent months alters the basic reality that the only way in which a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflict can be found is through the negotiation of a mutually acceptable and viable two-State solution. This must involve the co-existence in peace and security of the state of Israel and a truly viable Palestinian state. The principles and steps contained in the Quartet roadmap continue to provide the framework for such a solution.</P>
        <P>I therefore welcome the statement by Acting Prime Minister Olmert last week that there is no good alternative to a peace agreement and that his Government will work for a negotiated agreement with their Palestinian neighbours. The Government, and our partners in the EU, look forward to developing a good working relationship with the new Israeli Government. We will continue to work for early progress based on the implementation of commitments under the roadmap, and under international law. I will also continue to raise directly with the Israeli Government our concerns, which are shared by our EU partners, on Israeli policies and activities in the occupied territories, which are contrary to international law and which threaten to undermine a solution based on the co-existence of two viable states.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government is committed to the provision of humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people. Since 2003, Ireland has delivered over &euro;6.5 million to meet the immediate emergency humanitarian needs of some of the most vulnerable groups in that country. Funding has been delivered through key non-governmental partners such as Concern, GOAL and Tr&oacute;caire and through UN and international agencies such as the world food programme, the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund, UNICEF, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA, and the Red Cross family.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Irish Aid also supports the work of the NGO Co-ordination Committee in Iraq, NCCI, which provides a forum for collective NGO activity to enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian action <Col N="1207"/>in Iraq at a national level. Funding was also provided to the AMAR, Assisting Marsh Arabs and Refugees, International Charitable Foundation for health care programmes to assist the Marsh Arab population of southern Iraq, which suffered considerably under the former regime.</P>
        <P>While the security situation in Iraq has greatly increased the difficulty for those working in the humanitarian field, the Government remains committed to funding humanitarian programmes which can be delivered in this challenging environment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 288 together.</P>
        <P>As I made clear in a statement issued on 27 March, I am greatly encouraged by the findings of the OSCE&rsquo;s international election observer mission on the parliamentary elections in Ukraine. The mission found that the elections of 26 March further consolidated the democratic breakthrough that began less than a year and a half ago in Ukraine and that, overall, fundamen<Col N="1208"/>tal civil and political rights were respected. An inclusive candidate registration process and a vibrant media environment provided for genuine competition in conditions of equality, enabling voters to express their will freely and fairly. The OSCE-ODIHR mission was one of the largest in the region in recent times, with more than 900 observers. Ireland contributed nine observers, including one Member of this house, Deputy Perry.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the President, the Government and the people of Ukraine on the freest and fairest elections since their country&rsquo;s independence. As the EU has noted, their achievement set a new and very welcome standard for elections in the region as a whole.</P>
        <P>It would be premature to comment on prospects for the future governance of Ukraine. Following the country&rsquo;s democratic elections, Ireland and the EU will co-operate with whatever government is formed in Kiev. We all hope that a majority-backed government will be formed soon and we expect it to confirm and maintain the democratic achievements of the past 15 months.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that the Our Ukraine party of President Yushchenko lost ground in the elections while the Party of Regions of his former rival for the Presidency, Viktor Yanukovich, became the largest grouping. However, other pro-reform parties either held or substantially increased their vote, making the combined strength of the constituent elements of the former Orange coalition greater than that of the non-Orange parties. The make up of a new government is now a matter for negotiation between the various party leaders and no possible combination can be ruled out at this stage.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the European Union look forward to working towards a deeper partnership with Ukraine, one that is built on shared values as expressed in the quality of Ukraine&rsquo;s democracy. As long as Ukraine adheres to the path of political and economic reform, it can count on our support and assistance. Continuing implementation of the action plan under the European neighbourhood policy agreed with Ukraine in February 2005 is vital.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 73 and 143 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland takes a consistently strong position on Burma in relevant contacts, in the European Union framework and at the United Nations. Together with our EU partners, we avail of all opportunities to condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Burma and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EU applies a range of sanctions and restrictive measures against Burma, referred to as the EU common position, which are due to expire on 30 April and which are currently up for renewal. In view of the absence of any progress in Burma, Ireland is strongly supporting the renewal of the measures for a further year. I am confident that this will happen.</P>
        <P>The most recent EU meeting with Burma was an EU-Burma informal Troika meeting at official level, held in London on 30 November in the margins of the Asia-Europe senior officials meeting, at which my Department was represented. The EU side recalled our concern at the situation in Burma and the EU&rsquo;s desire to see real progress in the roadmap towards democracy. It called for the immediate release of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi.</P>
        <P>I was delighted that the Olof Palme Memorial Fund in Sweden, established in memory of the assassinated former Swedish Prime Minister, awarded Aung San Suu Kyi the Olof Palme Prize 2005 for her unyielding fight for a democratic Burma. The prize was received on her behalf at a ceremony in Stockholm on 28 February. The Nobel laureate has previously been honoured with the freedom of both Dublin and Galway cities. The EU issued a statement on 28 February acknowledging Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s tireless peaceful struggle and deeply regretting that the deprival of her personal freedom prevented her from accepting the award in person. It urged her immediate release and that of all other political prisoners. It also reiterated the EU&rsquo;s commitment to supporting national reconciliation and respect for human rights and democracy in Burma. It called on the Burmese r&eacute;gime to enter into a genuine dialogue with the National League for Democracy and with ethnic representatives.</P>
        <P>Ireland announced the establishment of diplomatic relations on a non-resident basis with Burma on 13 February 2004. However, given that the progress which had been anticipated in 2004, most notably the meeting of an open and unhindered national convention and the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, did not materialise, the Government decided to put on hold the exchange of ambassadors. Any decision to proceed with an exchange of ambassadors with Burma will have to await positive and significant moves by the Burmese Government.</P><Col N="1210"/>
        <P>I assure the Deputies that I will continue to raise concerns about Burma on all possible occasions and to work for real progress there.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 79 and 134 and together.</P>
        <P>Kenya and its neighbouring countries in the Horn of Africa are in the grip of a severe drought that is directly affecting up to 11 million people across the region. The drought has already killed thousands of livestock, depriving people of their livelihoods and leaving pastoral communities destitute. The impact of poor rainfall during the long rainy season of March to June last year has been compounded by the failure of the short rains in October-December. It is now estimated that 5 million people in Kenya alone now require food aid. Over 2.5 million Ethiopians and over 2 million Somalis are directly at risk. In addition, populations are suffering the effects of the drought in parts of Burundi, Djibouti and Eritrea.</P>
        <P>Ireland has responded promptly to this emergency. In early February, over &euro;5 million in emergency humanitarian funding was provided to agencies working in the Horn of Africa. A total of &euro;3 million of this funding has been provided to the regional emergency response programmes of UN agencies and the International Federation of the Red Cross, while funding of over &euro;1 million has been provided for Somalia and almost &euro;1 million has been provided to the NGOs Concern and Tr&oacute;caire for emergency programmes specifically in Kenya.</P>
        <P>I have continued to monitor developments closely and have decided to make available further funding of &euro;2 million. This will be allocated to key NGOs and international organisations working in response to the emergency, particularly in Somalia where there is the added <Col N="1211"/>challenge of providing humanitarian relief in an environment of intense insecurity.</P>
        <P>At EU level, the European Commission announced last week that it is providing a further &euro;5 million in emergency humanitarian aid to the affected region. This brings the Commission&rsquo;s total response to the drought in the region to &euro;78 million, including &euro;17 million in emergency response to the crisis.</P>
        <P>In terms of strengthening the UN&rsquo;s capacity to respond to such crises, Ireland has also contributed &euro;10 million to the central emergency response fund, CERF. Ireland played an active role, with a number of other countries, in advancing the proposal to set up the new CERF. This new mechanism provides UN agencies with a stand-by, grant-based fund to enable them to respond quickly to humanitarian emergencies.</P>
        <P>This fund will ensure a more predictable and timely response to humanitarian crisis. For these reasons, it is vitally important that all Governments contribute to the best of their ability to the CERF and help close the gap between the assessment of humanitarian needs and the release of funds essential to meeting them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 118 together.</P>
        <P>On 29 March 2006, Mr. Charles Taylor, former President of Liberia, was arrested in Nigeria, having violated the terms of his exile there, and moved via Liberia to the custody of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Irish members of the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, provided an air escort for Mr. Taylor from Liberia to Sierra Leone and delivered him to the Special Court. The Government is proud of the important role played by the Defence Forces in bringing Mr. Taylor to account.</P>
        <P>Liberia has made remarkable progress since the comprehensive peace agreement of August 2003. The parliamentary and presidential elections held in October 2005 marked the return of democracy to the country after 14 years of civil war. The extradition of Mr. Taylor further con<Col N="1212"/>solidates the new democratic dispensation in Liberia. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, visited Liberia last week and I requested him to convey the congratulations of the Government to President Ellen Sirleaf-<?oasys _jy ?>Johnson when he met with her on 30 March 2006. The fact that this extradition was undertaken in a spirit of regional co-operation between Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone augurs well for future peace in the region.</P>
        <P>The Special Court for Sierra Leone was set up in 2002 following a request from the Government of Sierra Leone to the UN that the international community try those with greatest responsibility for the violent conflict that took place there between 1996 and 2002. Mr. Taylor is one of the most high profile indictees. He is indicted on 11 charges related to his support of rebel armed forces in Sierra Leone. These include war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international law including sexual slavery, mutilations and the use of child soldiers.</P>
        <P>At the request of the Special Court, the Netherlands and the International Criminal Court, ICC, have agreed to host his trial on condition that the UN Security Council passes an authorising resolution. Measures are in hand to secure swift agreement on such a resolution in New York. The Netherlands also asked that a third country would accept Mr. Taylor once a verdict had been delivered and that the Special Court would make its own arrangements to use the facilities of the ICC. The trial will remain at all times under the jurisdiction of the Special Court.</P>
        <P>I understand that the request to transfer Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s trial to The Hague was prompted by fears that his presence in Sierra Leone could provoke unrest in the region. On 30 March 2006, President Johnson-Sirleaf expressed support for the transfer and extended an invitation to all former associates of Mr. Taylor against whom there is no charge to return and live freely in Liberia. She also reiterated her determination to pursue an agenda dedicated to bringing prosperity and development to Liberia.</P>
        <P>Ireland strongly supports the Special Court and has contributed over &euro;1 million to it. An Irish judge, Ms Therese Doherty, sits on the court and is expected to preside over Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s trial.</P>

	<P>The strong commitment of the Government to support our community abroad is reflected in the unprecedented level of funding secured for emigrant services. This year, &euro;12 million is available for this purpose which represents an increase of 45% on 2005.</P>
        <P>The needs of our Irish community in Britain are a particular priority for the Government. In 2005, groups in Britain received grants from my Department amounting to &euro;7.06 million. I am delighted that the number of grant recipients increased from 58 in 2004 to 118 in 2005. The very significant increase in funding and the rise in the number of grant recipients reflect, in the clearest possible way, the strength of the Government&rsquo;s firm and sustained commitment to our community in Britain.</P>
        <P>While the primary emphasis of funding continues to be on supporting frontline welfare services, I am pleased that additional funding has also made it possible to support a number of capital projects as well as projects which support our community in Britain in their wish to express their Irish identity.</P>
        <P>The following table gives details of the grants that I approved last year to organisations based in Britain. Applications for grants are currently under consideration and I look forward to making an announcement in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 76, 82, 125, and 282 together.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport represented the Government at an extensive programme of events in New York over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period. The 69th infantry battalion, the Fighting 69th, is the US army unit with the closest ties to Irish America and has led the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade on Fifth Avenue for more than 150 years. The 69th has recently returned from a tour of duty in Iraq. This year&rsquo;s parade was dedicated to the regiment, and the regiment was also guest of honour at the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Mass celebrated by Cardinal Egan in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral.</P>
        <P>As part of his programme, the Minister was invited to attend and speak at a public wreath-laying ceremony at the Father Duffy statue in Times Square. The ceremony was organised to commemorate the tens of thousands of New Yorkers who have served with the 69th. The battalion was formed by Irish immigrants in New York in 1851 and its battle flag was presented to the Irish nation by President Kennedy when he addressed the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1963. The flag is on permanent display in this building.</P>
        <P>Given the historical links as well as the focus on the 69th at the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events in New <Col N="1217"/>York this year, the Minister&rsquo;s attendance at the wreath-laying was entirely appropriate. The Fighting 69th is held in affection and respect by Irish America and the Minister&rsquo;s attendance at the public ceremony was deeply appreciated by the community.</P>
        <P>As regards the broader issue of the participation of Government representatives in ceremonies of this kind, this is decided on a case by case basis depending on specific circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With respect to the multinational forces currently serving in Iraq, I would point out that they are operating at the request of the Iraqi Government and under UN mandate. The presence of the multinational force in Iraq was authorised by the UN Security Council in Resolution 1511 of October 2003. This authorisation was reaffirmed in Resolution 1546 of June 2004, and was extended to the end of 2006 by Resolution 1637, which was adopted unanimously by the Security Council in November 2005.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 86 together.</P>
        <P>While the resolution establishing the Human Rights Council did not contain all that Ireland or Amnesty International had hoped for, it represents a clear improvement on the Commission on Human Rights and was the best compromise possible. The resolution was supported by 170 states, including Ireland and our EU partners, with only four states opposed and three abstaining. It was also endorsed by the Secretary General of the United Nations and the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In addition, Amnesty International and other prominent international human rights NGOs favoured the resolution.</P>
        <P>I was particularly aware of the desire for reform in the area of human rights while serving as envoy for the UN Secretary General on reform last year. Ireland played a very active role in the long process of negotiation which led to the establishment of the Human Rights Council on 15 March 2006 and was to the fore in working to guarantee a common EU position in favour of the resolution.</P><Col N="1218"/>
        <P>In addition to preserving some of the best features of the Commission on Human Rights, such as its system of special procedures and dialogue with NGOs, the Human Rights Council will have a number of notable new features: it will be a standing body that will meet more frequently during the year; it will periodically examine the observance of human rights by all UN member states; it has been elevated to being a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly; and the criteria for membership will make it more difficult for states guilty of serious human rights violations to serve on the Council. This accords with the principal recommendations made by Amnesty International.</P>
        <P>The new council will be elected on 9 May 2006 and will begin its work on 19 June 2006. Ireland will now work to ensure that the important decisions to be taken during the initial stages of the council&rsquo;s operation will develop its capacity to play the fullest and most effective possible role.</P>
        <P>Apart from the Human Rights Council, the other major issue to which Amnesty International attaches great importance is the increase in funding for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. As one of the largest voluntary contributors to that office, Ireland was very pleased to see that a commitment to double the contribution to the Office of the High Commissioner from the regular UN budget was included in the summit outcome document.</P>
        <P>These revised funding arrangements, together with the new Human Rights Council, represent a valuable opportunity for progress on the human rights agenda.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In 2006, it is expected that the largest amounts of Irish development aid will be provided to Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Zambia. Ireland&rsquo;s assistance will be delivered via our embassies in these countries and through non-governmental organisations, NGOs, missionaries and UN agencies active on the ground. Funding will also be delivered through global programmes supported by Ireland, such as the global fund for AIDS, TB and malaria. It is estimated that in 2006 assistance amounting to over &euro;150 million will be provided to these five countries. These five countries are among the poorest in the world, ranked from number 146 to number 171, out of 177, on the United Nations human development index, HDI.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s support is focused on poverty reduction through the provision of basic services, the building of local capacity and the promotion of good governance, including human rights. We work closely with other donors, host governments and civil society to ensure a coherent and co-ordinated approach to development activities. This approach stands the best chance of reversing years of economic and social decline.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a very practical level our aid programme assists, <i>inter alia</i>, the building of schools, health centres, sanitation facilities and rural roads, the sinking of village wells and the training of teachers, health workers and public servants. We also focus on preventing and mitigating the spread of HIV-AIDS and we facilitate the promotion of a culture of good governance and human rights, through supporting human rights and anti-corruption commissions, as well as national parliaments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 84 and 116 together.</P>
        <P>There are three categories of specialists employed by Irish Aid &mdash; principal development specialists, senior development specialists and development specialists. All specialist positions will be transferring to Limerick. There are also three principal development specialists in Irish Aid headquarters in Dublin. None of the three has applied to decentralise to Limerick.</P>
        <P>There are 12 senior development specialists in Irish Aid headquarters. Likewise, from this group, none of the 12 has applied to decentralise to Limerick. Two senior development specialists originally applied to decentralise to Limerick but subsequently withdrew their applications. In addition, there are nine development specialist posts in headquarters. Five development specialists are intending to decentralise. Of these, four commenced employment since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003, and one applied via the central applications facility.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing with representatives of the specialists, their union IMPACT and the Department of Finance about the issues involved in decentralisation which also have a wider Civil Service dimension. It would be my hope that a greater number of specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 88 together.</P>
        <P>While the resolution establishing the Human Rights Council did not include all that Ireland and the EU had hoped for, I believe this body will represent an improvement on the Commission on Human Rights. The resolution was supported by 170 states, with only four states opposed and three abstaining. It was also <Col N="1221"/>endorsed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and prominent international human rights NGOs.</P>
        <P>With regard to the election of members of the council, the resolution establishing the body included a number of innovations. Whereas election to the former Commission on Human Rights was based on a simple majority of states present and voting in the General Assembly, states wishing to become members of the Human Rights Council will have to receive the support of an absolute majority of the General Assembly. In addition, states will be elected by secret ballot.</P>
        <P>Prospective members of the council also commit themselves to upholding the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, and will be the first to be scrutinised under the new universal periodic review mechanism which will examine the extent to which international human rights standards are respected on the domestic level.</P>
        <P>A mechanism has also been established to allow for the expulsion of a member of the council if it is deemed by a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly to be responsible for gross and systematic violations of human rights.</P>
        <P>In relation to Ireland&rsquo;s voting intentions, we have been approached by many countries seeking election to the Council. As the date for election is 9 May 2006, and states are still able to present their candidatures, a definitive decision has not been made as to which states Ireland will support. All candidates will be given due consideration but, clearly, Ireland will only support those countries that are firmly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights. In addition, Ireland and our European Union partners have undertaken not to vote for any state that is subject to Security Council sanctions for human rights related reasons.</P>
        <P>I am confident these factors will make the situation more conducive to producing a council whose members are genuinely committed to the promotion and protection of human rights.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 98 and 131 together.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement by ETA of a permanent ceasefire from 24 March 2006. This is a very positive development. Any move to a permanent ceasefire and the acceptance of purely democratic means is to be welcomed. The next steps in the process are for the Spanish Government and elected representatives to consider.</P>
        <P>ETA has been included on the EU list of terrorist organisations since December 2001. By a unanimous decision of EU member states, Batasuna was added to this list on 4 June 2003. In taking this decision, the Council was satisfied that Batasuna was a terrorist organisation and that it was an alias of ETA. The question of whether ETA and-or Batasuna will be removed from the EU&rsquo;s list of terrorist organisations is, in the first instance, for the Spanish Government to propose.</P>
        <P>While there are similarities between all conflict situations, each has its own specific characteristics and requirements. The peace process on the island of Ireland has followed our own roadmap and addressed issues particular to our own situation. It has been a long and challenging process and we are ready to share our experience if this would be helpful and if we are invited to do so by the Spanish Government. Indeed, the Taoiseach has already extended an invitation to Prime Minister Zapatero to visit Dublin.</P>
        <P>We in Ireland have a particular understanding of the value of peace, and I wish the Spanish people and Government every success in the process which is now beginning.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 91, 104, 105, 108, 291 and 292 together.</P>
        <P>The Government attaches the highest priority to the welfare of the undocumented Irish in the United States and takes every opportunity in contacts with US political leaders to emphasise the importance of addressing the matter in a constructive and sympathetic manner.</P>
        <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>As Deputies will be aware, the debate in the US on immigration reform has entered a critical phase. The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period provided the Government with a particularly timely opportunity to make known our views on this matter and, in particular, our strong support for the approach favoured by Senators Kennedy and McCain. It was an opportunity that we availed of to the full in our meetings with President Bush, his Administration and key figures on Capitol Hill.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>President Bush was appreciative of our position and he helpfully reiterated to us his support for a broad approach that involves reform as well as enforcement. This is an approach which he subsequently again underlined in speeches later in the month.</P><Col N="1224"/>
        <P>The Taoiseach and I also had a series of valuable meetings with Members of Congress including Senators Kennedy and McCain, as well as Senators Biden, Clinton, Dodd and Leahy and Congressman Jim Walsh and members of the Friends of Ireland Group. In each of these meetings we gave particular prominence to our views on the issue of the undocumented Irish and the need to address the situation.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Taoiseach and I had important discussions with Niall O&rsquo;Dowd and Grant Lally of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR. I commend the work of the ILIR which has had a significant impact on the debate in Washington and elsewhere in the US, and whose work I have been very pleased to support financially. We agreed to remain in close contact as the legislative process in Washington moves forward.</P>
        <P>Since our St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit, a significant and positive development has been the passage through the Senate Judiciary Committee of a comprehensive immigration reform bill which includes the core elements of the approach favoured by Senators Kennedy and McCain. This is a development which I have warmly welcomed. However, it remains clear that reaching consensus on this sensitive and divisive issue presents US legislators with a very formidable challenge. Consideration of this complex matter has now moved to the floor of the full Senate where it is currently being debated. I can assure the Deputies that the Government will continue to monitor the ongoing debate very closely and to actively convey to all sides our strong support for the regularisation of the status of the undocumented Irish in the US. In this regard, I also warmly welcome last week&rsquo;s visit to Washington of the Chairman and members of the Joint Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 290, 293 and 295 together.</P>
        <P>A coherent and co-ordinated approach is vital in addressing the immense needs of the vast continent of Africa, needs which have deepened through a complex combination of factors including food insecurity, poverty, climate change, poor economic growth, conflict, severe infrastructural deficits, poor governance, debt and the effects of HIV-AIDS. That coherent response, namely, the millennium development goals, MDGs, has been developed and refined by the United Nations, the key player in the co-ordination of the global community&rsquo;s response to poverty and suffering in the world today.</P>
        <P>The MDGs, fully supported by the leaders of the world and reaffirmed at the UN summit last September, represent the key development targets that must be reached if the challenge of poverty, hunger, disease and lack of development is to be met by 2015. There are eight goals in all, covering the eradication of poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, reducing child and maternal mortality, combating HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development. This is a comprehensive, ambitious but achievable set of goals. Ireland is fully committed to doing its part to ensure that they are attained.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid, the Government&rsquo;s official programme of overseas development assistance, has Africa at its core. Our approach to Africa has a number of different elements, each distinct but complementary. There is the humanitarian budget which responds to both complex and sudden-onset emergencies. Other elements are our recovery and long-term development programmes, which seek to assist countries emerging from natural and man-made emergencies and also address the fundamental causes of poverty in all its manifestations.</P>
        <P>The core of our aid programme in Africa concerns the building of strong partnerships with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa, namely, Ethi<Col N="1226"/>opia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. In addition, we work in many other African countries, either directly or through our partnerships with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, such as Christian Aid, Concern, GOAL, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and others. In the context of the increasing budget, as we approach the target of 0.7% by 2012, we are considering a further deepening of the engagement with Africa.</P>
        <P>As regards peace-keeping and conflict, Ireland is contributing to the security and stability of Liberia through its deployment of troops with UNMIL, the UN Mission in Liberia, since 2003. We are enhancing our engagement in Liberia on a range of key targets.</P>
        <P>Ireland works with and seeks to enhance the effectiveness of the multilateral framework provided by the EU, the UN and regional organisations in Africa, particularly the African Union, AU. Ireland is a strong advocate for the developing world and for international peace and security through our membership of the EU and the UN.</P>
        <P>The EU is the world&rsquo;s largest contributor of development co-operation. At the emergency humanitarian level, the EU strives to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and food insecure populations of Africa. In 2005, the European Commission&rsquo;s Humanitarian Office, ECHO, allocated over &euro;240 million in humanitarian assistance to Africa.</P>
        <P>We support capacity building both regionally and within African nations to respond to the humanitarian, conflict related and development challenges. Working through the African Union and its New Partnership for Africa&rsquo;s Development, NEPAD, programme, African Governments are showing a determination to address these issues collectively. The African Union represents an important strategic partner for the European Union and one with which ever closer relations are being forged in the interests of promoting peace, security, democracy and development on the African continent. Ireland has provided assistance to the African Union for its mission in Sudan, AMIS, as part of the EU&rsquo;s joint actions to foster peace and security in Darfur.</P>
        <P>The European Council in December 2005 adopted a long-term strategy for strengthening relations with Africa. The strategy, which is based on the principles of African ownership, equality and partnership, aims at promoting development, security and good governance in Africa and achieving the millennium development goals, as well as enhanced EU-Africa dialogue.</P>
        <P>We face huge challenges in working in Africa. However, a well-planned, co-ordinated and multifaceted global response combining the skills and resources of the international community of donors, EU, UN and AU partners is the only way to tackle those challenges and create a better future for all of the peoples of Africa.</P>

	<P>The next scheduled review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, will not take place until 2010. It will be preceded by a series of preparatory meetings beginning in 2007. Ireland will in the meantime continue to work with like-minded countries in identifying areas where implementation of the treaty can be strengthened.</P>
        <P>At the last NPT review in May 2005, there were a number of specific proposals on actions that states parties might take to meet the challenges confronting the treaty. Regrettably, the conference ended without agreement on substantive conclusions and recommendations on how to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.</P>
        <P>I have made clear, including in my address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, the Government&rsquo;s deep disappointment at this outcome. This was a missed opportunity for the international community to tackle some key threats to global peace and security and to agree an effective collective response. We are firmly of the view that the NPT is now more than ever of tremendous importance to the achievement of international peace and security. Action to strengthen the treaty, and ensure full respect for all its provisions, remains essential and we will spare no effort in pursuit of this objective.</P>
        <P>Ireland is committed to the full implementation of the NPT and believes that the 13 practical steps outlined in the outcome document of the 2000 NPT review conference set out a clear road by which the objective of nuclear disarmament can be reached.</P>
        <P>In Geneva earlier this month, the permanent representative of Ireland to the conference on disarmament reiterated the Irish position with regard to the NPT and emphasised the need for greater transparency on the part of the nuclear weapons states in their respective nuclear disarmament processes.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to a question on this matter on 22 February 2006.</P>
        <P>The Government, and its partners in the EU, remain very seriously concerned at Israeli activities in the occupied territories, including the building of settlements, house demolitions and continuing construction of the separation barrier on occupied land. These activities are contrary to international law, and to obligations under the Quartet roadmap. They threaten to undermine a solution based on the co-existence of two viable states, and likewise the possibility of a final status agreement on Jerusalem. It remains the clear position of the EU that it will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Middle East peace process is discussed at every meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. The meetings which I attended on 7 and 21 November 2005 expressed particular concern about the implementation of Israeli policies in and around east Jerusalem, and repeated the EU position on changes to the pre-1967 borders. The EU&rsquo;s concerns were reaffirmed in the Declaration on the Middle East which was adopted by the European Council on 15 December 2005.</P>
        <P>At its meeting on 21 November, the Council had agreed that a detailed EU analysis on east Jerusalem should be prepared for adoption and publication by the Council on 12 December 2005. The matter was discussed in detail at the meeting on 12 December, but consensus was not reached on the publication of an analysis, primarily because of the domestic political developments in Israel in the intervening period. There has been no change, however, in the EU position on these important issues. The Government will continue to raise its concerns directly in discussions with the new Israeli Government. We, and our partners in the EU, will continue to engage constructively with the Israeli Government and with the Palestinian Authority to encourage them to fulfil their obligations under the roadmap, and under international law.</P>

        <P>As recommended by Ambassador Eide, a process of consideration of the future status of Kosovo, led by the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Envoy, former Finnish President Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, has been under way since late last year. Ireland and our EU partners fully support the work of Mr. Ahtisaari and his team, and look forward to working with all those involved to ensure the development of a truly multi-ethnic society in Kosovo in the future. The EU has also nominated a representative to the Kosovo future status process, Mr. Stefan Lehne, who is working closely with Mr. Ahtisaari. Ireland, together with our EU partners, continues to have ongoing contacts with those involved in these important negotiations.</P>
        <P>Talks between Serbia, including representatives of the Kosovo Serb community, and the Kosovo Albanians began in February in Vienna under the auspices of Mr. Ahtisaari. So far the atmosphere appears to have been reasonably constructive, although there remain considerable differences in the position of the delegations on the fundamental issues. The Kosovo Albanians are seeking independence while Serbia wants &ldquo;less than independence and more than autonomy&rdquo; for Kosovo. In addition to the direct negotiations, Mr. Ahtisaari has been holding an ongoing series of consultations with all parties involved in the conflict and the members of the contact group, which includes the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia and the EU. It is expected that the status process will continue over the coming months with a view to achieving agreement, if possible, by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The Irish Embassy in Budapest is accredited to Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo. Ireland also currently contributes 211 Defence Force personnel to KFOR, the UN mandated peacekeeping force in Kosovo.</P>

	<P>The Government continues to encourage all sections of the community and all political parties to give their support to the new policing arrangements in Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach and I have repeatedly reiterated that there should be no further delay by Sinn F&eacute;in in endorsing these <Col N="1230"/>new arrangements including by joining the Policing Board and participating fully in the work of the district policing partnerships. It has been widely acknowledged, including by the independent Oversight Commissioner, that the PSNI has undergone a wide-ranging transformation in recent years, and is now one of the most accountable policing services worldwide. It merits the active support of all sections of the community.</P>
        <P>The Government has also made clear that support for policing remains a critical element in putting in place a new political dispensation for Northern Ireland. There is no doubt that a positive decision by Sinn F&eacute;in on the policing issue could greatly facilitate the political process. The Government will continue to press for progress in this area in the crucial period ahead.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 122 and 289 together.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise that Afghanistan&rsquo;s transition to democracy and representative government over the past four years is a considerable achievement. Afghanistan now has a democratic constitution, a representative national Parliament and a legitimate elected Government. Efforts are ongoing to consolidate the progress that has been made and reforms are currently under way across all sectors to provide security and essential public services to the Afghan population.</P>
        <P>Progress continues to be made in institution-building. Parliamentary committees have been formed and have begun their important oversight work. On 22 March, President Karzai nominated a new cabinet and the Parliament will vote shortly to confirm the ministerial appointments. Parliamentary approval will also be required to confirm President Karzai&rsquo;s nominations to the new Supreme Court.</P><Col N="1231"/>
        <P>The security situation, however, remains a cause of serious concern and continues to undermine reconstruction efforts outside the cities. The conflict is complex and is influenced not just by Taliban insurgency but also by a number of other factors including ethnic and tribal tensions, narcotics and crime.</P>
        <P>The International Conference on Afghanistan, held in London on 31 January-1 February marked a new stage in Afghanistan&rsquo;s development. The Afghanistan compact, launched at the conference, will guide the joint efforts of the Afghan Government and the international community in meeting outstanding challenges across three pillars of activity: security; governance, rule of law and human rights, and economic and social development. Counter-narcotics has been identified as a cross-cutting priority. The compact notes that Afghanistan&rsquo;s transition to peace and stability is not yet assured and that strong international engagement will be required to address remaining challenges. In the spirit of that engagement, over &euro;8 billion was pledged to Afghanistan by the international community at the conference.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that Ireland was in a position to announce a &euro;5 million pledge at the launch of the compact. This latest pledge reflects Ireland&rsquo;s continuing commitment to supporting the reconstruction and reform process in Afghanistan. Funding will be expended over the next two years through the World Bank-administered Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund, ARTF, in support of the Afghan national development strategy and the achievement of Afghanistan&rsquo;s millennium development goals. We will also continue to support the efforts of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations towards pro-poor sustainable development in Afghanistan.</P>
        <P>Ireland donated &euro;17 million at previous pledging conferences in Tokyo and Berlin in 2002 and 2004 respectively. Funding was expended via the ARTF and through a range of Irish and international non-governmental organisations, including Tr&oacute;caire, Concern, GOAL, Christian Aid, Halo Trust and Handicap International. Ireland also supported the electoral process through the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, election support programme, which steered the successful presidential election in 2004 and National Assembly and Provincial Council Elections in 2005.</P>

	<P>The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro formally succeeded the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 4 February 2003. The Constitutional Charter of the State Union provided for referendums on independence to be held in either or both of the republics, subject to a three year moratorium. The Montenegrin Government has declared its intention to hold a referendum on Montenegrin independence and this is now scheduled to take place on 21 May next.</P>
        <P>Following discussions at EU level, the Union has sought to ensure that the referendum will be carried out in line with accepted international standards. In December 2005 the Secretary General-High Representative for CFSP, Javier Solana, appointed Ambassador Miroslav Lajcak of Slovakia as his personal representative to facilitate negotiations between the Montenegrin Government and opposition on modalities for the proposed referendum. At the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, meeting on 27 February last, Ministers reviewed developments.</P>
        <P>Negotiations between the Government and opposition, facilitated by Ambassador Lajcak, have resulted in a comprehensive referendum law which was passed by the Montenegrin Parliament on 1 March last. We welcome the agreement reached between the Government and opposition on the referendum issue. Together with our EU colleagues we support the right of the people of Montenegro to hold a referendum on independence as provided for in the Constitutional Charter of the State Union. The result of the referendum obviously will be decided by the voters and we will support the outcome.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 85, 129 and 278 together.</P>
        <P>In October of last year, following a series of public consultation meetings around the country in advance of the publication of Ireland&rsquo;s first ever White Paper on Development Policy, I decided, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that we should change the name of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance programme from Development Co-operation Ireland to something clearer and more direct.</P>
        <P>It was evident from the meetings around the country that awareness of the Government&rsquo;s official aid programme was low and that the name Development Co-operation Ireland, despite being an accurate description of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, had gained little recognition among the general public. Following internal discussions in my Department, the name &ldquo;Irish Aid&rdquo; was chosen and announced on 27 February.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid is simple and straightforward; it explains what we do and is much easier to understand. Irish taxpayers will this year contribute over &euro;730 million to helping some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, and they have a right to know how this is spent and to feel proud at what is being achieved on their behalf. The name change has been made in the context of increased efforts to make the work of the Government&rsquo;s aid programme better known and understood within Ireland.</P>
        <P>The total cost of the name change is &euro;12,712. This includes the design of the new logo, new stationary design and signage. The cost of the name change in 2003 was &euro;2,807.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the call by the United Nations that unless sufficient funds are made available upwards of 300,000 children may die in west Africa in 2006 in nations bordering the Sahara desert; the amount which Ireland has pledged to this effort; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The humanitarian situation in the Sahel region of west Africa remains a matter of deepest concern to me. In <Col N="1234"/>2005, the deepening food crisis in Niger and surrounding countries highlighted a weakness in the international response system. The urgency of the situation took too long to come to light and the response was delayed as a result. At the time, Ireland responded in a prompt and timely manner with support of &euro;3 million to Niger and Burkina Faso as the most seriously affected countries. Thankfully, the situation was quickly alleviated and a good harvest eased immediate needs.</P>
        <P>The situation in Niger helped make the case for an enhanced international capacity to respond to such crises. The creation of the United Nation&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF, will now enable the UN and NGOs to access grant-based, stand-by funding and thereby speed their response to rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situations. Ireland has contributed &euro;10 million to the operation of the CERF, which I believe represents a vital contribution to strengthening the international capacity to response to humanitarian crises.</P>
        <P>Despite the 2005 harvest, many people across the Sahel region remain vulnerable in 2006. Accumulated debts, lack of social supports, persistent chronic malnutrition and high market prices for maize remain serious obstacles to recovery. Recognising this ongoing vulnerability, Ireland responded before this latest UN appeal was launched. In February, I allocated funding of &euro;500,000 to the UN world food programme for its ongoing work in Niger to assist those most vulnerable to food shortages. In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s funding partnership with the International Federation of the Red Cross, IFRC, which I have recently approved, will provide &euro;1.5 million in 2006 and 2007 to assist the national Red Cross societies in this region to build local capacity to respond to such emergencies as they may arise in the future.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that this region remains a priority for Ireland and that our focus remains on ensuring that the vulnerable populations receive the humanitarian assistance they require in a timely and effective manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three investigations currently under way into allegations regarding the existence of secret detention centres. The first is an investigation by Senator Dick Marty, a rapporteur appointed by the Committee on Legal Affairs <Col N="1235"/>and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The Department of Foreign Affairs has not been contacted by Senator Marty. However, in his most recent information memorandum to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, the Senator accurately records the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;total condemnation&rdquo; of the practice of extraordinary rendition.</P>
        <P>The second investigation takes the form of a questionnaire sent to all member states of the Council of Europe by the Secretary General, Mr. Terry Davis, relating to allegations regarding secret prisons and so-called extraordinary rendition. As I informed the House on 21 February 2006, the Government has co-operated fully with the Secretary General&rsquo;s request and replied in advance of the deadline. The response confirms my previous statements to the House recording the Government&rsquo;s very deep concern over allegations of the possible existence of secret prisons, and its complete opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition.</P>
        <P>Our response was one of only nine out of 46 deemed by the Secretary General to be sufficiently comprehensive not to have required any further clarification.</P>
        <P>The third investigation is being carried out by a temporary committee established by the European Parliament &ldquo;to find out whether the CIA carried out torture or illegal detentions on EU territory, and whether citizens from Member States or candidate countries have been detained&rdquo;.  Meetings with a wide range of relevant individuals and organisations are taking place with a view to producing an interim report by the beginning of June.</P>

	<P>Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union provides that any European state that respects the principles on which the EU is founded may apply to become a member. The treaty sets no numerical limit to the membership of the Union. It is true, however, that the existing institutional arrangements were created for a considerably smaller Union than the one that exists today.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s view is that the provisions of the EU constitution would serve to create a more efficient and effective Union. In particular, ratification and implementation of the EU constitution would help consolidate the success of the most recent enlargement and strengthen the institutional capacity of the Union. This will be a critical factor in determining the Union&rsquo;s ability to <Col N="1236"/>take in new members in the future. In its 2005 enlargement strategy paper, the Commission noted that a well-functioning Union is in the interests of both present and future members.</P>
        <P>In December last, EU Foreign Ministers agreed that careful attention needs to be paid to the important issue of the Union&rsquo;s absorption capacity in the context of any further enlargement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 99 and 274 together.</P>
        <P>The period of reflection on the European constitution, which was initiated following the &ldquo;No&rdquo; votes in France and the Netherlands, is due for review at the June European Council. Foreign Ministers will prepare this review over the coming months and Ireland will be contributing actively to this work.</P>
        <P>Most member states remain firmly committed to the EU constitution, which a majority have already ratified. The Government wants to see the constitution brought into force as soon as circumstances permit. We do not favour either its selective implementation or a renegotiation of the text. Agreement on the European constitution was arrived at following a long and complex set of negotiations. It is highly unlikely that another negotiation would produce a meaningfully different result which would be acceptable to all member states.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the referendum results in France and the Netherlands have greatly com<Col N="1237"/>plicated the ratification process and more time is required to sort out the issues raised by these developments. This is the purpose behind the current period of reflection on the constitution and the future of Europe, but it is still too early to draw conclusions on these issues. This means that there is at present little or no scope for pressing ahead with the ratification of the constitution. It is to be hoped that 2007 will bring new opportunities for progress towards the constitution&rsquo;s entry into force.</P>

	<P>Emergency humanitarian aid of &euro;60 million has been allocated within the overseas development assistance budget for 2006. This funding is allocated on the basis of humanitarian need to save lives wherever they are threatened. The funding is not therefore pre-allocated to any region of the world. Funding is released in line with the principles of best humanitarian practice which are neutrality, humanity, independence and impartiality.</P>
        <P>In line with the good humanitarian donorship, GHD, initiative, in which Ireland plays an active role, humanitarian funding support should be released at an early point in the year to enable UN agencies, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and the International Red Cross movement to respond in a prompt and timely manner to humanitarian needs in these countries.</P>
        <P>To date in 2006, &euro;38 million in humanitarian funding has been released to address human suffering and need in 15 countries. A total of &euro;19 million of this was provided to the United Nations consolidated appeals process, CAP, which addresses humanitarian needs across some 20 ongoing situations, mainly in Africa. Most of the remainder was delivered through key NGO partners and humanitarian agencies such as the Red Cross family.</P>
        <P>In addition, Ireland also provides assistance in response to sudden onset humanitarian emergencies such as earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters. In 2005, humanitarian assistance was provided in response to emergency humanitarian situations in some 28 countries.</P><Col N="1238"/>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to assist and address humanitarian situations across the world on the basis of assessed needs and through the provision of assistance to key NGOs, UN agencies and international humanitarian organisations on the basis of the principles set out above.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 106 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland has raised the issue of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay with the US authorities on numerous occasions. Most recently, the Taoiseach raised concerns regarding Guantanamo Bay at his meeting with President Bush in Washington on 17 March 2006, which I also attended. President Bush said that he fully understood the Taoiseach&rsquo;s concerns and that he would also like to close the detention facility when possible. President Bush also noted that the US Administration was awaiting a ruling by the US Supreme Court on the use of army tribunals to try detainees in Guantanamo. I understand that the case referred to was Hamdan <i>v.</i> Rumsfeld, which came before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, 28 March 2006 and which challenges the legality of the 2001 military order establishing military commissions to try terrorist suspects. The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision is expected in July 2006.</P>
        <P>Ireland holds the view that those detained in Guantanamo must be treated in accordance with the requirements of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. This <Col N="1239"/>position is shared by the EU. I have made it clear that I endorse the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s view that those held in Guantanamo Bay should either be charged or released, and that the US should close this facility.</P>
        <P>While we continue to press for the closure of the Guantanamo facility and for respect for the principles of international law, the legality of the 2001 military order under US law is a matter for the US courts to determine.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 124 together.</P>
        <P>Accession negotiations were opened with both Croatia and Turkey on 3 October 2005. According to the negotiating frameworks agreed with both countries, the shared objective of the negotiations &mdash; an open-ended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand &mdash; is accession. Both countries will be expected to maintain their commitment to the full implementation of human rights and other reforms and the EU will remain firm in demanding that aspiring members fulfil all the requirements of membership. The Union&rsquo;s capacity to absorb new members will be an important consideration. A well-functioning Union is in the interests of both present and future members.</P>
        <P>Both countries will be judged on their own merits and the pace of the negotiations will be determined by progress in fulfilling the requirements of membership. However, as Turkey&rsquo;s accession could have substantial financial consequences, its negotiations can only be concluded after the establishment of the Union&rsquo;s financial framework for the period from 2014.</P>
        <P>An extensive screening process is currently under way in which experts from the Commission explain EU rules to the two countries and examine their strategies for adopting and implementing them. It is expected to take until autumn 2006 to complete the screening process for the required 33 chapters. After each chapter has been screened the EU can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether the negotiations in that sector can be opened.</P>
        <P>In late November 2005 the Commission presented its first screening reports to the Enlargement Working Group on the science and <Col N="1240"/>research and education and culture chapters. Member states have agreed that both countries should be invited to present to the Presidency their negotiating positions for the science and research chapter. Discussions are continuing within the EU on the education and culture chapter.</P>
        <P>On 12 December 2005, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, welcomed agreement with Croatia and Turkey on the accession partnerships, which are designed to provide support in overcoming problems related to accession. Both Croatia and Turkey benefit from the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; bilateral assistance programme, which provides support for new member states, acceding and candidate countries in coping with the considerable challenges of EU membership.</P>

	<P>On 23 March 2006, the General Affairs and External Relations Council approved the crisis management concept for an EU military crisis management mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC. The Council&rsquo;s decision follows a request from the United Nations that an EU force be deployed to support MONUC, the UN mission in the DRC, during the period of elections in that country.</P>
        <P>While detailed planning for the mission is ongoing, it is likely that the total number of personnel taking part will be in the region of 1,500. Germany will provide the operational headquarters for the mission, based in Potsdam, with France providing the force headquarters in Kinshasa. Together, Germany and France will provide approximately two thirds of the force.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has consistently supported a positive response from the EU to the UN as part of our overall commitment to closer EU-UN co-operation in the area of conflict resolution in Africa. As my colleague, the Minister for Defence, has already told the House, Ireland has already written to the chairman of the EU military staff confirming our willingness to offer up to ten headquarters personnel for the mission subject to our national decision making procedures. The United Nations Security Council is likely to adopt a resolution authorising the mission within the next few weeks, after which a final decision will be taken by the Government on the exact composition of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution. Our proposed contribution is in line with that of other contributing member states and should be looked at in the context of our existing major commitments to peacekeeping operations in Africa and in the Balkans.</P>

	<P>Ireland is strongly supportive of international standards and norms to combat all forms of slavery, including child labour. During our Presidency of the European Union, Ireland made a statement on behalf of the EU at the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of slavery, which strongly condemned child labour. Ireland and the EU have also raised this important issue at meetings of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>The Government supports the work of the International Labour Organisation, which is the main United Nations agency dealing with the issue of bonded labour. The ILO seeks to improve working and living conditions through the adoption of international labour conventions and recommendations setting minimum standards in such fields as wages, hours of work and conditions of employment. It is a unique agency in the UN system, given its tripartite structure comprising representatives of governments, employer groups and worker groups. The ILO&rsquo;s work on bonded labour and child-bonded labour takes place in its framework of international labour standards, which are international legal instruments. The ILO has played a critical role in highlighting the plight of more than 246 million children in child labour and has sought to tackle this issue through its international programme on the elimination of child labour. Ireland was elected as a deputy member of the ILO governing body for a three-year term in June 2005.</P>
        <P>The Government, through Irish Aid, supports the ILO special action programme to combat forced labour. Government funding for this programme from 2003 to 2006 will amount to &euro;1.6 million. The programme tackles issues of bonded labour in Asia, forced labour and human trafficking in Europe and forced labour among indigenous peoples in Latin America. The programme has had considerable impact worldwide in galvanising international action on forced labour. Ireland also supports civil society efforts to end child labour. Tr&oacute;caire is a key partner in the Government&rsquo;s aid programme. In this regard, <Col N="1242"/>Irish Aid has given substantial support to Tr&oacute;caire in 2003-2005 under the first phase of the multi-annual programme scheme, under which predictable Irish Aid financial support is provided to key non-governmental organisation partners for an agreed programme of development activity. This assistance amounted to more than &euro;34 million, including support for efforts to combat child labour.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 22 February 2006 on the matter of avian influenza.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Avian flu has not recently been on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council but will be addressed as the situation requires. It is discussed regularly at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, which has primary responsibility in this regard and which met most recently on 20 March. The issue is receiving constant attention at official level at meetings of the chief veterinary officers and at the standing committee on the food chain and animal health. The chief veterinary officers are meeting in Brussels this week and the standing committee discussed the issue on 23 and 24 March. The H5N1 virus has been confirmed in 11 member states of the EU to date. In all but two of the member states concerned, it remains confined to the wild bird population. In France, however, an outbreak in poultry has been confirmed and in Sweden an outbreak has been confirmed on a game farm.</P>
        <P>In view of the role played by wild birds in spreading the virus, the focus of the Department of Agriculture and Food is on early detection, minimising the risk of any subsequent transmission to the commercial poultry flock and, in the event of such a transmission, the rapid removal of the infected flock and the efficient management of any outbreak. The Commission has moved swiftly to apply safeguard measures to all affected countries. It has also adopted a number of decisions, three of which have been transposed into Irish law within the past month. These deal with precautionary measures and steps that will be put in place in response to an outbreak. The Minister for Agriculture and Food is continuing to review and refine our own contingency arrangements. In response to the increased risk, the Minister has established an avian flu <Col N="1243"/>expert advisory group to advise on various control measures that may be put in place. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has regularly briefed the Government on developments. The Government task force on emergency planning, chaired by the Minister for Defence and on which my Department is represented, has been briefed regularly on the situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last month, the Minister met her French counterpart in Dublin and took the opportunity to review the current situation regarding avian influenza in Europe. This meeting was particularly opportune in light of the recent outbreak in France. The T&aacute;naiste attended an informal ministerial meeting on the health aspects of avian influenza which took place in Vienna on 24 February 2006. Health Ministers agreed on the need for rapid co-ordinated action within the European Union to combat the avian influenza virus. They emphasised that while infection of humans by the H5N1 virus since its appearance in Asia has been minimal, this virus is a source of continuing concern which demands ongoing vigilance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is conscious of the cross-Border dimension of this issue, which I discussed with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Hain, at our recent meeting. Officials from the relevant Departments, North and South, are in regular contact on a wide range of avian influenza related issues. These contacts are being maintained at both formal and informal levels. This is a good example of the type of practical North-South co-operation that makes sense for everyone on the island.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s total bilateral aid to Ethiopia in 2005 amounted to &euro;35 million. It is expected that the total funding to Ethiopia in 2006 will be at approximately the same level. Ireland&rsquo;s support to Ethiopia is focused on addressing the basic needs of the rural poor. Ireland does not provide general or direct budget support to the federal Government of Ethiopia. Of the total budget for 2005, &euro;5.3 million was delivered to sectoral programmes in the areas of health, education and transport. Working with the relevant ministries, Ireland earmarked support for the training of health workers and teachers and the improvement of rural roads.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland also assisted two regional authorities, namely, Tigray in northern Ethiopia and the SNNPR, or southern nations nationalities and people's region, in the south. In Tigray, Ireland expended &euro;6 million to assist the authorities to <Col N="1244"/>provide a full range of services to the people of this very poor region. In the southern nations region, Ireland provided support of &euro;4.3 million to the regional authorities&rsquo; programmes in education, health and HIV/AIDS.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A key component of Ireland&rsquo;s programme in Ethiopia is our support to the UN monitored social safety nets fund, which provides seven million of the poorest Ethiopians with cash or food in exchange for labour. This innovative fund, which was established with assistance and expertise from Ireland, is perceived as an invaluable instrument in preventing up to seven million people from facing starvation each year. In 2005, Irish non-governmental organisations working in Ethiopia received financial support of &euro;5 million. These included Concern, GOAL, Self Help Development International and Tr&oacute;caire. An additional &euro;2 million was shared with more than 30 Ethiopian based non-governmental organisations to mitigate the effects of the HIV-AIDS pandemic. Ireland spent &euro;4.5 million on initiatives promoting better governance in Ethiopia. Activities supported included promoting the voice of poor communities and facilitating government institutions to be more responsive to people&rsquo;s needs, including assistance for the Human Rights Commission and civic education. In 2006, the aid programme in Ethiopia will continue to focus on the rural poor with the emphasis on the areas of health, education, good governance, HIV-AIDS and the safety nets programme.</P>

	<P>In the Government&rsquo;s contacts with the US authorities, on which I have reported to the House in considerable detail as recently as 22 February 2006, we have been concerned to ensure that no extraordinary rendition of prisoners has occurred or is occurring through Ireland. The Taoiseach raised the matter with President Bush in Washington DC on 17 March 2006. The assurances that we have received from the US authorities in this matter have been categorical and unambiguous. In this regard, prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.</P>
        <P>As regards the question of whether planes allegedly used for extraordinary rendition elsewhere might land at Shannon, our view on the matter is best expressed through our complete <Col N="1245"/>opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition, irrespective of where it may occur, which has been made clear on numerous occasions.</P>

        <P>I travelled to the United States from 11 to 17 March to represent the Government at promotional events in Dallas before attending the customary St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day ceremonies in Washington.</P>
        <P>On 17 March, I accompanied the Taoiseach to the White House for the traditional presentation of shamrock, followed by a meeting with President Bush in the Oval Office. Our discussions with the President covered Northern Ireland, immigration reform and other issues including international issues. The Taoiseach and I also had a series of valuable meetings with key members of Congress including Senators Biden, Clinton, Dodd, Kennedy, Leahy and McCain. We also met with Congressman Jim Walsh and members of the Friends of Ireland group in Congress. The focus of these meetings was on Northern Ireland and immigration reform. This special opportunity, unique to Ireland, for direct and detailed dialogue with the President of the United States and his Administration and also key players on Capitol Hill is exceptionally valued by the Government.</P>
        <P>My programme also included attendance at the American-Ireland Fund national gala dinner, the lunch hosted by Speaker Hastert, and the ambassador&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day reception. In addition, the Taoiseach and I had a very valuable meeting on immigration reform with Niall O&rsquo;Dowd and Grant Lally of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform. I accompanied the Taoiseach to a meeting with the Ireland-America economic advisory board. Discussions with the board focused on the successes of the Irish economy, business prospects in the US and developments in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Dallas, my programme included attendance at the Irish-American Society dinner, the downtown parade and a breakfast hosted by the American-Ireland Fund. I also had a briefing session with the editorial board of the <i>Dallas <Col N="1246"/>Morning News</i> and addressed a lunch hosted by the Dallas Chamber of Commerce. My address to the business lunch focused on the success of the Irish economy, highlighting the theme of the Irish advantage, which was also articulated by the Taoiseach and Ministers at a wide variety of events throughout the world over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period. The importance of the Irish-American relationship, the peace process and immigration reform also featured in my remarks and discussions in Dallas.</P>

        <Quest>his views on whether Ireland&rsquo;s proposed participation in the EU battle groups will require Ireland&rsquo;s triple lock requirement to be compromised; the way in which the requirement for rapid deployment of battle groups can be reconciled with Ireland&rsquo;s need for a UN mandate before Irish troops are sent abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Taoiseach, the Minister for Defence and I have stated on many occasions, the Government remains committed to the triple lock requirements of UN authorisation, Government decision and D&aacute;il approval before the deployment of Irish troops abroad. Any participation in peace support operations, whether carried out directly by the UN or, for example, as part of an EU-led mission with UN authorisation, is for sovereign national decision. This would apply to operations carried out as part of an EU battle group in the same way as it does to any other peace support operation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The importance of battle groups as a valuable contribution to the efforts of the United Nations in crisis management has been emphasised by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and has been endorsed in the outcome document of the world summit last September. EU battle groups have a key role to play in support of UN peacekeeping, specifically by having the ability to deploy very rapidly to crisis situations. The fact that EU battle groups would be expected to be on the ground in a short period is in no way incompatible with authorisation from the UN Security Council. The Security Council, as part of its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, has often shown the ability to act very quickly when required.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not alone in the European Union in looking for UN authorisation before deploying its defence forces on peace support operations overseas. Many member states acknowledge that they <Col N="1247"/>would normally have a <i>de facto</i> political requirement for the legitimacy which a resolution of the UN Security Council conveys on peace support operations, particularly robust Chapter VII-type missions for which battle groups are particularly relevant. All member states need to complete their respective national decision-making procedures before deploying troops overseas, most of which would include parliamentary approval processes. The decision by any member state to participate in an EU battle group, or indeed in the European security and defence policy as a whole, does not imply automatic participation by that member state in a specific peace support operation. This is a fundamental principle of the European security and defence policy.</P>
        <P>It is possible that there may be cases in which the Government and this House might wish Ireland to participate in a peacekeeping mission, whether as part of an EU battle group or otherwise, but where no UN authorisation was forthcoming, including as a result of a permanent member of the UN Security Council exercising its veto. In such a scenario, Irish troops would be unable to participate in that mission. This is a fundamental element of the triple lock and one to which this Government remains committed. We have consistently made this clear to EU partners, including to Sweden, with whom we are discussing possible participation in the Nordic battle group. The potential for countries which are contributing to battle groups being unable to deploy for various reasons is well recognised within the EU and it is expected that battle groups will need a level of built in redundancy to cover such scenarios.</P>

	<P>Ireland and our partners in the European Union take a close interest in the situation in Sri Lanka. The European Union, in a statement on 27 January, welcomed the agreement by the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to hold talks in Geneva on 22 and 23 February. It expressed its firm hope that the talks would help stabilise the situation in Sri <Col N="1248"/>Lanka and lead to a peaceful solution of the conflict. It also reiterated its full support for Norway&rsquo;s role as facilitator of the peace process.</P>
        <P>Following the Geneva talks, which were held as planned, the co-chairs of the Tokyo donor conference, the European Union, Japan, Norway and the United States, welcomed the renewed commitment from the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to respect and uphold the ceasefire agreement. The co-chairs further welcomed the parties&rsquo; commitment to ensure that there would be no violence, killings and operations by armed groups, in accordance with the ceasefire agreement. The co-chairs stressed the importance of the parties implementing these commitments on the ground so as to build confidence and an environment conducive to progressing towards lasting peace for all the peoples of Sri Lanka. The co-chairs said that they stood ready to assist Norway in its efforts to bring about a durable peace in Sri Lanka.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Union will continue to do its utmost to help the parties along the road of negotiation. I am pleased that the level of violence has reduced since the meeting in February and I hope that the next round of talks between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE, in Geneva on 19 to 21 April, will lead to renewed efforts by all sides to work towards a lasting peace. Since the December 2004 tsunami disaster, Ireland has supported the activities of seven non-governmental organisations engaged in relief and recovery work in Sri Lanka as well as various UN agencies, the International Organisation for Migrants and the International Committee of the Red Cross. To date, in excess of &euro;4.7 million has been allocated by Ireland to relief and recovery activities in Sri Lanka.</P>

	<P>I have not had recent discussions with either India or Pakistan but both countries are well aware of Ireland&rsquo;s long-held position that both should join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as non-nuclear weapon states. As I made clear in my replies to Questions Nos. 64 and 153 of 22 February 2006, Ireland has a long-standing policy of support for the NPT, going back to Frank Aiken&rsquo;s initiative almost 50 years ago, and attaches the utmost importance to its universalisation. India, Pakistan and Israel are the only three countries that have not acceded to the NPT. Ireland will continue to avail of every opportunity to call for their adherence to the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states at national <Col N="1249"/>level, within the EU, within the new agenda coalition and at the United Nations.</P>
        <P>Ireland strongly supports United Nations Security Council Resolution 1172 adopted in June 1998 which, <i>inter alia</i>, calls on India and Pakistan to become parties to the NPT and to the comprehensive test ban treaty and to stop immediately their nuclear weapons development programmes, including the development of ballistic missiles capable of nuclear weapons delivery. At the NPT review conference in New York last May, I stated that it was a matter of serious concern that India, Israel and Pakistan continue to remain outside the NPT regime and I urged them to accede to the treaty unconditionally and at an early date. Such a call has also been made in recent statements by the European Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland, with our partners in the new agenda coalition, introduced a resolution on the NPT to the first committee of the United Nations General Assembly last October. A paragraph in the resolution that urged India, Israel and Pakistan to accede to the treaty was supported by 148 countries. Last December, when the issue was taken up in the plenary of the General Assembly, 158 UN member states endorsed this call. Pakistan voted against that paragraph of the resolution at the first committee but abstained during the plenary while India and Israel voted against the resolution on both occasions. We will continue to press for the universalisation of the NPT and for India, Pakistan and Israel to accede unconditionally to the treaty.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 127 and 128 together.</P>
        <P>I have not had any recent direct contact with representatives of the Iranian Government in respect of Iran&rsquo;s compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The last occasion that I had an opportunity to discuss this matter with the Iranian Government was when I met the then Foreign Minister, Dr. Kamal Kharrazi, on 2 May 2005, during the NPT review conference in New <Col N="1250"/>York. During that meeting, I underlined my belief that difficulties should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation and that if a solution was found on the nuclear issue, this would open the way to making progress on other aspects of relations with Iran.</P>
        <P>My most recent discussions with my EU counterparts on the Iranian nuclear programme was at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 20 March 2006. The Council emphasised that the EU continues to be committed to a diplomatic solution, deeply regretted that Iran has failed to implement in full the measures deemed necessary by the IAEA board, resulting in the involvement of the UN Security Council. The council also expressed its deep concern at Iran&rsquo;s continuing failure to co-operate fully with the IAEA and to take the steps necessary to re-establish international confidence in the peaceful purpose of its nuclear programme. It indicated that it believed that the Security Council should act to reinforce the authority of the IAEA and called upon Iran urgently to meet in full the requests set out in the IAEA board of governors&rsquo; resolution of 4 February, including a full suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities.</P>
        <P>I welcome the UN Security Council presidential statement adopted on 29 March 2006 on the Iranian nuclear programme. The statement notes with serious concern Iran&rsquo;s decision to resume enrichment related activities and to suspend co-operation with the IAEA under the additional protocol. The statement calls on Iran to comply with the steps required in the IAEA board of governors&rsquo; resolution of 4 February 2006 and underlined the particular importance of re-establishing full and sustained suspension of all enrichment related and reprocessing activities including research and development. The IAEA director general is requested to provide a report to the board of governors, and in parallel to the Security Council, within 30 days on Iranian compliance with the steps required by the IAEA board of governors.</P>
        <P>We urge Iran to suspend immediately all enrichment related activities, to co-operate fully with the IAEA and to provide the necessary transparency and openness to resolve all outstanding issues in its nuclear programme. The resolution of those issues would help to restore the confidence of the international community in Iran&rsquo;s declared wish to have a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes.</P>

	<P>My Department has been closely monitoring the situation in Nepal. Regrettably, the political crisis there seems to be intensifying. While we have not had any recent direct bilateral contacts with the Nepalese Government, we have been active within the EU framework and have contributed to discussions in relevant working groups.</P>
        <P>On 27 January, the EU issued a declaration which called upon the King, the Government of Nepal and the security forces to restore immediately all civil and political liberties, immediately release all political prisoners and human rights defenders, and ensure that political and civil rights, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech could be exercised peacefully. It strongly condemned the use of force to suppress the Nepalese people&rsquo;s exercise of fundamental rights, while also strongly condemning the resumption of Maoist violence. It also reiterated that what Nepal and its people urgently needed was a cessation of armed hostilities as a first step in an inclusive and comprehensive peace process.</P>
        <P>We have been concerned by the large number of arrests in Nepal in recent months, including that in January of Krishna Pahadi who attended the Front Line Platform late last year which I had the pleasure of addressing. We ensured that our concern at this and other arrests was included in an EU <i>d&eacute;marche</i> to the Nepalese authorities which took place on 1 February. In the course of the <i>d&eacute;marche</i>, the EU side made special reference to detained political leaders and human rights defenders, calling for their immediate release. We have also proposed that the EU might look at providing further support for the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Kathmandu. In 2005, Ireland made a voluntary contribution of &euro;200,000 to this office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 16 February, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, met in Dublin with Dr. Arju n Karki, President of the NGO Federation of Nepal and co-ordinator of the South Asian Alliance for Poverty Eradication, who provided a first-hand account of the situation on the ground in Nepal. Dr. Karki was assured that Ireland was closely following developments in Nepal.</P>
        <P>A further EU discussion on the situation in Nepal is due to take place tomorrow when the most recent political developments and their implications for EU policy will be examined. Together with our EU partners, we will continue to closely monitor the situation in Nepal and will urge all sides to pursue a peaceful, political solution and to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>

	<P>As I outlined in my reply of 21 February 2006 to a parliamentary question on this general issue, consular assistance is provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs in a wide variety of circumstances, with each situation being assessed case by case having regard to all the factors involved. The Department, for instance, is prepared to advance funds to assist Irish citizens where this is judged to be required to ensure their security and safety and where the individuals concerned cannot gain immediate access to the necessary funds.</P>
        <P>Since 2002, an advancement of the funds by the Department in a court bond context occurred in the case of three Irish citizens in Colombia. In this particular consular case, the court judgment permitted the three citizens to be released from prison under conditional freedom on payment of a bond. My Department, at the request of the defence team and given the ongoing consular concerns about the safety of the persons concerned advanced the funds to facilitate the payment of this bond on the basis of a firm undertaking to repay the sum involved. The funds were repaid in full. The decision to advance funds was taken by the Department in pursuit of its consular responsibilities, and was neither discussed nor taken at political level.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130, 138 and 286 together.</P>
        <P>Since the comprehensive peace agreement was signed in Nairobi on 9 January 2005, there has been progress in stabilising the long-running conflict between the north and the south of Sudan. Following a delay due to the accidental death in July 2005 of southern leader and first Vice President, John Garang, a Government of national unity was formed in September 2005 in line with the new constitution. An autonomous regional Government of south Sudan was established on 22 October on the basis of the interim constitution for south Sudan.</P>
        <P>Both President Bashir of the National Congress Party and first Vice President, Salva Kiir, on behalf of the south, have expressed their desire to implement the comprehensive peace agreement and, to date, there has been some progress on the implementation of technical and institutional aspects. Also, despite significant administrative and logistical obstacles the Government of south Sudan is gradually establishing itself. However, the Government of national unity needs to be strengthened by the two main coalition partners showing real leadership and working together to address major unresolved issues, including the effective and transparent sharing of oil revenues. On 20 March 2006, the General Affairs and External Relations Council urged the parties to sustain effective and timely implementation of the agreement and reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to continue supporting this process.</P>
        <P>The complexity and difficulty of the prevailing situation in south Sudan should not be underestimated. Millions living there continue to depend on humanitarian assistance. Unfortunately violence remains an obstacle to humanitarian work in the region. On 28 March 2006, a UNHCR logistician died as a result of serious wounds suffered in an attack on the agency&rsquo;s compound in Yei which also left one guard dead and another wounded.</P>
        <P>Continuing tensions in the east of Sudan are a potentially destabilising factor. On 20 March 2006 the EU expressed concern about these tensions, underscored the need for a genuine, single, transparent, comprehensive and inclusive dialogue to address the situation and urged the Government of Sudan and the eastern front opposition parties rapidly to agree on the modalities for this dialogue.</P>
        <P>Since the Darfur crisis began in 2003, Ireland has provided assistance of more than &euro;12.5 million in response to humanitarian needs in the region. At the Oslo international donors&rsquo; conference on Sudan in April 2005, Ireland pledged <Col N="1254"/>support of &euro;15 million to Sudan over the 2005 to 2007 period. Some &euro;9.8 million of this was provided in 2005, including almost &euro;4 million to Darfur. To date in 2006, &euro;1.5 million has been allocated for humanitarian relief in Darfur.</P>
        <P>Some 200,000 Sudanese refugees remain in neighbouring Chad and more than 1.7 million persons are still internally displaced within Darfur itself, including 50,000 people who have been forced from their homes since the beginning of this year. Violent acts continue to be carried out by all sides. Security in many parts of Darfur has steadily deteriorated since September 2005, resulting in worsening violence, widespread destruction of crops and livelihoods and serious violations of human rights. This has seriously affected the ability of humanitarian workers to deliver crucial humanitarian relief to the population of Darfur.</P>
        <P>In western Sudan, the spillover into Darfur of Chad&rsquo;s internal instability has added a dangerous regional dimension to the crisis. With our partners in the EU, Ireland welcomed the agreement reached on 8 February 2006 between Sudan and Chad which should contribute to a reduction of violence in the Darfur region. Improved border security should contribute to better relations between the two countries. It is clear that only a political solution to the problems of Darfur will lead to a lasting solution to the humanitarian crisis in the region.</P>
        <P>Early and successful conclusion of the peace negotiations taking place in Abuja, Nigeria, under the auspices of the AU is absolutely essential. Progress has been slow overall but recently the pace has quickened. In tandem with the recent decision to extend the mandate of the African Union Mission in Sudan, AMIS, the AU has begun a real attempt to bring the parties in Abuja to agreement and set the end of April 2006 as its target date. A first step has been the tabling of an enhanced humanitarian ceasefire proposal by the AU mediator Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim. The EU fully supports the AU&rsquo;s efforts to speed up the Abuja process. With our partners in the EU, we have also underlined the need to establish a clear roadmap for implementation with agreed timetables for action.</P>
        <P>All parties to the Abuja negotiations must show their commitment to peace in Darfur by immediately halting all violations of the current ceasefire agreement, especially attacks on AMIS and humanitarian convoys. They must also give their full commitment to the talks and negotiate positively and flexibly. Violations of the UN arms embargo must be stopped. Ireland and the EU support the imposition of sanctions against those blocking the peace process, committing human rights violations, or violating the ceasefire and the arms embargo. I urge the Government of Sudan to co-operate fully with the ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court of human rights violations in Darfur.</P><Col N="1255"/>
        <P>AMIS has been valuable in creating a favourable environment for the political process and in stabilising the security situation. Sudan has stated that it is prepared to accept the deployment of a UN operation in Darfur after and as part of the conclusion of a peace agreement at the Abuja talks. On 10 March 2006 the AU&rsquo;s peace and security commission, PSC, set a framework for transition from AMIS to a UN operation in Darfur. At the same meeting the AU PSC agreed to extend AMIS&rsquo;s mandate until September 2006. This will permit the UN to carry out thorough planning for the transition in co-operation with the AU. The UN Secretary General is to present to the Security Council by 24 April 2006 a range of operations for a UN operation in Darfur. The EU has offered further support to the AMIS mission in the interim, including an additional &euro;50 million from the African Peace Facility, APF. To date the Government and our partners in the EU have fully supported the AU&rsquo;s role in Darfur, both politically and financially. In 2004-05, Ireland contributed &euro;1.5 million to humanitarian, human rights and policing aspects of the AU&rsquo;s AMIS mission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is now engaged in planning a more operational and value added response to humanitarian crises, through the development of a distinctively Irish rapid response initiative, RRI. This initiative includes the pre-positioning and transportation of humanitarian supplies to disaster areas; the availability of a roster of highly skilled and experienced individuals, including from the Defences Forces, for deployment at short notice to situations of great need; and enhancing our support for international humanitarian response agencies and mechanisms.</P>
        <P>In the context of the reform of the United Nations to make it a more efficient and effective global mechanism, a number of gaps have been identified in terms of its ability to respond to humanitarian crises. A number of these were specified in the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s report, In Larger Freedom. Moreover, the UN&rsquo;s emergency humanitarian co-ordinator, Jan Egeland, commissioned a review of UN&rsquo;s response mechanisms, the Humanitarian Response Review, which detailed where those gaps lie.</P>
        <P>The RRI is very much a part of our strong support for the UN and its programme of reform and a response to the needs set out in both these important reports. It is also a full recognition of the importance which the public places in the need to respond rapidly and effectively to emergencies and disasters. The truly amazing generosity of the public to the tsunami at the end of 2004 is a clear indication of the desire to save and protect lives.</P>
        <P>My Department is taking the lead on the RRI. My officials are working closely with counterparts in the Department of Defence, the Irish Defence Forces, and other relevant Departments to plan, co-ordinate and launch this initiative. We are also in close contact with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, working in emergencies. The effective mobilisation of the skills, knowledge and resources that exist across the public sector and in the public sphere is essential to the successful implementation of all of the elements of the RRI.</P><Col N="1257"/>
        <P>A logistics and humanitarian specialist has been engaged by my Department to assist with the pre-positioning of humanitarian supplies. The specialist, in close consultation with my officials, is preparing and costing a plan for the pre-positioning of supplies to include storage, handling and transport of the supplies. This includes detailed consideration of the quantity and nature of the items to be pre-positioned; the optimal locations; and the logistic and programmatic support required to transport and deliver the supplies. Possible partnerships with other countries and organisations are also being considered with a view to achieving maximum cost effectiveness and efficiency. We are drawing upon the experiences and lessons learned of relevant actors such as large non-governmental organisations, NGOs, donor agencies, and the United Nations.</P>
        <P>My Department is also progressing work on the establishment of a humanitarian rapid response roster. Discussions in this regard have taken place, and are ongoing, with a number of United Nations agencies, including United Nations volunteers, UNV, which operates a personnel roster which deploys to the major UN agencies responding to humanitarian crises as they arise. It will be important to ensure that the roster is made up of highly skilled individuals with the ability to work in the complex and demanding environment of humanitarian crises with UN agencies and NGOs. The profile of such experts is developed on the basis of consultation with our key partner agencies and NGOs.</P>
        <P>A number of discussions have also taken place on the enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s support to key humanitarian response agencies through targeted support for standby arrangements and organisational capacity building for humanitarian response. In this context, Ireland has recently contributed &euro;10 million to the UN&rsquo;s central emergency response fund to strengthen its ability to deal with humanitarian crises.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union will mark the completion of the fifth enlargement process, which will increase the <Col N="1258"/>Union&rsquo;s membership to 27. The Union&rsquo;s objective is to welcome both countries as members on 1 January 2007. The EU could, however, postpone the accession of either or both countries for up to one year if the Commission considers that either country would be unprepared to meet the requirements of membership in 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Commission&rsquo;s annual monitoring reports for Bulgaria and Romania, which were published on 25 October 2005, stated that preparations for membership were well advanced in both countries but highlighted a number of issues needing urgent attention before the date of accession. These include the fight against corruption, the reform of the judiciary, the need to increase capacity to manage EU Structural Funds and the importance of compliance with EU veterinary standards.</P>
        <P>The progress being made by both countries in implementing the necessary reforms is being closely monitored by the Commission and the member states. Association Councils were recently held with both countries &mdash; with Bulgaria on 31 January and with Romania on 20 March. These provided a timely opportunity to review the progress of both countries&rsquo; preparations for membership.</P>
        <P>The Council will make a final decision on the date of accession for Bulgaria and Romania in June on the basis of a recommendation from the Commission, which will be presented in its monitoring reports due to be published in mid-May 2006. Ireland believes that it is important for both countries to make effective use of the coming months to address all outstanding issues so that they can accede to the EU on 1 January 2007. To this end, both countries benefit from the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; bilateral assistance programme, which provides support for new member states, acceding and candidate countries in coping with the considerable challenges of EU membership.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s position on the lifting of the embargo on arms sales to China is clear and has not changed. We support the lifting of the embargo but we do not wish to see an increase in the quantity or quality of arms exports to China. This position was set out by the Taoiseach during his visit to Beijing in January 2005 when he also explained the importance to Ireland and the EU of continued progress in the promotion and protection of human rights in China.</P><Col N="1259"/>
        <P Just="Left">The European Council meeting on 16 and 17 June 2005 was the most recent occasion on which the arms embargo was discussed with EU counterparts. The European Council recalled the conclusions of its December 2004 meeting, welcomed the progress made to date on the revision of the EU code of conduct on arms exports and the so-called toolbox and invited the Council to continue its work on that basis. As the EU works towards lifting the arms embargo, it has also engaged in a dialogue on the issue at senior official level with key partners, including the US, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia. The EU approach was conveyed to Chinese Foreign Minister Li when he met with the Troika of EU Foreign Ministers at the EU-China ministerial meeting held in Vienna on 3 February. The lifting of the arms embargo was also among the issues discussed during the eighth EU-China summit that took place in Beijing on 5 September last.</P>
        <P>The Government continues to examine this issue with its EU partners, in the context of its overall relationship with China, its ongoing commitment to human rights and the broader regional and international context. EU Ministers will resume consideration of a decision on lifting the embargo once work on revising the code of conduct has been completed. A decision to lift the embargo will require the unanimous approval of member states.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the case of the murder of the late Pat Finucane; the most recent talks which he and his Department has held with representatives of the British Government; the position with regard to the need for a public inquiry with particular reference to the need for such to meet the most stringent requirements of international law.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my recent statement to the D&aacute;il on 8 March in support of the all-party motion on the Finucane case, which makes clear the Government&rsquo;s strong support for a full, independent public inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane. The situation with regard to an inquiry was considered in the course of meetings during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations in Washington. The matter was discussed during the meeting which the Taoiseach and I had with President Bush and in contacts with senior figures in the US Senate and House of Representatives. Both the Taoiseach and I met the Finucane family in Washington and my officials assisted the family with other aspects of their programme. I have also had further contact with the Northern <Col N="1260"/>Ireland Secretary of State, Peter Hain. Following the unanimous adoption by the D&aacute;il of the all-party motion, he wrote to me indicating why he felt the UK Inquiries Act 2005 was appropriate in this case. In confirming that I could not share this assessment, my reply emphasised that the all-party motion was a concrete expression of deep and ongoing concern among all parties on this issue.</P>
        <P>Throughout this process, the key question for the Government has been whether what has been proposed by the British Government will contribute to the enhancement of public confidence. It is clear from the reaction in many quarters, including the response of distinguished jurists, human rights groups and the Finucane family, that the answer is in the negative. I concluded my letter to the Secretary of State by making it clear that the Government continued to hope that a way will be found to address these issues in a manner which will meet the legitimate concerns of the Finucane family, and of all who wish to see justice done in this case. That remains our position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 145 together.</P>
        <P>The deterioration in the political and human rights situation in Ethiopia since the May 2005 general election is a matter of serious concern. Ireland, along with our EU partners, continues to emphasise to the Government of Ethiopia, most recently in a meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr. Meles Zenawi, on 17 January 2006, the need to respect human rights and the rule of law; to strengthen the democratisation process by opening a non-conditional dialogue with all opposition parties and allowing those parties and civil society organisations to operate freely; and to allow the private media operate without restrictions.</P>
        <P>Recent positive developments should be noted. An independent investigation commission to examine the June and November 2005 violence was set up by the Ethiopian Parliament in late <Col N="1261"/>November and is expected to report back in the near future. An initiative to reform parliamentary rules of procedure and strengthen the role of the opposition is due to be completed within two months. Measures to improve the procedures and increase the capacity of the national election board are expected to be implemented by June 2006. The Prime Minister has indicated that a review of the draft press law should be finalised by June 2006. The European Development Commissioner, Mr. Louis Michel, visited Addis Ababa on 16 and 17 February 2006 and met the imprisoned leadership of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, CUD, opposition party, the first time such access was allowed to a representative of the international community. He also met the Prime Minister twice. It is understood that 141 out of 173 opposition MPs have entered parliament. Dialogue is under way between the Government and two opposition political parties and the majority of detainees arrested during the unrest last November have been released.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, although the opposition won almost all the seats in the Addis Ababa City Council in June 2005, it remains reluctant to take over this institution as a protest against the detention and trial of the CUD leadership and continuing restrictions on the operations of opposition parties and the private media. On 28 March 2006, the Prime Minister announced that, if the opposition does not assume responsibility for the administration of Addis Ababa by 18 April 2006, a caretaker administration will be appointed and fresh elections held after 12 months. The trial of 129 individuals, some charged <i>in absentia</i>, including the elected leaders of the CUD, journalists, and civil society leaders, began on 23 February 2006. The Ethiopian authorities claim they were responsible for launching and organising the June and November 2005 riots as part of an agenda to overthrow the Government by force. They were charged as a group with treason, genocide and inciting violence.</P>
        <P>Ireland, along with its EU partners, has underlined to the Ethiopian Prime Minister the need for the trial to be conducted in a transparent, fair and speedy manner in accordance with international standards. We also called for the release of the detainees on bail as a confidence building measure and for better access to detainees by families, lawyers and the international community. The Prime Minister agreed to an EU request for international observation of the trial and a distinguished international lawyer, Mr. Michael Ellmann, is observing the trial on behalf of the EU. EU embassies in Addis Ababa, including Ireland&rsquo;s, are also monitoring developments. While bail has not been approved, the Prime Minister has indicated that the Ethiopian authorities will do everything they can to ensure the expeditious completion of the trial and that he expects it to be completed within a year. On 22 March 2006, all charges were withdrawn against <Col N="1262"/>18 of the detainees, including nine being tried <i>in absentia</i>, and the prosecutor was instructed by the court to amend the genocide charge. The next hearing is scheduled for 2 May 2006.</P>

	<P>The Office of the Minister for Children was established in accordance with the Government decision of 7 December 2005 to place the interests of children at the heart of Government and to build on the successes achieved in the national children&rsquo;s strategy. The responsibilities of the new office within the Department of Health and Children will comprise the following: the equal opportunities child care programme, transferred from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the new national child care investment programme, which was announced in the 2006 budget as part of the new national child care strategy for the next five years; the programmes and activities of the former National Children&rsquo;s Office; and policy and legislative work on child welfare and protection conducted by the Department of Health and Children. The new youth justice service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the early years education policy unit of the Department of Education and Science will be co-located at the new office. The purpose in bringing these various responsibilities together is to maximise the co-ordination of policies for children and young persons and to provide a strong focus at the highest level. The Office of the Minister for Children will also maintain a general strategic oversight of bodies with responsibility for developing and delivering children&rsquo;s services.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Children, who holds delegated responsibilities in the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will attend meetings of the Government on a regular basis. This will give a strong voice for the interests of children and young persons at Cabinet. The Office of the Minister for Children is funded through the Department of Health and Children and includes the following: administration, including salaries &mdash; Vote 39; the early child care supplement &mdash; Vote 41; the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 &mdash; Vote 41; the national child care investment programme 2006-2010 &mdash; Vote 41; and the national children&rsquo;s strategy programmes &mdash; Vote 41. While the OMC is responsible for the early child care supplement, the Department of Social and Family Affairs will administer it on an agency basis. In addition, the youth justice service will be funded through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s Vote and the early years education policy unit will be funded through the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s Vote. The establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children has not altered the duties and responsibilities of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

	<P>The functions of the new Office of the Minister for Children, within the Department of Health and Children, are as follows: the equal opportunities child care programme, transferred from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the programmes and activities of the National Children&rsquo;s Office; and the policy and legislative work on child welfare and protection conducted by the Department of Health and Children. The new youth justice service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the early years education functions of the Department of Education and Science will be co-located at the new office. However, these Departments will retain responsibility for these areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Office of the Minister for Children has the lead role on children and young people&rsquo;s participation in local and national decision making under goal 1 of the national children&rsquo;s strategy 2000. It has responsibility for ensuring the development of structures for participation such as D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and for promoting children and young people&rsquo;s participation among Departments, State agencies and the non-government sector.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy de Valera, Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, has overall responsibility for youth affairs. An official from the National Children&rsquo;s Office &mdash; now part of the Office of the Minister for Children &mdash; participated on an interdepartmental committee established in the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science from November 2004 to May 2005. My office is represented on the national youth work advisory committee established by the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993 provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds. General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993, as amended by the 2005 regulations. Under the regulations the Health Service Executive, when considering an application for subvention, carries out a means test which takes into account the means of the applicant and his or her spouse or co-habiting partner, where appropriate, and the assets of the applicant. The HSE imputes an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse, or son or daughter aged less than 21 or in full-time education or in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension, and generally does so unless there are exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <P>Under the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 2005, SI 814 of 2005, the HSE may refuse to pay a subvention if the value of the applicant&rsquo;s principal residence is &euro;500,000 or more, where the residence is located in the Dublin area, or &euro;300,000 or more, where the residence is located outside the Dublin area, and the residence is not occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 or in full-time education or a relative in receipt of a social welfare pension or allowance. It is difficult to estimate the financial impacts, as much depends on individual circumstances but an additional &euro;20 million has been made available for the provision of the subvention scheme in 2006. The recently published Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis throughout the country. It includes a pro<Col N="1267"/>vision to vary the 5% income imputation. I will consider the issue of housing assets and long-term residential care following the enactment of this Bill and in the light of the report of the long-term care working group.</P>

	<P>The expenditure review of the nursing home scheme which was carried out by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea was officially launched on 25 June 2003. This report was launched in tandem with the Mercer study on the future financing of long-term care which was carried out by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>Following on the publication of the Mercer report, a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs was established. The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including improvements in community care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. This group presented its report to Government, where it is under consideration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive, HSE, has a statutory obligation to make available without charge general practitioner services to persons for whom, in the opinion of the executive, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange such services for themselves and their dependants. People who are deemed eligible by the executive are provided with a GP visit card following an assessment of their income and their outgoings.</P>
        <P>The income guidelines used by the executive for GP visit card applications are 25% higher than those for medical cards. The HSE has discretion to grant a GP visit card to persons whose income may be in excess of the guidelines but <Col N="1268"/>whose particular circumstances justify such a decision.</P>
        <P>Over the course of 2005 significant improvements have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. In June 2005, the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards was simplified. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. The guidelines also reflect the family size. In October 2005 the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards were increased by an additional 20%. The HSE has publicised these changes to encourage people to apply and has made the application process as simple as possible. The HSE has also provided a national information helpline.</P>
        <P>The current GP visit card guidelines are set out below. To these amounts are added the reasonable expenses for rent or mortgage, child care and travel to work. The HSE will then compare the applicant or spouse income after income tax and PRSI against the total guideline in making its decision on an application as to whether a medical card or a GP visit card will be approved.</P>

The Second Stage of this Bill is due to resume in the D&aacute;il on 27 April 2006. It is my wish that the important legislative proposals contained in the Bill have a speedy passage through the Oireachtas prior to the summer recess. This will enable the implementation of the scheme to ensure the repayments can be made swiftly to those eligible for repayment, following the completion of an uncomplicated application process.</P>

	<P>On 3 February last, the Health Service Executive published a report on the delivery of tertiary paediatric services in this country. This report was commissioned by the Health Service Executive at my request.</P>
        <P>The report, which was prepared by McKinsey and Company, recommends that best outcomes for children should be provided by one national tertiary paediatric centre, which would also provide all secondary paediatric services for the greater Dublin area. The report recommended that these secondary services would be supported by strategically located accident and emergency facilities.</P>
        <P>Arising from the report&rsquo;s recommendations, a joint HSE-Department of Health and Children task group was established to progress matters and to advise on the optimal location for the new facility. The group&rsquo;s report is expected shortly. When a decision has been taken in relation to the new facility, the HSE will examine the organisational arrangements necessary to progress the development, including the arrangements for the provision of paediatric accident and emergency services. My primary concern is to ensure that we arrive at a solution which is in the best interests of the children of this country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 170 and 191 together.</P>
        <P>There is no statutory obligation on the HSE to provide chiropody services to GMS patients. However, in practice arrangements are made to provide these services. Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time. Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over. In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</P>
        <P>It is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE. My Department requested the HSE to initiate a review of the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service. This review is under way.</P>
        <P>The Deputies&rsquo; questions about the provision of chiropody services relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 183 and 185 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputies&rsquo; questions on human resource management issues are a matter for the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Therefore, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputies.</P>
        <P>I recognise the valuable role of the home help service in enabling people who might otherwise need to be cared for in institutional care to remain at home where appropriate. I am aware that a high level group has been established, with representatives from the Health Service Executive and staff representatives from SIPTU and IMPACT, to address issues pertaining to the standardisation of home help services. The group held its first meeting on 23 March and further meetings are scheduled.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;33 million full year cost was allocated to the home help programme in budget 2006, &euro;30 million of which will be for 2006 with the remaining &euro;3 million in 2007, to enable the Health Service Executive to provide an additional 1.75 million hours nationally in 2006. The additional resource will further enhance the service and facilitate the wishes expressed by many older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>

	<P>The national diabetes working group chaired by the chief medical officer submitted its report to the T&aacute;naiste last summer. The report addressed the epidemiology of diabetes, health promotion and prevention initiatives, including screening and models of care in terms of future service provision.</P>
        <P>Specific recommendations included the development of population and high risk approaches to prevent diabetes; the development of podiatry services as a priority issue to prevent foot care complications; the introduction of a diabetic retinopathy screening programme to prevent eye disease; the development of a diabetes register; the setting out of a model of high quality care which describes what children and adults with diabetes shall expect to receive throughout their lifetime; the prioritisation and reflection of diabetes services in the national service plan of the Health Service Executive; the development of shared care or a model of care developed jointly between primary care and specialist services, which has been shown to be effective in diabetes prevention and in the management of complications; and the support of a planning and service delivery framework based on diabetes service development groups with management responsibilities for planning and delivering services and clinical activities such as the support of clinical networks and the application of protocols for better quality care.</P>
        <P>The report, which was recently published on the Department of Health and Children website, was forwarded to the chief executive of the Health Service Executive in October 2005. The HSE is treating the matter as a priority and is putting in place a structure to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>

	<P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71 provides for the co-ordination of social security systems, including health care, among EU member states. Under the regulation, those who are insured with or covered by the health care system of one member state but who are residing or staying in another member state receive health care in the state of residence or stay on behalf of the member state with which they are insured or covered. Thus, persons who are insured with or covered by the Dutch health insurance system and who reside in Ireland receive health care in Ireland on behalf of the Netherlands. Such persons automatically receive a medical card, regardless of age or means.</P>
        <P>A new health insurance system has now come into force in the Netherlands and the Dutch authorities have advised through the EU forum dealing with administrative matters arising from the operation of Regulation (EC) 1408/71 that the changes introduced may affect Dutch persons resident in member states other than the Netherlands, including Ireland. The changes are entirely a matter for the Netherlands. There has been no change to the EU legislation governing the co-ordination of social security systems, including health care, among member states.</P>

	<P>I have recently received the report, Small Hospital, Big Service, referred to by the Deputy, which was published by the Nenagh Hospital Action Group. The report will be examined by my Department and by the Health Service Executive in the context of its role in the management and delivery of health and social services.</P>
        <P>The Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, the Hanly report, made a series of important recommendations about the development of hospital services. These covered issues such as the changes needed in NCHD work patterns; the need for a significantly revised contract for medical consultants and an increase in the number of consultants; reform of medical education and training; and the reorganisation of acute hospital services. My Department is working closely with the HSE to build on, and progress, these recommendations. Negotiations in relation to NCHD work patterns and on a new contract for consultants have begun.</P>
        <P>On 1 February 2006, together with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, I announced details of a &euro;200 million Government initiative for major reform of medical education and training from undergraduate level through to postgraduate specialist training. The reforms are based on the recommendations in the report of the postgraduate medical education and training group, chaired by Dr. Jane Buttimer, and the report of the working group on undergraduate <Col N="1281"/>medical education and training, chaired by Professor Pat Fottrell. These two reports make a series of comprehensive recommendations for the development and reform of medical education and is the most significant review of the medical education and training field ever undertaken in Ireland.</P>
        <P>These measures, combined with ongoing investment in acute hospital facilities, extra consultant posts and the organisation of services around hospital networks, are designed to provide patients with faster access to high-quality consultant provided services. A new independent external review of all acute hospital services in the mid-west and how they can be developed in accordance with best practice has been approved by the Health Service Executive. The report undertaken by the Nenagh Hospital Action Group will be taken into account as a key component of the review process. The review is to be completed by the end of the year following which the findings will be published.</P>

	<P>The Department of Health and Children remains responsible for the development of alcohol policy. However, it is recognised that an integrated approach is required for effective implementation. The Department has led on the establishment of a strategic task force on alcohol and a working group on alcohol and the three reports of these groups form the basis for current alcohol policy. Since the restructuring of the Department, the Health Service Executive has assumed responsibility for the implementation of many of the recommendations outlined in these reports. It is a matter for the HSE to decide on the structural requirements and levels of expertise needed in this regard. There are no plans to appoint a national adviser on alcohol policy in this Department.</P>

	<P>Article 16.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 provides that individuals resident in private nursing homes who are in receipt of a subvention from the health board may not be charged extra for any service which is considered to be essential to their maintenance in the home and common practice in most nursing homes. Such services include bed and board, nursing care appropriate to the level of dependency of the person and incontinence wear.</P>
        <P>In February 2001, a letter was issued by the Department of Health and Children to the former health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority requesting that the necessary arrangements be put in place so that all medical card holders in receipt of subvention be supplied with incontinence wear under a similar arrangement as is in place for those living in the community. Arrangements are currently in place in the majority of areas for the supply of incontinence wear to medical card holders in private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>From 2003 additional funding was allocated towards the nursing home subvention scheme to assist with the costs of supplying incontinence wear to patients in private nursing homes who are in receipt of a subvention under the nursing home subvention scheme. This funding also assists with costs associated in managing the scheme and pro<Col N="1284"/>viding training and education in relation to incontinence issues.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available. The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, which reports to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is the statutory body with responsibility for monitoring the incidence of work-related accidents. Data are reported to the HSA on those accidents at work, excluding self-employed and certain other categories, which result in at least three days absence from work. The information recorded does not indicate whether those who have suffered an injury attended a hospital accident and emergency department for treatment. Statistics collected by my Department for 2005 show there were a total of 1.25 million accident and emergency unit attendances nationally. It is not, however, possible with present information systems to ascertain what proportion of these visits were due to work-related accidents.</P>
        <P>A pilot project is under way to widen the range of information collected on accident and emergency attendances. The project is part of a harmonised EU initiative under the auspices of the public health programme of the EU Commission and is being led by the National Suicide Research Foundation in Ireland. The objective will be to replace the previous system which was restricted to home and leisure accidents to cover all injuries attending accident and emergency units. The new system is being tested throughout the EU and, in Ireland, is being piloted at present in the six hospitals of the Health Service Executive southern region.</P>

	<P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>The increasing numbers of people from different ethnic minority groups living and working in Ireland has contributed to a rich mix of diversity in the country. At the same time, the need to address the health and support needs of this diverse group in a way appropriate to their culture, has posed challenges for the health services. A number of initiatives have been undertaken aimed at ensuring equal access to health care including the launch of the booklet, Equal Status Acts 2000-2004 and provision of health services. This booklet has been developed as a collaborative initiative by my Department, the HSE and the Equality Authority. It aims to support health service organisations in becoming fully equality competent bodies, committed to ensuring an equality focus on all aspects of service provision and employment. Another initiative is the development of a national equality strategy by the HSE, the initial steps of which have already commenced. The national intercultural strategy, addressing the health and support needs of persons from ethnic minorities, has been developed. This strategy, consistent with the requirements contained in the national action plan against racism, will build on the good practice already reflected throughout the country in ensuring a responsive, culturally sensitive approach to service provision to the unique health care and support needs of asylum seekers, refugees, migrant workers, Travellers and other members of minority ethnic communities.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>Much work has been done in parts of the country to reduce barriers experienced by ethnic minorities. Specific measures include the completion of an equal status review in the north west of Ireland, the provision of a range of services targeted at specific health needs of people from ethnic minorities and the provision of interpretation services in different administrative areas. Experience from these and other related initiatives will inform expansion or enhancement of relevant services across the country. Significant efforts have also been made in relation to staff training and support needs in working with people from minority ethnic communities. Plans concerning the roll-out of a national programme are at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>The development of an ethnic identifier, successfully piloted in the area of Traveller health, is a priority for the HSE in 2006. Information gained from use of the ethnic identifier will be applied towards identification of needs, measurement of uptake of services and evaluation of outcomes. Service users from ethnic minorities will be actively involved in planning, implementation and evaluation of this and all other relevant initiatives.</P>

	<P>The most recent figures from the national physical and sensory disability database, NPSDD, annual report 2004, which is managed by the Health Research Board, show 1,791 people as having being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In interpreting this data, it is important to note that as not everyone in this country with a physical or sensory disability is availing of a specialised health and personal social service, the NPSDD will not provide any definite epidemiological statement on the number of people with a particular type of disability.</P>

	<P>A common list of reimbursable medicines is in place for the general medical services and drug payment schemes to ensure equity in respect of the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. For a product to be reimbursable under the two schemes, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it <Col N="1288"/>is ordinarily supplied to the public only by medical prescription and that it should not be advertised or promoted to the public. Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that would not normally satisfy these criteria in that they are generally available over-the-counter, and may be advertised directly to the public.</P>
        <P>Nicotine replacement therapies are available to medical card holders on foot of recommendations made by the cardiovascular health strategy group and the advisory forum established to support the task force in the implementation of strategy. Evidence shows that lower socioeconomic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco and that, in general, their health is worse. Therefore, it was considered that members of this group are in greatest need of assistance in helping them to quit the habit. Accordingly, and in light of the recommendations that were made, it was decided, as an exceptional measure to make the full range of nicotine replacement therapies available on prescription to medical card holders. There are no plans to extend this to the drug payment scheme.</P>

In the interim, advice received from the Attorney General raised some questions about the constitutional implications of no fault schemes in general.

Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note, however, that additional investment in speech and language therapy services in recent years, coupled with enhancements in the professional training, career development and remuneration of these therapists, have led to significant improvements in staffing levels. These developments are in line with the recommendations contained in the 2000 report of the expert group on various health professions, which included new pay scales and enhanced career structures.</P>
        <P>In general, developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have all supported increased staffing levels for key health and social care professions, including speech and language therapists. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body made a further important contribution to recruitment and improved retention. The continued implementation of the action plan for people management, a key action under the health strategy, has a crucial role in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled staff.</P>
        <P>The success of all these measures have contributed to an increase of 162 speech and language therapists, or 42% over the number employed by <Col N="1292"/>the end of December 2000, and reflects significant increases in the numbers employed in promotional grades. There were 548 whole-time equivalent speech and language therapists employed in the public health service by the end of September 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, three new speech and language therapy courses commenced in the 2003-04 academic year in UCC, NUIG and UL. In total, these courses provide an additional 75 training places in speech and language therapy. This expansion in training numbers was identified in the Bacon report of 2001, current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists, as sufficient to meet the long-term demand-supply balance for speech and language therapists in Ireland. The first graduates from the two year masters course in UL completed their studies in June 2005. The first graduates from the BSc courses in UCC and NUIG will graduate in 2007.</P>
        <P>Essential to the successful roll out of these additional training places is the provision of sufficient quality clinical placements in speech and language therapy. The revenue funding I have provided this year, along with that allocated in the past two years for the three therapy professions, totals &euro;4.6 million. It is expected that approximately 30% of this amount will go towards the speech and language therapy profession and will enable the Health Service Executive, working with my Department, to put in place the enhanced structures necessary to ensure that students will have access to a sustainable, high-quality clinical training model.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 to 224, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the tax exemption which is being introduced for income from childminding is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance, to avail of it a childminder must elect to make a voluntary notification of his or her childminding service to the person recognised by the HSE for this purpose, effectively the local city or <Col N="1295"/>county child care committee, CCC. This will further strengthen the voluntary notification system already operated by the CCCs and supported by the childminder advisory officers.</P>
        <P>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, it is necessary to outline the position in regard to notification, both voluntary and as required under the Child Care Act 1991. Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 provides for the supervision of pre-school services, including the imposition of a requirement on persons operating pre-school services to notify their service to the Health Service Executive, HSE. A number of categories of persons providing pre-school services are excluded from this requirement, including a person taking care of not more than three pre-school children of different families, other than that person&rsquo;s own such children, in that person&rsquo;s home. A pre-school child is defined as a child who has not attained the age of six years and who is not attending a national school or a school providing an educational programme similar to a national school.</P>
        <P>Many childminders are covered by this exemption, however, to facilitate childminders who wish to participate in and avail of the range of quality initiatives introduced under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06, EOCP, a voluntary notification system was introduced and is operated at local level through the CCCs established under the EOCP. Some 1,000 childminders have notified their local CCC under this system. As the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, I will be responsible for the administration of both the EOCP and the new National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010.</P><Col N="1296"/>
        <P>It will be clear from the above that the necessary arrangements and staffing to operate the voluntary notification system were already in place prior to the introduction of the tax exemption announced in budget 2006. The additional numbers of notifications by childminders arising from the introduction of the tax exemption will be accommodated within these existing arrangements and will not give rise to a need for additional staffing or other resources. As the Deputy will appreciate, a wide range of new measures in respect of child care were announced in budget 2006, including the new National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 under which the CCCs will have an enhanced role in identifying and supporting local child care needs. As a result, steps are being taken to further develop and resource the CCCs. In addition, the OMC held a major conference in January 2006 to outline the new programme and budget changes to the CCCs. This has been followed by a series of seminars and information sessions to assist the CCCs in carrying out their role.</P>
        <P>With regard to the number of inquiries received and voluntary notifications made to the CCCs since the budget announcement, I understand from inquiries and the information available that the position is as indicated in the following table. Where it has not been possible to obtain details in the time available, I will arrange for this information to be forwarded to you in the coming days. I understand that the OMC has not recorded any significant number of enquiries regarding the exemption. It is not possible to say at this stage whether any significant increase in enquiries or notifications will arise in the period between now and October 2007 when the first tax returns in relation to the exemption will be due for return.</P><Col N="1295"/>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the implementation of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 and provide for notification to and inspection by the Health Service Executive of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, play groups, day nurseries, cr&egrave;ches, childminders looking after more than three pre-school children other than their own such children in the childminders&rsquo; own homes and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
        <P>The notification and inspection service is managed by the pre-school inspection teams of the <Col N="1299"/>Health Service Executive, which are appointed by the executive as authorised persons for this purpose. These teams also provide an advisory service to the services that are statutorily required to notify in order to assist them in achieving and maintaining the appropriate standard. They also provide information to interested persons, including parents, on pre-school services in the area.</P>
        <P>Following inspection of a service, the inspector provides the service provider with a report on the outcome of the inspection. The teams then work closely with service providers in addressing the recommendations of the inspection reports. Where persistent breaches of legislation occur, the Health Service Executive can initiate prosecutions. In addition, the inspection teams, on receipt of a warrant from the District Court, can inspect a premises where it is believed that a pre-school service is being carried on without notification having been given to the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>In 2001, a childminder advisory service was put in place to support and advise childminders of pre-school children who are exempt from notification under the legislation, that is, those caring for three or fewer pre-school children, a sibling group of pre-school children or pre-school children of relatives. Such childminders are encouraged to voluntarily notify this service. The childminder advisory service is operated at local level through the CCCs-HSE. The childminder advisory officers provide networking opportunities, advice, advisory visits, support and training for childminders who voluntarily notify.</P>

	<P>The position is that the calculation of the farmers&rsquo; flat rate is governed by EU VAT law and is based on the relevant macroeconomic data for the farming sector for the preceding three years. The purpose of the flat rate addition is to compensate unregistered farmers for VAT which they incur on their business inputs. The flat rate addition is not a mechanism for providing income support to farmers or to compensate for increases in wages or costs generally.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the EU sixth VAT directive and Irish VAT law, most education and training establishments, including primary and secondary level schools, are exempt from VAT. This means that they do not charge VAT on the services they supply but cannot recover VAT on the goods and services that they purchase. Essentially, only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P><Col N="1303"/>
        <P>It is normal for state funded services to bear VAT on their purchases. However, Exchequer funding for such services, including primary and secondary schools, takes account of VAT when allocations are being made by the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal position in respect of VAT on tolls was clarified by the European Court of Justice in September 2000 in a series of rulings concerning the VAT treatment of tolls in Ireland, France, the United Kingdom and Greece.</P>
        <P>The position is that, in principle, the activity of providing access to roads on payment of a toll is a supply of services subject to VAT under the conditions of the sixth directive. Under Article 4(5) of the directive, if the State, regional or local government authorities or other bodies governed by public law carry out this activity acting as public authorities, the services do not fall within the scope of VAT, unless their non-taxation would lead to a significant distortion of competition. The European Court of Justice examined the conditions under which toll roads are operated in Ireland and ruled that because the tolls are operated by a private concern, the tolls are subject to VAT.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 255 together.</P>
        <P>The standard rate band for a married single earner couple was substantially increased in value in budget 2006 by &euro;2,600 per annum from &euro;38,400 to &euro;41,000. The standard band for a single person was also increased by &euro;2,600 per annum from &euro;29,400 to &euro;32,000. As a result of the changes, a single earner may earn up to &euro;32,000 in 2006 before paying the higher rate of tax. A married single earner couple may earn up to &euro;41,000 before facing tax at the higher rate and a married dual earner couple may earn up to &euro;64,000 before facing the higher rate of tax.</P>
        <P>All categories of taxpayer benefited from the income tax changes in budget 2006. No taxpayer has been disadvantaged relative to their former position. The changes reflect a consistent approach by the Government to ease the tax burden on income earners, which has seen the average tax rate fall for all taxpayers, married or single, since 1997. We are well to the fore in this regard compared to other tax regimes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In fact, the most recent data available from the OECD show that, in 2005, a married single income couple with two children on average earnings in Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the entire OECD. In addition, when cash transfers from the State are taken into account, such couples face a negative burden in Ireland because they receive more in the cash transfers than they pay out in social security contributions. Ireland is unique in the OECD in this respect. These data do not even take into account the further changes in budget 2006 including, for example, the introduction of the early child care supplement and increases in child benefit payments.</P>
        <P>This bears out the fact that this Government has radically improved the position of all taxpayers and single income taxpayers as well since 1997.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) 2004/39/EC was adopted on 21 April 2004 and published in the EC&rsquo;s Official Journal <Col N="1305"/>on 20 April 2004. The original deadline set for its transposition was two years after its publication, ie 30 April 2006. However, this was subsequently revised, owing to the very technical nature of the directive and the resources which would be required to comply with it. The new deadline is 31 January 2007 for transposition and a deadline for industry of 1 November 2007. Arrangements for transposition in Ireland are well advanced.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243, 244 and 246 together.</P>
        <P>Both the Government and I have made it clear that participation in the decentralisation programme is voluntary. From the outset, guarantees have been provided at Government level that all those employees not wishing to transfer out of Dublin will be facilitated with an alternative public service post in Dublin. This position has not changed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the Civil Service, progress has been made in discussions with the general service unions on issues relating to transfer protocols, promotions and arrangements for staff remaining in Dublin. Discussions are ongoing on these issues with the unions representing the professional and technical grades in the Civil Service. I hope these and other decentralisation issues arising in the State agency sector can be discussed with the relevant unions with a view to arriving at arrangements <Col N="1306"/>which support the decentralisation process while also meeting the concerns of staff.</P>
        <P>In regard to F&Aacute;S, it would be helpful to refer specifically to the Labour Court ruling. In its recent recommendation in a dispute between SIPTU and F&Aacute;S concerning decentralisation and F&Aacute;S contracts of employment, the Labour Court considered the written and oral submissions of the parties. The court also noted the terms of the company-union industrial relations procedures agreement and said that it was of the opinion that F&Aacute;S was in breach of the consultation procedures provided for in that agreement. It made no ruling on the substantive issue of the relocation clause. The court recommended that the matter be referred back to the appropriate central body, at which level the issues should be teased out with a view to arriving at agreed long-term solutions, in consultation with all the parties involved.</P>
        <P>I strongly support the full use of existing industrial relations structures by all the parties involved and believe that this represents the best way forward. It is only through dialogue that all the issues raised can be addressed. On this issue, discussions are scheduled under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission on Tuesday, 4 April.</P>

	<P>The position is that tax relief is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual to an approved college in respect of certain full-time or part-time undergraduate courses and postgraduate courses. The current maximum amount of relief per course per academic year in respect of third level fees is &euro;5,000 at the standard rate of tax.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tax relief is also available in respect of fees paid for training courses in the area of information technology and foreign languages. Tax relief is available at the standard rate of income tax where the tuition fees for an approved course are more than &euro;315. Relief is not available where the tuition fees are less than &euro;315. The current maximum amount of relief is &euro;1,270 per course at the standard rate of tax. Tuition fees paid by an individual on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian qualify for tax relief. Relief may be claimed at the end of the tax year or, for PAYE taxpayers, the relief may be claimed by way of amending the tax credit certificate during the tax year when the fees have been paid. Tax relief is available for tuition fees only. <Col N="1307"/>It is not available in respect of administration or examination fees or in respect of any part of tuition fees that are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, by an employer or otherwise.</P>
        <P>The information leaflet, IT31, in respect of tax relief on tuition fees is available on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie.</i> Annual lists of approved third level colleges in the State, approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the State, and approved course providers and courses for information technology and foreign languages are also available on the Revenue website. The application form for claiming the relief is contained in the information leaflet.</P>
        <P>In regard to the specific case raised by the Deputy, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not received any claim for relief for tuition fees from the taxpayer to date. They have, however, sent the person a copy of the information leaflet.</P>

With regard to VAT charged in Northern Ireland and in line with double taxation provisions within EU member states, a refund of such VAT paid may be sought by the purchaser of the vehicle from the appropriate VAT office in that jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>With regard to vehicle registration tax, a motorcycle is deemed to be a new means of transport where it was supplied three months or less after the date of first entry into service.

	<P Just="Left">By virtue of the Pensions (Abatement) Act 1965, any civil servant or prison officer who is re-employed in the Civil Service is liable to pension abatement in situations where his or her post retirement income from the Civil Service exceeds the current income for their job prior to retirement.</P>
        <P>The statutory abatement provisions are not a discouraging factor to post retirement re-employment. In the case of a prison officer, abatement only applies if during the period of post retirement employment, the person&rsquo;s total income exceeds the current equivalent of the salary and reckonable allowances they had been in receipt of while serving as a prison officer. That is their combined income from pension and their new employment can be the same, but no more, than the current value of the income of their previous job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy may also wish to note that, in general, abatement for retired civil servants and prison officers only applies if they are subsequently re-employed in the Civil Service. Abatement would not apply if a retired civil servant or prison officer works elsewhere in the public service or in the private sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>While the promotion of biofuels and other renewable energy is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in the Finance Act 2006, which has recently completed its passage through the D&aacute;il and Seanad, I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland. The new large-scale scheme of excise relief for biofuels to be established &mdash; building on the current pilot scheme &mdash; will provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum; cost over &euro;200 million over five years, starting this year; when fully operational, result in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum; meet a target of 2% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2008; help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels; and stimulate activity in the agricultural sector. As a complementary measure, I have provided for a new 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles &mdash; cars designed to operate on biofuels &mdash; for an initial period of two years, and also extended the existing VRT relief for hybrid cars by a further year to end 2007. These are major initiatives aimed at promoting biofuels in Ireland.</P>
        <P>With respect to the excise relief scheme, as any such scheme is deemed a State aid by the European Commission, the necessary approval from the Commission is required. Preliminary discussions have already taken place between the Department of Finance, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the European Commission in this regard. Once approval has been granted, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will advertise the scheme to potential beneficiaries and set out the procedures for applying for the excise relief. There are also available two tax incentives that relate to renewable energy generally as follows. Investments in companies engaged in renewable energy generation may qualify for the business expansion scheme tax relief. Individual investors holding a BES equity investment in such companies for a minimum period of five years can benefit from tax relief, at their marginal rate, in respect of investments of up to &euro;31,750 per year. A qualifying company may raise equity capital up to a general maximum of &euro;1 million in the lifetime of the company. Section 486B corporate tax relief applies to corporate equity investments in certain renewable energy generation projects which are eligible for tax relief in the form of a deduction from a company&rsquo;s profits for its investment in new ordinary shares in a qualifying company. To qualify for this relief, the energy project must be in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories, and must be approved by the Minister for <Col N="1310"/>Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The relief is capped at the lesser of 50% of the relevant cost of the project or &euro;9.525 million for a single project. Investment by a company or companies is capped at &euro;12.7 million per annum. The shares must be retained for at least five years by the company, otherwise the relief may be withdrawn.</P>

	<P>The Department of Finance, in common with all other Civil Service Departments and offices, fully implements the Government&rsquo;s policy on the employment of people with a disability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy may wish to note that, as part of a review of policy on the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service, my Department commissioned independent research into the operation of the 3% employment target. A survey carried out as part of this research, which was published as Employment and Career Progression of people with a disability in the Irish Civil Service, IPA 2002, shows that 7% of Civil Service staff have a disability compared with the 2% to 3% generally reported in the annual surveys. The consultants, therefore, concluded that the arrangements in regard to reporting disabilities needed to be addressed.</P>
        <P>In the light of the consultants&rsquo; recommendations, the Government approved proposals from the Minister for Finance to improve the operation of the existing policy. These included, first, the development, in conjunction with the staff unions, of a new code of practice for all Departments to support staff with a disability and, second, ensuring that the Civil Service continues to provide employment opportunities which might not otherwise exist for people with a disability.</P>
        <P>The possible use of a survey based on voluntary self-disclosure both for new staff on appointment and for existing staff will be considered in discussion with the staff unions as part of the development of the code of practice. As this gives rise to complex issues about confidentiality and the use of information, specific guidelines on these matters are being examined as part of the new code of practice for the Civil Service. It is estimated that the percentage of staff in the Department of Finance with a disability currently stands at 2.85% based on reporting arrangements which as outlined above are under review.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that vehicle registration tax, VRT, may be payable on the importation of a vehicle from Great Britain and Northern Ireland into the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a general rule, all vehicles imported permanently into the State from Great Britain and Northern Ireland or elsewhere must register for VRT purposes within one working day of their arrival in the State. However, in practice, Revenue allows latitude of a maximum of seven days for registration. VRT is payable on the open market selling price, OMSP, of the vehicle which is the expected retail price of the vehicle in the State, inclusive of all taxes. Cars such as saloons, estates, hatchbacks, convertibles, coupes etc., and minibuses with less than 12 permanently fitted passenger seats are classified as category A vehicles for VRT and as such are charged VRT based on the engine size of the car using the following calculation: less than 1400 cc at 22.5% of OMSP; from 1401 to 1900 cc at 25% of OMSP; and 1901 cc and over at 30% of OMSP, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;315.00. Car derived vans and crew cabs of less than 3,500 kg gross vehicle weight are charged at 13.3% of OMSP, while commercial and agricultural vehicles pay a flat rate of &euro;50.00 regardless of OMSP.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These calculations are used for both new and second-hand cars, so that the VRT payable is <Col N="1312"/>based on the OMSP of the car on importation into the State. The OMSP for new cars is determined by the main motor distributors while the OMSP of second-hand cars is determined by the Revenue Commissioners, based on market surveys, study of trade magazines, personal contact with the trade and other relevant material. While the statistics sought with respect to used cars are available, as those registering must declare previous country of registration, such a declaration is not included as part of the process with respect to registration of new cars and consequently the same data for new cars are not available. Revenue confirmed that 6,220 second-hand cars were imported from the UK in 2003, 10,641 in 2004 and 24,994 in 2005. Separately, Revenue confirms that 798 second-hand cars were imported from Northern Ireland in 2003, 1,513 in 2004 and 8,883 in 2005. Appendix 1 provides details of all new and second-hand vehicles imported into Ireland for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. The Deputy may wish to note that VAT is chargeable at the rate of 21% of the invoice price, and is payable at the time of registration for VRT purposes, on all &ldquo;new means of transport&rdquo;. A &ldquo;new means of transport&rdquo; for VAT is a vehicle that is supplied six months or less after the first date of entry into service and has travelled less than 6,000 km. VAT is not chargeable where a vehicle is not a new means of transport and is imported from within the EU.</P>
        <P>We are aware that there has been a growth in the number of used cars purchased in the UK and Northern Ireland and imported into the State in recent years. However, from our perspective, the monetary benefits, if any, of pursuing this option may be negligible as the requirement to pay VRT on importation is aimed at reflecting the price of a similar car in Ireland, the purchaser is exposed to currency risks and long-term issues may emerge for the purchaser with respect to after-sales service.</P><Col N="1311"/>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The climate change strategy says that, from 2002 onwards, taxes will begin to take into account the amounts of greenhouse gases produced in any activity. It is Government policy to take greenhouse gas emission into account when formulating or developing tax policy in any particular area.</P>
        <P>In September 2004, the Government decided not to introduce a specific carbon tax, following a thorough examination of the issues involved, including how a carbon tax would be implemented and the associated environmental, economic and social impacts. In addition, my Department carried out an extensive consultation <Col N="1315"/>process in which 117 written submissions were received. Following this examination, the Government decided that a carbon tax was not an appropriate policy option and that, instead, it would intensify action on the other measures under the national climate change strategy. The Government concluded that the environmental benefits of a carbon tax would not justify the difficulties that would arise, particularly for households, from the introduction of such a tax. In this respect, the carbon energy tax would have imposed price increases on many products already suffering sharp increases, particularly as a result of increases in international oil prices. While a carbon tax would have involved a range of compensatory measures, these would not fully address the adverse economic and social effects arising. Moreover, a carbon tax would apply to products which are in the main already subject to excise duties and where a new tax is not necessary to increase tax rates.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The carbon energy tax was just one possible element of the Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to which the Government remains fully committed. Taxation can play a part in attaining environmental objectives. However, as Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that, in developing policy on tax measures, we take into account any effects on Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness, particularly in regard to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>
        <P>Apart from the carbon tax, the national climate change strategy envisages other initiatives in the tax area with one such example being tax reliefs for &ldquo;green initiatives&rdquo;. This approach uses the tax system to provide incentives for certain behaviour. In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to the significant biofuels excise relief scheme which I announced in the budget and for which provision has been made in Finance Act 2006, which has recently completed its passage through the D&aacute;il and Seanad. The Act also provides a new 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles &mdash; cars designed to operate on biofuels &mdash; for an initial period of two years. Emissions trading is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Finance Act 2001 introduced a new scheme of tax relief on donations made by either individuals or corporate bodies to eligible charities and other approved bodies, including first and second level schools and third level institutions, including universities. The minimum qualifying donation for relief purposes to an eligible charity or approved body is &euro;250 per annum. Amending the scheme to allow tax relief on all donations rather than on donations of &euro;250 and over, as the Deputy has proposed, would significantly increase the current cost of the scheme to the Exchequer. The relief is already very generous. There is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated generally and relief is granted at the donor&rsquo;s marginal rate of income tax. Donations can be cumulative, so that a donation of just &euro;5 per week over the course of a year would qualify, for example.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the donations scheme was one of the tax reliefs examined as part of last year&rsquo;s overall review of tax reliefs and exemptions. The review concluded that the &euro;250 minimum threshold is serving its purpose and should be retained at its current level, subject to ongoing review. I agree with this conclusion. The Deputy may wish to note that the full text<?oasys _jy ?>of the review can be found on the Department<?oasys _jy ?>of Finance&rsquo;s website at <i>www.finance.gov.ie/ documents/publications/other/revtaxreliefsvol3.pdf</i>.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Fishery rates are imposed and collected by the regional fisheries boards on the occupier of the fishery, thus forming part of the boards&rsquo; resources. The rates struck by the boards are subject to confirmation by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, with or without modification as he thinks proper, section 55(1), Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 as amended by paragraph 1(<i>d</i>) of the Fourth Schedule to the Fisheries Act 1980 and further modified by the Fisheries (Alteration of Fishery Year) Order 1982, SI No. 328 of 1982.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The rates of increase are based on the recommendation of each regional fisheries board and are generally in line with or greater than the annual rate of inflation as set out in the consumer price index for the previous year. The rate of inflation for the year 2005 according to the Central Statistics Office was 2.5%. In November 2005 each of the regional fisheries boards was asked to propose a rate for 2006.

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government introduced a scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels under the Finance Act 2004, which was launched in April 2005. Eight projects have been awarded excise relief for a two year period under the scheme including four pure plant oil, three biodiesel or other biofuel and one bioethanol proposal. It is estimated that the pilot scheme will result in 16 million litres of biofuels being placed on the Irish transport market by next year.</P>
        <P>Building on the success of the pilot biofuels scheme, the Department has agreed with the Minister for Finance a further targeted package of excise relief valued at &euro;205 million, which was announced in the budget. The new excise relief programme, which is subject to State-aid approval, will be rolled out from this year to 2010 and will enable us to reach the initial target of 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008. When fully operational, the relief is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year. The Department is also providing funding towards the capital cost of developing biofuels processing facilities, which will critically underpin the excise relief package.</P>
        <P>The multi-annual financial package for renewables announced in the 2006 budget included a grant aid package for the domestic sector, which the Department launched on 25 March. This package will provide for individual grants to install renewable energy heat technologies including wood pellet boilers, solar panels and geothermal heat pumps. A financial package for wood chip and wood pellet boilers, aimed at the business, commercial and service sectors, along with a grant aid package to incentivise the installation of combined heat and power in the industrial, commercial and public services sector was also included in the budget package. The Depart<Col N="1320"/>ment, in conjunction with Sustainable Energy Ireland, is developing the necessary detailed measures to roll out these other programmes.</P>
        <P>The Department also proposes to change the support mechanism for renewable energy projects from competitive tendering to a new fixed price tariff system. The draft terms and conditions of the proposed renewable energy feed in tariff or REFIT programme have been the subject of public consultation and the views received have usefully informed the shape of the programme. The Department is currently in consultations with the Office of the Attorney General regarding drafting of the new arrangements and I expect to be in a position to launch the REFIT programme in the near future.</P>

	<P>While the landing figures for lobster catches are taken from the buyers at the time of sale, this information includes the port of landing for the vessel that landed the catch. The reason is that the majority of boats that fish for lobster are under ten metres in length, and consequently are not required to submit logsheets to the Department. The catch figure is subsequently allocated to the relevant port so that the statistics accurately reflect the ports where the catch is landed. For example, the Department&rsquo;s records show that there were 15 tonnes of lobster landed into Achill in 2003 and 12 tonnes in 2004. There are no plans at present to change this procedure.</P>

	<P>The following is the information sought by the Deputy. It is regretted that it was not possible to provide the information earlier but additional time was required to ensure that a comprehensive and detailed statistical response could be collated for all elements of the Deputy&rsquo;s previous questions on this matter.</P>
        <P>My Department has compiled the requested fisheries statistics on the landings, both volume <Col N="1322"/>and value, of Irish fishing vessels of quota species into Irish ports and into non-national ports for each of the past five years as well as the quotas that applied for these fish species. These fishery statistics are presented in the following appendices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Appendix one consists of five separate tables with the quotas for each fish species that applied for that year and the quantity of each species of fish caught and landed by Irish fishing vessels into Irish ports and into non-national ports; this is broken down into other member states and non-EU countries.</P>
        <P>Appendix two consists of five separate tables that present data on the total volume and value for each species landed for each year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The following advisory notes will assist the Deputy&rsquo;s understanding of the fisheries statistics. The stock area defined in each of the tables is by definition a geographical area within which a catch allocation is made for an individual fish species. The geographical scope of a stock area is usually composed of one or more ICES sub-areas. The defined stock areas are subject to change from year to year and as a result direct correlation of the data from one year to the next is not possible in all cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The data contained in these tables of fisheries statistics are the officially recorded statistics as reported to the European Commission. The data presented are accurate at the time of my reply but it should be noted that some of these officially reported statistics may be subject to change depending on the outcome of a number of investigations currently being carried out. With regard to the value of fish landed into non-national ports this has had to be estimated as there is no reporting requirement within the European framework for the reporting of fishery statistics to include the value of landed catches The value applied to fish landed into Ireland by Irish fishing vessels is based on an estimated average price at the time of landing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In appendix one the data are displayed in the following format: column one identifies the fish species. Column two identifies the stock area within which the quota allocation has been made. Column three contains the quota, adjusted following swop arrangements with fellow member states, allocated to Ireland for that species in that year. Column four contains details of the volume of fish landed by Irish fishing vessels into Irish ports. Column five contains details of the volume of fish landed by Irish fishing vessels into non-national ports. Column six contains details of the volume of fish landed by Irish fishing vessels into ports outside the EU.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In appendix two the data are displayed in the following format. Column one contains details of the fish species for which there has been a quota allocation. Column two contains details of the volume, expressed in live weight, of the fish <Col N="1323"/>landed. Column three contains details of value of the landings using the national average price per tonne in euro for that species. Column four contains the total estimated value at first sale for each species.</P><Col N="1324"/>
        <P>At the bottom of each table in appendix two the total estimated value for all quota species caught and landed by Irish fishing vessels during the year is recorded.</P><Col N="1323"/>

        <Quest>the position regarding the installation of smolt tagging and counters in the Southern Regional Fisheries Board area; when he intends to provide funds for this work; and when he further intends to instruct the Marine Institute to commence this work; and if he will make a statement on the matter </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Marine Institute that smolt traps have been operated on the River Suir for the past three years under a joint Marine Institute-Southern Regional Fisheries Board project in an attempt to intercept sufficient wild salmon smolts for tagging with coded wire tags and subsequent release into the Suir. The purpose of this programme is to ascer<Col N="1348"/>tain the extent of interception of the returning adults in various mixed stock fisheries around the coast and has involved considerable effort on behalf of the Marine Institute in co-operation with staff of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board. In 2006, it is intended to place a second smolt trap into the River Suir to improve the trapping of descending smolts. Preparations have already begun and the traps should be operational by the middle of April, in time for the peak smolt run which should be around the first two weeks of May.</P>
        <P>It was anticipated that the smolt trapping on such a large river system might take a number of years to refine and for this reason a secondary programme was initiated by the Marine Institute and the Southern Regional Fisheries Board in 2005, with the release of 10,000 hatchery reared and tagged smolts into the River Suir. Returns from these released fish will be obtained during the 2006 fishery, and will provide information on where River Suir fish may be intercepted in mixed stock salmon fisheries off the Irish coast. This programme will continue in 2006 when a batch of 10,000 reared tagged smolts will be released into the River Barrow. Suitable release locations have recently been identified. The smolts have been tagged and vaccinated and will be released in early April. Returns from these releases will not be available until after the 2007 season.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The overall management of the national fish counter programme has, to date, been primarily the responsibility of the Marine Institute, which has operated directly or by sub-contracting where necessary in order to maintain the objectives of the programme. The Marine Institute in conjunction with the regional fisheries boards, fishery owners, engineers from this Department and consultants-contractors has installed counting systems on a wide range of Irish salmon and sea trout rivers.</P>
        <P>Considerable capital expenditure has been invested in the counter programme over the past number of years and I expect the regional fisheries boards and the Marine Institute to collaborate closely in managing the fish counter programme in the most effective and efficient way possible. I am sure that the Deputy will be aware of the increased importance of counters in view of the impending changes in the commercial fishery.</P>
        <P>It was decided in June 2003 that the management of all existing counters be transferred to the relevant regional fisheries boards. It is my view that the service can be operated most efficiently and economically by trained fisheries board staff on the ground and I would regard this as an integral part of each board&rsquo;s functions. It should be possible for both the Marine Institute and the fisheries boards to operate the existing counter programme in an efficient manner within the <Col N="1349"/>existing financial resources available to them. It is a matter for each board to decide its priorities in relation to investment in counters within their overall allocation of Exchequer funding for capital and current expenditure purposes. In 2005 the Southern Regional Fisheries Board received Exchequer funding of &euro;2,509,300 and for 2006 the allocation is &euro;2,158.505.</P>
        <P>The Department is reviewing the arrangements in respect of the operational, data management and quality assurance issues for the national fish counter management programme. I expect this review to be completed shortly so that an enhanced national management programme will be established within the available resources to be carried out by the regional fisheries boards in partnership with the Marine Institute.</P>

I am advised by the chief executive of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board that this weir presents difficulties occasionally for salmon passing up the River Suir at low water levels during the spawning season. The board, in conjunction with the engineering division of the Department, presented a temporary remedy to the owners of the weir. However, following consultation with the OPW, the initial plan was rejected because of the impact on the adjacent bridge during flood conditions. I understand that a further temporary solution has now been agreed and will be completed this summer. Furthermore, I am advised that to address the problems of flooding, the OPW has planned a flood relief scheme for Clonmel, and as part of this scheme, the OPW has agreed to install a comprehensive fish pass system, which will be drawn up by the engineering division of the Department </P>

        <P>In its submission, the Commission states that regional trade agreements &mdash; which include the economic partnership agreements, EPAs, under negotiation between the EU and the ACP states &mdash; should support the development efforts of developing countries and promote their participation in world trade. In the Commission&rsquo;s view, the negotiations on regional trade agreements should take account of individual countries&rsquo; level of development and should clarify the scope for special and differential treatment for developing countries on issues such as the length of the transition period, the exclusion of sensitive products, and the degree of reciprocity between the parties in the elimination of duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I remain gravely concerned at the long-running conflict and related humanitarian crisis in northern Uganda, which has led to the deaths of many thousands of people and the displacement of over 1.5 million. It clearly merits increased international attention. Ireland, in collaboration with our EU partners, has been actively working to achieve this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The primary responsibility for improving security and promoting reconciliation in northern Uganda rests with the Ugandan Government. Following the presidential and parliamentary elections last February, a window of opportunity now exists for the Ugandan authorities to take decisive steps to tackle the conflict. These should include improving security to facilitate greater humanitarian access and measures to promote the much needed economic and social development of northern Uganda. A positive development in this regard is the long-term reconstruction and development plan for northern Uganda which the Ugandan Government outlined at a donors&rsquo; meeting in Geneva on 20 March 2006. This comprehensive plan emphasises conflict resolution and reconciliation, as well as reconstruction and development. The UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Coordination, Mr. Jan Egeland, visited Kampala on 30-31 March 2006 to discuss these proposals with the Ugandan Government and representatives of the donor community, including Ireland. The Irish Government will continue to work closely with EU and donor partners to promote increased engagement by Uganda with the international community in addressing the conflict in northern Uganda.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The LRA campaign also threatens security in the Great Lakes region as a whole, including in southern Sudan and the eastern DRC from which the LRA continues to operate. At my request, the Irish Permanent Representative to the United <Col N="1352"/>Nations wrote to the President of the UN Security Council last January urging the council to address the threat to regional peace posed by the LRA. The UN Secretary General has been requested, in Security Council Resolutions 1653 and 1663, to submit proposals to the council by 24 April 2006 on how the UN can support efforts to put an end to the activities of illegal armed groups in the Great Lakes region, including the LRA. I look forward to this report, which will be an important contribution to the current intensified efforts to resolve the conflict in northern Uganda. Ireland will continue to encourage greater Security Council involvement, including consideration of proposals to appoint a UN special envoy for northern Uganda and to establish a panel of experts to examine the sources of funding and support for the LRA&rsquo;s campaign.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also important that the indictments issued last October by the International Criminal Court against five named LRA leaders now be acted on. It is incumbent on all those involved, including the governments of any neighbouring states in which these leaders may be sheltering, to facilitate their arrest. Ireland strongly supports the International Criminal Court and would urge that its investigation into all serious violations of human rights committed in northern Uganda since 1 July 2002, the date when the court was established, should continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The overall humanitarian situation in northern Uganda remains alarming, with an estimated 1.7 million people, the vast majority of the population, continuing to live in internally displaced persons camps. However, some limited return of displaced persons to their homes and communities has begun in the Teso region, following an underlying improvement in the security situation, with approximately 390,000 returning in 2005. Irish Aid is continuing to support emergency and recovery efforts and has already provided &euro;1.9 million in humanitarian assistance to northern Uganda in 2006. This funding has been provided to GOAL, UNICEF, and the UN World Food Programme, WFP. Some &euro;1.65 million in humanitarian assistance was provided in 2005. Irish Aid has also supported NGOs in northern Uganda providing shelter to the estimated 40,000 children and young people who are required to flee their homes each night, for fear of possible abduction by the LRA or worse.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government deeply values the extensive range of services that the London Irish Centre in Camden has offered to the Irish community in <Col N="1354"/>London for more than 50 years. In recognition of the centre&rsquo;s vital role within the Irish community, I have been happy to approve significant funding to it from my Department&rsquo;s D&Iacute;ON fund. The Deputy raises the matter of capital funding for the London Irish Centre. In November 2004 I was pleased to extend the eligibility for D&Iacute;ON funding to include capital projects. This was a positive response to the interest within the Irish community in Britain for support towards capital projects, and was a development made possible by the substantial increase in funding that had been secured for emigrant services.</P>
        <P>I, too, am convinced of the need to install a lift in the London Irish Centre. It is for this specific purpose that I included a grant to the centre of &euro;100,000 in the first batch of capital grants I approved in November 2004. I am advised that the structural work to install the lift will begin shortly. As the centre is located in an old building in a congested part of London, the planning, survey and structural reports involved in this project have taken a considerable period of time. Although the Government is the principal donor for this project, I am pleased to note that the centre has also secured other funding from a private charity and the local statutory authority. The trustees expect that the lift will be installed before the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The London Irish Centre in Camden also received significant funding last year when I approved a grant to it of &euro;399,930. This grant supports nine posts at the centre and includes a contribution towards the refurbishment of the day centre where the seniors&rsquo; luncheon club and other activities take place.</P>

However, I am satisfied that the percentage of staff with a disability in the Department of Foreign Affairs is in excess of the 3% target. Our estimate would put the figure at about 3.4%.</P>

	<P>We have always included Private James Wilson of the 4th Canadian Battalion in our efforts to seek pardons for those &ldquo;shot at dawn&rdquo;. The Report into the Courts Martial and Execution of Twenty Six Irish Soldiers by the British Army During World War I which I laid before the Oireachtas last week was prepared primarily on the basis of a thorough evaluation of the courts-martial files made available to us by the British authorities at our request. As Private Wilson&rsquo;s file was held by the Canadian authorities, my Department separately requested a copy of this file through our embassy in Ottawa. Regrettably the file kept in the Canadian archives was incomplete and a number of papers had been removed from it, including the report of his court-martial. It was not possible, therefore, to prepare an accurate summary of the case made against him for inclusion in our report which was submitted to the British Government in October 2004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the report, as submitted to the British Government, includes summaries of individual cases, it is our position that beyond the compelling individual circumstances, there are persuasive grounds for the British Government to grant a retrospective pardon to all those &ldquo;shot at dawn&rdquo;. Contemporary public and parliamentary dissatisfaction with the number and manner of military executions during the First World War was such that the death penalty was repealed for the military offences under which each execution took place by 1930. In addition, there is evidence to suggest a disparity in the treatment of lower ranks in comparison to officers and statistical evidence that highlights a harsher disciplinary regime faced by men from Ireland in comparison to men from other countries. Moreover, there are numerous references to the need for an example to be made when sentencing was being considered.</P><Col N="1356"/>
        <P>I believe that these points, singly or cumulatively, constitute sufficient grounds for pardons to be issued to all 26 Irish soldiers involved, including Private Wilson, and this we will continue to advocate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the provisions of the 2002 Sun City peace accords, the transition process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo &mdash; DRC &mdash; is formally set to conclude at the end of June 2006, with the holding of the first democratic elections in the DRC in more than 40 years. The successful holding of national elections represents a major undertaking which will require substantial international support. The European Union and its member states have made substantial contributions in support of the electoral process, with the European Commission contributing &euro;150 million while Ireland has contributed &euro;500,000. The EU is also likely to deploy an election observation mission, although a final decision on its deployment is still awaited.</P>
        <P>The European Council decided on 24 March that the EU would deploy a mission to provide support to MONUC, the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC, during the upcoming electoral process. Ireland has indicated it will make available up to ten headquarters personnel for the mission, subject to national decision-making procedures.</P>
        <P>Major challenges continue to confront the DRC, as the transition process draws to a close. Greater progress needs to be made in tackling impunity and establishing an effective system of justice. The DRC Government and its armed forces need to continue collaborating closely with MONUC in confronting and removing the threat posed by illegal armed militias in eastern DRC. There also needs to be greater progress in security sector reform, particularly with regard to completing the creation of a fully integrated national army and police and effectively establishing state authority throughout the DRC. The EU is actively supporting the process of security sector reform in the DRC, through deployment of two EU missions, EUPOL and EUSEC. The regional dimension in improving peace and security also remains critical and underlines the importance of initiatives, such as the International Conference on the Great Lakes, which Ireland has supported financially.</P>
        <P>Up to 5 million people have died from the direct or indirect consequences of the conflict in <Col N="1357"/>DRC since 1998. There are more than 1.6 million displaced persons in the country while 80% of the population live below the absolute poverty line. The UN has launched a 2006 action plan for the DRC which calls for &euro;570 million in funding for humanitarian programmes. So far in 2006, Ireland has provided emergency and recovery funding of &euro;4 million to the UN World Food Programme, WFP, UNICEF and UNHCR in response to the UN plan.</P>
        <P>Within Kenya, the major challenge confronting President Kibaki and his Government continues to be that of corruption. Following the publication of the Githongo report in January 2006 which made a series of allegations of high level corruption, two ministers and a personal assistant to President Kibaki were required to resign. Another minister subsequently resigned on account of his implication in a previous corruption scandal. However, to date no prosecutions have resulted from the allegations made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Kibaki Government has made efforts since its election in December 2002 to tackle corruption and to strengthen the legislative and institutional anti-corruption framework. However, further measures, including prosecutions, will be necessary in order to reassure international opinion of the seriousness of the government&rsquo;s intent in tackling corruption. In this regard, the EU has publicly expressed its concern over recent raids on the media in Kenya carried out by security agencies which appear to be an attempt to curb press freedom in commenting on issues of public importance such as corruption.</P>
        <P>Kenya and its neighbouring countries in the Horn of Africa are in the grip of a severe drought affecting up to 11 million people across the region. It is estimated that 5 million people in Kenya alone now require food aid. Ireland responded promptly to this emergency, providing over &euro;5 million in emergency humanitarian funding last February to agencies working in the Horn of Africa. Further funding of &euro;2 million is now being made available to key NGOs and international organisations working in response to the emergency.</P>
        <P>Mozambique continues to be one of Africa&rsquo;s most successful examples of post-conflict reconstruction and development. President Armando Guebuza assumed office in January 2005, following elections in December 2004 which the EU election observation mission deemed to have broadly met international accepted standards. The Guebuza Government has taken steps to tackle the problem of corruption in the public service, police and legal system by establishing a central office for combating corruption. The EU is pursuing an active political dialogue with the government under Article 8 of the Cotonou agreement.</P>
        <P>Mozambique is one of Ireland&rsquo;s six ODA programme countries in Africa, with a bilateral assistance programme amounting to some &euro;29 million in 2006. Ireland is helping Mozambique to reduce <Col N="1358"/>poverty through fostering economic growth, equitable social development and improved democratic governance. In addition, Ireland is committed to providing &euro;40 million over five years &mdash; 2003-07 &mdash; through the Clinton Foundation to support the rapid scaling up of HIV-AIDS care and treatment programmes in Mozambique. In 2005, Irish Aid also provided funding of &euro;1 million to the World Food Programme for emergency food assistance in Mozambique as part of the response to the region-wide food security crisis in southern Africa.</P>

	<P>The most recent information and statistics on the HIV-AIDS epidemic are contained in the annual report, AIDS Epidemic Update 2005, released by the joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS, and the World Health Organisation, WHO. This report noted progress in declining HIV infection rates in a number of countries and increasing access to HIV treatment.</P>
        <P>Adult HIV infection rates have decreased in certain countries and changes in behaviour to prevent infection have played a key part in these declines. In Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe are all showing declines in HIV prevalence. In Kenya, adult infection rates have decreased from a peak of 10% in the late 1990s to 7% in 2003; in Uganda, from more than 15% to 7% today and in Zimbabwe, from 26% in 2002 to 21% in 2004. The UNAIDS report also recognises that access to HIV treatment has improved markedly over the past two years, especially in developing countries. The number of people receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy, ART, for HIV/AIDS has more than doubled from 400,000 in 2003 to approximately 1 million in 2005. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of <Col N="1359"/>people receiving ART has tripled within a period of one year and it now reaches approximately 500,000 people.</P>
        <P>The reality, however, is that the AIDS epidemic continues to outstrip global and national efforts to contain it. The overall number of people living with HIV has continued to increase in all regions of the world except the Caribbean. There were an additional 5 million new infections in 2005, the majority in women. The number of people living with HIV globally has reached its highest level, with more than 40 million people now infected. More than 3 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2005, including more than 500,000 children. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to more than 60% of all people living with HIV.</P>
        <P>In addition to a long-term sustained attack on poverty, a rapid increase in the scale and scope of HIV prevention programmes is urgently needed to stop the speed at which new infections are occurring. This needs to take place in the context of a comprehensive response to HIV and AIDS, which requires the simultaneous acceleration of treatment and prevention efforts with the ultimate goal of universal access to prevention, treatment and care.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a strong commitment to addressing HIV/AIDS. It is a key priority for Irish Aid&rsquo;s policies and programmes. The Taoiseach, in his speech to the United Nations in September 2005, reaffirmed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to HIV/AIDS and announced a new initiative on HIV/AIDS and other global communicable diseases. This will bring funding for these diseases up to &euro;100 million per year. This initiative will focus on tackling the major diseases affecting developing countries, including HIV/AIDS. It will build on Ireland&rsquo;s existing support at international, regional and country level and will afford Ireland a stronger voice in international policy dialogue and advocacy for co-ordinated and effective action on HIV/AIDS.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to work with the international community in advocating for a sustained and resourced global response to HIV/AIDS, strengthened leadership at all levels and improved co-ordination of resources and planning for HIV/AIDS prevention and control.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if his Department has been in contact with the governments of those countries whose citizens are working in Ireland below the recommended levels of pay, as reported here in the media; the nature and outcome of those discussions; if he will ensure there will be no exploitation here of migrant workers from these countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality, as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to other Irish workers. For the avoidance of doubt section 20 of the Protection of Employee&rsquo;s (Part-Time) Work Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to workers posted to work in Ireland in line with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 1996.</P><Col N="1366"/>
        <P>Section 20 of the 2001 Act also provides that all employee protection legislation applies to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Thus all employment rights legislation applies to migrant workers engaged to work in Ireland under a contract of employment. The employment rights compliance section of the Department, which includes the labour inspectorate, applies the same principles in the discharge of its functions and, accordingly, makes no distinction as between Irish and migrant workers when undertaking compliance checking or investigating complaints. Where possible, the inspectorate will investigate any specific matters brought to its attention once they fall within its powers and remit.</P>
        <P>In that regard inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employers are required to maintain records in respect of such employees and these records, together with other substantiating evidence, for example, a statement from an employee, provide the essentials of a basis for legal proceedings. Failure to maintain adequate records by an employer is an offence.</P><Col N="1367"/>
        <P>In the course of investigating matters brought to its attention it is not a normal feature of the inspectorate&rsquo;s approach to initiate contacts with the governments of other states. Where the specific circumstances of a case might suggest that the assistance of an embassy could be useful the inspectorate would make such inquiries. For its part the Government is always ready to listen to the concerns of any state regarding the treatment of its citizens in Ireland.</P>

	<P>Following a review of F&Aacute;S employment schemes &mdash; community employment, job initiative and social economy programmes &mdash; I announced on 10 November 2004 that the three year cap for participants on community employment was being raised to six years for those over 55 years, to ensure the maintenance of essential community services particularly in rural areas, where it had been found that difficulties existed in finding replacement participants. There are already a number of dedicated programmes for youth and community centres being provided by F&Aacute;S. These comprise community training centres, local training initiatives, apprenticeship programmes and so forth.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for grant <Col N="1368"/>assistance to companies is an operational matter for the relevant development agencies; IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the city and county enterprise boards, Intertrade Ireland and Shannon Development. As part of their due diligence concerning applications for grants, agencies seek to ensure that clients operate to best practice standards in all aspects of their operations. It is not a condition of receiving grant assistance that companies demonstrate previous compliance with employment law. However, the development agencies require companies to which they provide grant assistance to ensure that all actions undertaken in relation to funded activities comply with relevant regulations and legislation during the period of the funding including, as appropriate, employment law.</P>

	<P Just="Left">EU Directive 2003/18/EC amends the existing Council Directive 83/477/EEC as amended on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work. The existing directive as amended is fully implemented and enforced in Ireland. So, too, is the directive concerning the marketing and use of asbestos, which means that there is a ban on the marketing and use of asbestos in general. The existing directives provide for some derogations for specific uses for a specific period of time. EU Directive 2003/18/EC aims to regulate the activities around those derogations in setting stricter rules protecting workers who carry out those activities.</P>
        <P>EU Directive 2003/18/EC provides that member states should comply with the directive by 15 April 2006. I am advised that legislative proposals are currently being drafted by the Health and Safety Authority. I have yet to receive these legislative proposals, so the directive will not be implemented in Ireland by 15 April 2006.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the Health and Safety Authority has been working with other member states and the EU Commission in drawing up new guidelines for enforcement and implementation of EU Directive 2003/18/EC. I expect that this preparation should have a positive effect on the enforcement of the regulatory measures to be put in place in Ireland.</P>

	<P>Most of the specific measures required to implement Directive 2004/48/EC on the enforcement of intellectual property rights already exist in Irish law but a small number require primary legislation. The proposed Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is intended to transpose several EU directives, will include the further provisions needed to complete legal transposition in this case. My Department is working actively with Parliamentary Counsel on drafting that Bill with a view to its publication in the coming months and consideration by the Oireachtas before the end of 2006.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314, 316 and 317 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the percentage of workers who reported suffering from work related stress in 2005 and each of the preceding five years, figures obtained from the Health and Safety Authority from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, as set out in Table 1, illness category by gender, indicate that 12,200 respondents in the quarterly national household survey, QNHS, of the CSO reported stress, depression or anxiety illnesses for 2004 at a rate of six per 1,000 workers. Of these, 5,300 were males, a rate of five per 1,000 workers, and 6,800 are females, a rate of eight per 1,000 workers. Figures for 2005 are not yet available and there are no corresponding data available for preceding years.</P><Col N="1378"/>
        <P>With regard to work related deaths, the Health and Safety Authority has provided figures on the number of reported work-related fatalities for past five years, which are set out in Table 2. The fatalities are compared with information supplied by the CSO in regard to those aged 15+ in employment for each of the years. The work-related fatality rate per 100,000 persons employed is also shown in the table. I understand that the authority does not have information on the rate of work-related deaths as a percentage of all deaths in the population in any year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to work-related ill health, the Central Statistics Office, in accordance with data obtained through its quarterly national household survey, has provided the Health and Safety Authority with estimates of work-related ill health in the period 2001 to 2004. This information is set out in Table 3. Data for 2005 were collected in the first quarter of 2006 and are not yet available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will appreciate that the questions relate to areas wider than those covered in my range of responsibilities as Minister with responsibility for occupational health and safety and perhaps the Central Statistics Office website, <i>www.cso.ie</i> which contains a wide range of information under a variety of headings including labour market and people and population, would also be of assistance.</P><Col N="1377"/>

	<P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments under Sustaining Progress, in June 2005 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment issued a White Paper on the review of the Employment Agency Act 1971. The deadline for submissions was 15 July 2005. The Department is currently finalising the heads of a Bill based on submissions received. This process should be completed by the end of June 2006 and includes consultations with the various interests. Government approval will then be sought to have a Bill drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It is hoped to publish this Bill in the second half of 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Matters under consideration for inclusion in the Bill include providing for a system of registration of employment agencies based in Ireland, supported by an industry regulatory code which will set out in detail the practices and standards that employment agencies would be expected to follow. Another change is that a statutory monitoring and advisory committee, representative of all the various interests in the sector, will be established. This committee will oversee the regulatory code and make recommendations to the Minister of State with responsibility for  labour affairs with regard to revoking or suspending registration and the prosecution of employment agencies which breach the code. However, it will be necessary to take account of the potential impact of revised proposals from the European Commission on the draft EU services directive, expected in April 2006 and the free movement of persons, services and capital within the EU, as laid down in the EU Treaty.</P>

        <P>In addition, my Department is to participate in the willing able mentoring project this summer. This project, which is administered by the Association of Higher Education Access and Disability, aims to provide graduates with disabilities with temporary placements with public and private sector employers.</P>
        <P>The policy with regard to the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance. However, it may be of interest to note that independent research was carried out into the operation of the 3% target by consultants commissioned by the Department of Finance. The research found, <i>inter alia</i>, that 7% of Civil Service staff had a disability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On foot of the consultants&rsquo; recommendations, the Government approved proposals to improve the operation of the policy. These proposals included the development of a new, detailed code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities, a more effective approach to monitoring staff with a disability, a new approach to recruitment and placement and the appointment of a full-time disability advisory officer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions 323 and 324 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been party to the European Patent Convention since 1992 and our law reflects its Article 52 criteria on the patentability of inventions. The convention makes it clear that computer programmes, as such, cannot be patented but it is important to note that this does not extend to so-called &ldquo;computer implemented inventions&rdquo;. These are patentable in certain circumstances and many thousands of such patents have already been granted by the European Patent Office and apply within the EU. The revision of the convention does not change the patentability criteria with regard to these inventions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Commission proposal for a Council regulation on a Community patent in August 2000 envisaged Community patents being granted by the European Patent Office and that the EU would itself accede to the European Patent Convention. All EU member states, except Malta, are already contracting states. The Community patent would, in effect, be a European patent designating the Community but, unlike European patents, it would be unitary in character and relate to the entirety of the Community. The intention was that this would co-exist with the national and European patent systems already in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the EU competitiveness council unanimously agreed on a common political approach on the Community patent in March 2003, progress on this has since been deadlocked on issues to do with translations and no breakthrough is in sight. Against this background, the Commission sought views this January from industry and other stakeholders on how best to take account of stakeholders&rsquo; needs in patent policy. The proposal for a Community patent remains a priority, but the Commission is also seeking views on what other measures could be taken in the near future to improve the patent system in Europe.</P>
        <P>In 2002 the European Commission proposed a directive to harmonise the conditions for patenting computer-implemented inventions. It was concerned that practice on granting such patents varied between EU member states and that particular inventions could get protection in one member state but not in another. Ireland supported the proposal as offering increased certainty on intellectual property right protection and as reinforcing the single EU internal market. While the measure had wide support from the European information and communications technology industry, including the small and medium-sized enterprises sector, in the event, the European Parliament opposed it. The current situation is that the European Commission has indicated that it does not intend to pursue proposals for a directive in this area.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive, mid-western region, has advised that payment to the person concerned has been suspended since the end of February 2006 due to an increase in household means. The community welfare officer is currently reviewing the claim. The person concerned has been requested to provide additional details of his exceptional heating needs. When the necessary information is supplied, the executive will determine whether he still has an entitlement to the heating supplement and notify him accordingly.</P>

        <P>A deciding officer disallowed the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned from 21 February 2006 on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking employment. Consequently, he does not qualify for credited contributions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The bereavement grant, which is a payment based on PRSI contributions, is designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. The grant is payable on the death of an insured person or a family member, including a child under 18 years, or under 22 years if in full-time education. In the case of persons over these ages, the grant is paid on the basis of their own PRSI contributions.</P>
        <P>If the person applying for the bereavement grant was previously insurable employed in another country covered by EU regulations and has paid at least one full-rate PRSI contribution since returning to Ireland, the person may combine his or her insurance record from the EU country with his or her Irish insurance record to help qualify for the grant. The person applying for the grant may also use periods of insurance or residence in countries with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement to qualify for the grant. Once a person satisfies the PRSI conditions, he or she is entitled to the grant even if he or she lives outside Ireland.</P>
        <P>Where there are insufficient PRSI contributions, a person may receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Under this arrangement, the Health Service Executive may make a single payment to help meet exceptional expenditure, for example, for funeral expenses, which a family could not reasonably be expected to meet out of its income.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 328 and 329 together.</P>
        <P>The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties <Col N="1386"/>are protected by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, introduced from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, have a minimum of 260 paid contributions and achieve a yearly average of at least ten contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The social welfare system comprises two types of pension; contributory pensions based on social insurance contributions and non-contributory pensions, payment of which is subject to a means test. Within that basic structure, the Government is anxious to ensure as many people as possible can qualify for pensions in their own right.</P>
        <P>In recent years, several measures have been introduced making it easier for people to qualify for contributory pensions. These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to ten and the introduction of special half rate pensions based on pre-1953 insurance contributions. <i>Pro rata</i> pensions are also available to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment. This set of measures is of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home.</P>
        <P>There are those who will not benefit from the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme and who cannot qualify for a pension in their own right. In this regard, the Government is committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults, aged 66 years or over, to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension and to facilitate the direct payment of the allowance to spouses and partners.</P>
        <P>In budget 2006, I made changes to the income disregards allowed under the means test for the non-contributory pension. The basic income disregard was increased by &euro;12.40 per week to &euro;20. I also introduced an earnings disregard of &euro;100 per week. These allowances are doubled in the case of couples and will allow more people to qualify for social welfare pensions.</P>
        <P>I continue to look for ways in the current social welfare structure in which the needs of older people who are outside the social welfare pensions system may be addressed further.</P>

	<P>The policy of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is to ensure cost-effective arrangements for making payments through a range of payment options and that the service is continually adapted by providing access to new payment services and facilities as they become available. Customers opt for a particular payment method having regard to their personal preferences.</P>
        <P>The range of payment options offered by the Department include payment at post offices by means of a pension order book and by electronic or manual post draft, issued to the customer&rsquo;s designated post office each week. Payments are also made by cheque to the home address of the customer and direct payment to the customer&rsquo;s bank or building society account. Some 56% of customers have chosen to receive payment through their local post office, 9% are paid by cheque through the postal system and 35% have chosen to receive direct electronic payment to their bank or building society account.</P>
        <P>Last year I announced a review of the Department&rsquo;s payment methods. The review will consider all current payment options and it will identify solutions to ensure high-quality payment delivery services for the future.</P>

	<P>The person in question, who is a participant in the back to education allowance scheme, contacted the Department of Social and Family Affairs regarding the recent High Court decision on the subject of discontinuation of summer payment. He also inquired about the reinstatement of postgraduate courses of education under the scheme. Correspondence was received on 14 March and a reply issued to him on 27 March 2006.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce. Following a review of the basic purpose underlying the Department&rsquo;s back to education provisions, the scheme was revised.</P>
        <P>In framing proposals to change elements of the scheme the concern was to ensure resources should be focused where the need is greatest. In line with this, payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued for the scheme&rsquo;s participants as many students traditionally find seasonal work at home or abroad during the summer months. Participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to an unemployment payment, <Col N="1390"/>subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions.</P>
        <P>The issue was recently the subject of a High Court case concerning the cessation of back to education payments during the summer of 2003. I am considering the implications of the judgment and have sought advice from the Attorney General. I will consider the matter further in the light of that advice.</P>
        <P>The recent High Court decision deals only with the discontinuation of summer payments to the scheme&rsquo;s participants. Regarding changes to the scheme as it relates to postgraduate courses of education, I am satisfied people in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a good level of academic attainment, which should impact positively on their employment prospects. I should add, that the scheme continues to support those wishing to take up a higher diploma in any disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school-teaching.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Budget 2006 contained several important measures designed to target resources at particular groups of older people, including farmers. In considering these measures I was anxious to target resources at those at the greatest risk of poverty, to encourage saving and to simplify the system of income support for older people who do not receive contributory pensions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One key measure I was pleased to announce on budget day was the establishment from next September of a single standardised pension scheme with a greatly enhanced means-testing regime. The State pension, non-contributory, will replace the old age pension and, for recipients aged 66 years and over, blind pension, widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pension, one parent family payment, deserted wife&rsquo;s allowance and prisoner&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All schemes in question feature a common means disregard of &euro;7.60 per week, which has not increased since the 1970s. The means disregard for the new non-contributory pension will be &euro;20 per week, an increase of &euro;12.40 per week. More than 30,000 pensioners who are in receipt of a reduced rate of payment will gain from this change with increases of up to &euro;12.50 per week in the personal rate of payment and increases in the qualified adult rate, where applicable, of up to &euro;8.30 per week. I should point out that these increases will be in addition to the increase of &euro;16 per week in the rate of old age non-contributory pension which took effect from January. Furthermore, the new State pension, non-contributory, will also feature an innovative disregard of &euro;100 <Col N="1391"/>per week in respect of earnings from employment. These measures will benefit those farmers who are in receipt of an old age, non-contributory, pension, as well as entitling some to a means-tested pension for the first time.</P>
        <P>Consequent on the increase in the means disregard to &euro;20 per week, a single person, with no other means, will be able to have up to &euro;35,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.</P>
        <P>The levels of increases and revised means test arrangements announced in the budget are exceptional. The proposed modernisation of the arrangements is also a further demonstration of our commitment to the elderly, including farmers.</P>
        <P>I will continue to keep the current arrangements under review, particularly in the context of framing future budget proposals.</P>

It is also available to people under 66 years in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.</P>
        <P>People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months are also eligible for free travel.</P>

	<P>Shannon Foynes Port is a State-owned company established under the Harbours Act 1996. The Act provides that the principal objects of the company include the provision of such facilities, services and lands in its harbour for ships, goods and passengers as it considers necessary. The company is required to take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of its harbour. Decisions regarding the use of the land within the port estate are a matter for the port company.</P>
        <P>On 15 March last, the Shannon Foynes Port Company announced that it was conducting a strategic review of its property portfolio, which could result in a major expansion and upgrade of its facilities in the Shannon estuary at a cost of over &euro;100 million. The company manages six different port installations in the Shannon estuary, three of which are wholly owned.</P>
        <P>The company projects significant increases in its volume of trade over the coming years and investment in new modern facilities that can handle bigger ships is required to accommodate this growth in trade. Continued investment in port infrastructure has been identified as being critical for the future development of the mid-west region. Whatever the conclusions of this review, the company has said it will continue to work in partnership with other stakeholders in the region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More generally, a process is under way in my Department to examine future port capacity requirements at a national level, particularly for unitised trade. The ports have been invited by advisers working for the Department to make detailed project submissions regarding their development plans. These submissions have recently been received, including one from the Shannon Foynes Port Company, and are currently being evaluated.</P>
        <P>It is intended to finalise a report over the coming months. The purpose of this process is to provide reassurance to Government that the anticipated capacity requirement for our growing economy will be met through the successful advancement and implementation by the port sector of some combination of the various proposals currently under development in the sector.</P>
        <P>As for the implications of future port developments on road traffic in the region, the transfer <Col N="1394"/>of responsibility for ports and maritime transport to my Department certainly facilitates better integration of maritime and road transport policy. The implications for traffic congestion of any new port developments represent one of the criteria that will be looked at as part of the evaluation of the submissions referred to above.</P>

	<P>My officials have made inquiries in this case and I understand that the matter is currently under investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot have a role in operational matters where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved.</P>
        <P>It is necessary for the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, to ascertain that it has a liability in this case. Matters are being expedited as quickly as possible and once liability has been established, I would expect that compensation could be paid soon after.</P>
        <P>In all motor collisions referred to the MIBI, the innocent victim will be compensated for personal injuries and, where the driver is identified as being uninsured, for property damage. The MIBI will reimburse the innocent victim for losses incurred, including out of pocket expenses subject to the excess in the agreement, including interest incurred as a result of borrowing to fund outlays.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that a representative of the MIBI met the claimant, who is the subject of the question, on Monday, 3 April. I am sure the Deputy will understand that the MIBI must ensure that claims fall within the scope of the agreement and that liability has been established against the uninsured or untraced driver. It is important to establish the insurance position of the offending vehicle before a payment is made. Where the driver is identified, MIBI representatives will interview him or her and take a statement. Where the offending driver is unidentified, the MIBI must rely on the Garda investigation for verification of the circumstances of the accident, identification of the offending driver and the insurance status of the vehicle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this case, I understand that the MIBI has been in touch with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it hopes to be in a position to complete its assessment of the case over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The MIBI&rsquo;s role is to compensate victims of uninsured and untraced drivers. Membership of the MIBI is required of all motor insurers writing insurance in the State under section 78 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as inserted by S.I. No. 347 of 1992. There have been a number of agreements between the MIBI &mdash; which is a company <Col N="1395"/>under the Companies Acts limited by guarantee and without share capital &mdash; and first, in 1955, with the Minister for Local Government, then Environment and later, in 2004, with the Minister for Transport. The MIBI was deemed the insurer of last resort/compensation body under the second EU motor insurance directive, 84/5/EEC.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have previously indicated, the delay in providing driving tests is a matter of regret to me. It is also hampering the development of initiatives that I wish to pursue and which will contribute further to road safety. The driving test and those who deliver it are a key element in the road safety strategy.</P>
        <P>It is my objective to eliminate the backlog of driving tests by mid-2007 and my Department has developed a package of measures in consultation with staff interests to achieve this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Additional staff have been made available to the driving test service. Seven additional testers are at present being trained and will be carrying out tests from April onwards. A recruitment campaign has been completed and a further ten persons will commence training shortly and will be available for testing this June.</P>
        <P>In addition, a high number of the existing driver testers have indicated that they will participate in a bonus scheme that will make a significant contribution to the reduction of the backlog. Some 90 driver testers have, by way of additional Saturday and evening working, committed to deliver some 30,000 tests over a one-year period. This scheme commenced in February and will make a significant contribution to the backlog.</P>
        <P>As regards outsourcing, the Civil Service Arbitration Board has determined that, otherwise than by agreement, the contracting out of core work of driver testers to a private firm is not contemplated or permitted by the provisions of para<Col N="1396"/>graph 21.9 or by any other provision of Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>However, the board urged a resumption of discussions at which all options &mdash; and it emphasised all options &mdash; should be considered, with a view to ensuring that a solution is implemented without delay. I am currently in discussions with the unions on a way forward with a view to dealing with the backlog by the middle of 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department made inquiries into this matter and has been informed by Fingal County Council that the area in question is the airport spur of the M1 &mdash; that section of the M1 between the airport roundabout and the M1 airport interchange. This includes the approach ramp between the airport and the slip road heading northwards on the M1.</P>
        <P>The speed limit on this section of road is 60 km/h. This speed limit was originally introduced as a special speed limit of 40 mph in the Road Traffic (Speed Limits) (County of Fingal) By-Laws 2002 and was converted to the metric equivalent of 60 km/h under section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, with effect from 20 January 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The council indicates that the main reason for having a 60 km/h speed limit at this location is to allow for the large volume of weaving traffic to lane-change safely over the relatively short distance of 500 m along the area in question. The area has been examined by the council&rsquo;s traffic engineers who are satisfied that the speed limit is properly and adequately signed at the start and end of the 60 km/h zone.</P>
        <P>The county council has informed me that the special speed limit zone in question is clearly sign-posted on both the approach from the airport and the approach from the old N1 by the Coachman&rsquo;s Inn. The council has indicated that it proposes to <Col N="1398"/>put additional signage &mdash; speed limit repeater signs &mdash; in place to emphasise the existence of the 60 km/h special speed limit zone.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of offences under the Road Traffic Acts, generally, is the responsibility of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The application of penalty points is a matter for the Garda or the courts.</P>

	<P>This matter has been raised in the House before and I indicated that open skies will be good for Irish tourism, aviation, business links and the economy generally. Open skies will give Irish airlines access to every city in the US, and enable them to negotiate with different airports to obtain the best commercial deals for new services. The additional access to the US as well as the increased numbers of US tourists into Ireland will greatly benefit Irish tourism, aviation and business links generally in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>A number of recent reports including the Brattle report for the European Commission, the report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism, and the Air Transport Users Council, ATUC, of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland report into open skies all support moving to open skies with the US, and emphasise the significant benefits to Ireland when this happens.</P>
        <P>Irish airlines serve four US cities under the existing Ireland-US bilateral arrangement. Expanding services across the Atlantic is of great importance to the growth of Irish airlines and Irish tourism. Irish airports will also benefit from open skies, as the pent-up demand for services to Ireland will open up, and all Irish airports, under open skies, can compete for that business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am fully conscious of the concerns of those living and working in the Shannon region about the impact of any new arrangements. I stated from the beginning that I supported open skies, but that support was contingent on a suitable transitional arrangement for Shannon Airport. Shannon could have faced a sudden and early end to the Shannon stop arrangements without a suitable lead in time to open skies to allow the airport to prepare. Accordingly, I met the US Secretary for Transportation, Norman Mineta, on 9 November 2005 and we agreed on a transitional <Col N="1402"/>arrangement, which will be folded into any EU-US agreement. Ireland is the only EU country to secure transitional arrangements in the proposed EU-US agreement.</P>
        <P>In addition to the extra time the transition arrangements will give Shannon to prepare for open skies, the Government&rsquo;s recently approved &euro;34 billion transport investment plan, known as Transport 21, will greatly enhance the infrastructure of the Shannon region and broaden the catchment area of the airport through the completion of the Dublin to Limerick motorway and the building of the Atlantic road corridor, both of which will link to Shannon Airport, and the re-opening of the western rail corridor. A feasibility study of a Shannon rail link will examine linking Shannon Airport to both Limerick and Galway cities by rail.</P>
        <P>I sought and obtained assurances from Aer Lingus that, in the context of a level playing field between the airline and its competitors, it will maintain the current level of transatlantic traffic, approximately 400,000 passengers a year, with regular year round scheduled services between Shannon and Boston and New York.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In announcing the agreement reached with the US authorities last November on a transitional arrangement for Shannon Airport in the context of the proposed EU-US open skies, I gave an undertaking to prepare, in consultation with my colleagues, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, a tourism and economic development plan for Shannon and the west of Ireland. Accordingly, and in view of the benefits I have outlined, it is not necessary to carry out an impact study. Furthermore, I can see no reason companies in the mid-west area might be forced to relocate as a result of open skies in view of the benefits which will accrue.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Road Collision Facts reports do not provide a breakdown of the number of road users killed in traffic collisions who were working at the time of the collision. The statistics on the number of persons killed in each county from 2000 to 2004 are available in Road Collision Facts 2004 at <i>www.nra.ie</i>. Those reports also contain details of collision rates per thousand population, per thousand registered vehicles and per 10 million vehicle-kilometres of travel for each county. Statistics relating to 2005 are not yet fully analysed or authenticated.</P>
        <P>The statistics do not in general indicate greater problems in the Border regions. The counties which have shown the highest number of collisions per population, the highest number of collisions per 1,000 registered vehicles, and the highest number of collisions per 10 million vehicle kilometres of travel, from 2000 to 2004, include Cavan, Longford, Louth, Cork, Leitrim, Waterford, Carlow and Dublin.</P>

	<P>A total of 12 driver testers are assigned to the Cork region, covering nine driving test centres, including Mallow. The level of service at this test centre is generally consistent with service levels in other centres. The allocation of driver testers to test centres is kept under review having regard to the demand for tests. Occasionally, for operational <Col N="1404"/>reasons, some test centres may not have a driver tester assigned during a particular period. However, three testers are assigned on a regular basis to Mallow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 20 January 2005 the default speed limit on a motorway is 120 km/h. In the Road Traffic (Ordinary Speed Limits &mdash; Certain Vehicles) Regulations 2005, SI 9 of 2005, I prescribed the maximum ordinary speed limit at which specified classes of vehicles can be driven on any public road except where a lower maximum road speed limit applies.</P>
        <P>With effect from 20 January 2005 a speed limit of 80 km/h applies to a vehicle that accommodates more than eight passengers excluding the driver, such as buses, coaches and minibuses, a goods vehicle with a design gross weight exceeding 3,500 kgs and any vehicle towing a trailer, caravan or horse box. A maximum ordinary speed limit of 65 km/h applies to a double deck bus.</P>
        <P>These maximum ordinary speed limits apply to those categories of vehicles on all classes of public road, including motorways, except where the speed limit on a particular road is lower than the 80 km/h or 65 km/h referred to. Vehicle related maximum speed limits, known in law as ordinary speed limits, have been a feature in road traffic legislation since 1961. It has always been the policy to only provide speed limit signs on public roads that indicate the maximum road speed limit. Separate speed limit signs for vehicle related ordinary speed limits are not provided on any class of public road.</P><Col N="1405"/>
        <P>Since 1961 the users of the classes of vehicles that are subject to ordinary speed limits are obliged to be aware of the speed limit that applies to the vehicle being driven. The public information on the <i>www.gometric.ie</i> website, live since January 2005, contains information on the current metric vehicle related speed limits.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to encourage <Col N="1407"/>and assist the community&rsquo;s support for older people by means of a community-based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>To apply for assistance, individuals should contact a local voluntary and community group and request that they make an application on their behalf to the Department. A list of approved participating groups in 2004 is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides maximum individual grants of &euro;300 in respect of the once-off installation cost of socially monitored alarms, &euro;150 in respect of door locks, window locks and door chains, &euro;150 in respect of security lighting, and in 2004 I introduced a grant of &euro;50 in respect of smoke alarms. Funding is not available for conventional intruder alarms under this scheme.</P>
        <P>In response to suggestions from older people and their representatives, the 2005 scheme was announced earlier than in recent years. Advertisements were placed in the national and provincial newspapers in the week beginning 11 April. The closing date for applications under the scheme was 24 May 2005.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 368, 369 and 371 to 375, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my presentation on volunteers and volunteering to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sports, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on 2 March 2005. During the course of that presentation, which was in response to the committee&rsquo;s report on this topic, I provided details of a package of measures to promote, develop and sustain volunteering while a long-term policy and strategy can be developed in consultation with players across the sector.</P>
        <P>The measures include developing and expanding volunteering infrastructure at local and community level, promoting volunteering among young people in second and third level, supporting the development of an authoritative code of best practice for volunteering and developing reliable data with regard to volunteering to inform further initiatives. As I indicated in the course of my presentation to the committee, the key principle underpinning my approach is that volunteering finds meaning and expression at local level and that supports and funding should to the greatest extent seek to reflect and respect this reality.</P>
        <P>The specific question of developing a volunteering passport will be addressed in the context of developing a long-term strategy for volunteering. Considerable, useful up-to-date information on volunteering already exists at local or bureau level. This was one of the functions assigned to the development officer recruited by Volunteer Centres Ireland in 2005 as part of the funding measures I have mentioned. I understand that Volunteer Centres Ireland has developed a database system in use by all of the member centres, which can produce local and national volunteer statistics. The development officer is also encouraging organisations to create the proper structures for the attraction and retention of volunteers and is developing a tool kit manual on establishing a volunteer centre for use by existing, emerging and new volunteer centres, which is based on international and national best practice.</P>

	<P>Under the early retirement scheme, participants who entered the scheme in joint management with their spouses can be paid the early retirement pension only as a supplement to any national retirement pension they or their spouses receive. On entering the scheme, participants are made aware of this requirement and the onus is primarily on them to notify my Department when they, or their spouses, become entitled to national retirement pensions. My Department reminds participants annually of this obligation.</P>
        <P>This control is supplemented by information provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, that Department will not necessarily be aware in every case that a person who becomes entitled to a national retirement pension, or his or her spouse, is also a participant in the early retirement scheme. Therefore, it cannot automatically notify my Department of pensions granted. Given data protection and privacy concerns, officials of my Department cannot be given direct access to databases held by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to check cases. However, I have had discussions with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs about improving the exchange of information between our two Departments. Arrangements are currently being made between the Departments in relation to early retirement scheme participants and their spouses only in order to give earlier notification of possible deductions to my Department and so reduce the risk of overpayments.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there are cases where overpayments have happened. My Department is <Col N="1411"/>obliged, as a paying agency for European Union funds, to pursue all overpayments. However, my officials make every effort to negotiate manageable repayment terms with the people concerned.</P>

	<P>It is a requirement of the EU Council regulations under which the 1994 and 2000 early retirement schemes were introduced that the early retirement pension can be paid only as a supplement to any national retirement pension to which the participant and his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement is entitled. This means that the value of any such national retirement pension payable must be deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>
        <P>It has been determined in consultation with the European Commission that the following pensions are national retirement pensions: old age contributory pension; old age non-contributory pension; widow-widower&rsquo;s contributory pension at age 66; widow-widower&rsquo;s non-contributory <Col N="1412"/>pension at age 66; retirement pension; invalidity pension; and blind person&rsquo;s pension.</P>
        <P>A national retirement pension may comprise a personal allowance, an adult dependant allowance, child dependant allowances and a living alone allowance. The total amount payable constitutes the national retirement pension as a spouse and children do not have independent entitlement to the pension. Therefore, it is the total amount of the national retirement pension that must be deducted from the early retirement pension and not just the personal rate.</P>
        <P>Other payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs such as disability allowance and disability benefit are not regarded as being national retirement pensions and are, therefore, not deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>

	<P>The single payment scheme was introduced in Ireland in 2005 as part of the new measures agreed in the reform of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy. While member states were free to choose between different models of the single payment scheme, ranging from the historical model to various regional models, the reference period agreed by the Council of Ministers for the establishment of payment entitlements for individual farmers was the years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The entitlements were established based on a farmer&rsquo;s participation in the livestock premia schemes, arable aid scheme, etc., during the reference period. Provision was also made for the application of the principle of <i>force majeure</i> whereby any given farmer, whose circumstances were accepted as <Col N="1413"/>exceptional, could be allowed avail of an earlier reference period &mdash; 1997, 1998 and 1999. The dairy premium was added to the single payment based on a farmer&rsquo;s milk quota held on 31 March 2005. The sugar beet compensation will be incorporated in the single payment in 2006 and will be based on the 2001, 2002 and 2003 reference period.</P>
        <P>The mid-term review proposals were published in early 2003 and contained details of the 2000 to 2002 reference period. If 2003 and subsequent years were included in the reference period, it would have enabled certain participants with a capacity to increase production to maximise their applications under the coupled livestock premia and arable aid schemes during 2003 and 2004 and, therefore, increase the level of their single payment at the expense of other farmers within the limits of the national ceiling provided under the EU regulations.</P>

	<P>The position is that 17,500 farmers submitted applications to the national reserve but over 6,000 farmers applied under two or more categories which means that over 23,000 files have to be processed.

	<P>My Department has statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals. The legislation governing this is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Community (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2000. In addition, there is specific legislation in relation to pigs, calves and laying hens.</P>
        <P>The Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 are the principal statutes governing cruelty to animals in this country. Responsibility for pursuing complaints under that legislation rests with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which, on receipt of such a complaint, has the statutory basis on which to investigate and initiate a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal. Officers of my Department are regularly involved in assisting the garda&iacute; in such cases with regard to breaches of farm animal welfare.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have a role in the monitoring of puppy farms or for the welfare of dogs generally other than in relation to commercial transport which is covered by EU regulation on the transport of live animals and in relation to veterinary certification in the case of export of traded dogs. As mentioned in reply to Question No. 600 of 7 March 2006, a working group was appointed in September 2004 to review the man<Col N="1416"/>agement of dog breeding establishments. That working group was appointed by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

        <Quest>the steps she intends to take to ensure that milk quota ring fencing will remain in place and that the milk industry in the west and north east will not be deprived of essential milk supply; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The term &ldquo;ring fencing&rdquo; can be used in the milk quota context to describe two different sets of rules. The first relates to the movement of quota from a less-favoured area, LFA, arising from the transfer of dairying lands and the second concerns the distribution of milk in milk quota restructuring schemes.</P>
        <P>Where land in an LFA to which quota attaches is transferred by way of sale, lease, gift or inheritance, only milk produced on the transferred farm or on other lands within 48 km of it can be delivered in respect of that quota, that is, the new quota holder cannot use the quota on lands more <Col N="1419"/>than 48 km away from the original holding. An exemption is available to a producer who sells his or her entire holding and buys a new holding more than 48 km away.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;ring fencing&rdquo; has also been used in the context of the restructuring scheme. This scheme is operated at co-operative level according to detailed rules set each year by my Department. A primary condition of the scheme is that quota sold into the restructuring pool by a co-operative&rsquo;s suppliers is available for purchase by that co-operative&rsquo;s suppliers in the first instance. Surplus quota in a co-operative&rsquo;s restructuring pool would be distributed on a national basis.</P>
        <P>I recently announced my intention to move to a more open market system for transferring milk quotas, which will come into effect on 1 April 2007. I made this decision because the current restructuring model will not meet the future needs of the industry and a more effective response is required in order to meet future competitive pressures. In making my announcement I made it clear that the new system would continue to operate at co-operative level. Intensive consultation with farming organisations and with the industry has already begun in relation to the detailed arrangements to give effect to this new approach.</P>

	<P>Irish beef exports in 2005 stood at 487,000 tonnes. All of these exports went to the UK and continental Europe except for 35,000 tonnes that went to third countries, mainly Russia. While the beef industry has in recent years become less reliant on third countries, these markets are important for specific cuts at particular times of the year. Third country beef exports attract export refunds.</P>
        <P>At the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 20 March, Commissioner Fischer Boel announced her intention of abolishing pre-financing of export refunds on the basis of criticisms levelled at the system in a 2003 report of the Court of Auditors. The report stated that controls were complex and not evenly applied across member states. The pre-financing regime allows for payment of refunds at the time the beef is put under customs control and for the meat to remain in storage for up to four months. The regime is of benefit to exporters in that it assists them with cash flow but also provides time for the exporter to build up an exportable quantity of stock and to find a suitable market.</P>
        <P>At the meeting of the Council of Ministers, I strongly opposed the removal of pre-financing arguing that its abolition was not justified. Pre-financing is currently being used by most of our exporters of beef to third countries and is an important part of their operation. The system was streamlined in 2003 and the controls are now working well.</P>
        <P>An internal impact study by the Commission shows that the main advantage of the scheme was in the administration of beef exports rather than the financial element. The Commission proposes new beef control measures to replace the present scheme and I and my Department will be examining the proposals to ensure as far as possible that whatever is put in place by the Commission to replace the existing system best suits the needs of the Irish beef sector.</P>

	<P>My Department has statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals. The legislation governing this is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984, and the European Community (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2000. In addition, there is specific legislation in relation to pigs, calves and laying hens.</P>
        <P>The Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 are the principal statutes governing cruelty to animals in this country. Responsibility for pursuing complaints under that legislation rests with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which on receipt of such a complaint has the statutory basis on which to investigate and initiate a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal. Officers of my Department are regularly involved in assisting the Garda in such cases where farmed animals are involved and in that regard I am satisfied that the legislation is adequate.</P>
        <P>I do not have responsibility for the protection and welfare of non-farm animals such as cats which do not come under the definition of farmed animals.</P>
        <P>Although it does not have statutory responsibility in this area, my Department makes <i>ex gratia</i> payments annually to organisations involved in the direct delivery of animal care and welfare <Col N="1422"/>services to assist in their ongoing work. In December last, some &euro;1.2 million was paid to 86 organisations to assist them during 2006. A provision of &euro;1.1 million for this purpose is included in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2006 towards their costs in 2007.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Garda national drugs unit and local drugs units conduct intelligence-driven operations to target individuals suspected of involvement in the distribution of drugs. Drug units and community policing personnel are engaged in intelligence gathering on individuals and groups suspected of involvement in the sale and distribution of all drugs. There is also targeted patrolling by uniform and plain-clothes personnel of problem areas in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in such activity. There is a divisional drugs unit based in Clonmel which is staffed by seven garda&iacute;, of all ranks. The number is augmented as particular demands require and at present includes an additional two members. All garda&iacute; have responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, to deal with drug related issues as they arise.</P>
        <P>Garda management states that they will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Tipperary division with a view to ensuring an effective Garda service is maintained. Garda management further states that the projected financial resources required to operate the Tipperary division for 2006 is adequately provided for in this year&rsquo;s Garda budget of over &euro;1.3 billion. It is a matter for local Garda management to identify and evaluate spec<Col N="1425"/>ific operational needs, and assign resources to meet operational requirements.</P>
        <P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Tipperary division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and other specialised units.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel throughout and within divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of such resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that a further three garda&iacute; are due to be allocated to the Mayo division on 18 April 2006. Garda management states that it is also anticipated that a further two sergeants will be allocated to the Mayo division in conjunction with the next allocation of newly promoted personnel. The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in <Col N="1428"/>training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Mayo division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P>Under Irish law, gaming and gambling is illegal, except where it is specifically permitted under the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act. Certain gaming activities, such as those carried out in casinos, are prohibited. There are no provisions under current legislation for the registration of casinos in this country. However, a number of private clubs offering casino facilities are under investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to establishing whether they are in breach of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.</P>
        <P>It is not appropriate for me to offer a legal opinion in response to a parliamentary question as to the manner in which the law applies in particular circumstances. However, I have concerns about the enforceability of the present law as it applies to casino-type operations in the State and am preparing proposals for submission to Government regarding possible changes in the law that would facilitate the prosecution of offences and the closing down of establishments engaged in such operations. It is my intention, subject to Government approval, to bring forward any such changes, with the forthcoming Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill as the legislative vehicle, to ensure their early enactment.</P>

This represents an increase of 1,743, 16.3%, in the personnel strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during that period.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed that the personnel strength of Skibbereen Garda station as at 31 March 2006 was ten, all ranks. Garda management reports that Skibbereen Garda station is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday to Saturday. At present, Skibereen Garda station is closed on Sundays. However Garda management states that it is proposed to open Skibbereen Garda Station from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Sundays during the summer months. Garda management further states that it will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Cork west division with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. The division&rsquo;s resources are further <Col N="1430"/>augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and other specialised units.</P>

        <P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of<?oasys _jy ?>Skibbereen Garda station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The person concerned entered the State on 8 May 2002 on foot of a &ldquo;D&rdquo; employment visa. He attended at his local immigration office on 12 June 2002 and he was granted permission to remain on work permit conditions until 29 March 2003. In January 2006 an immigration officer based at the immigration office, Garda station, Drogheda, County Louth became aware that the person concerned was in employ<Col N="1431"/>ment in County Louth and in February 2006 visited premises where he believed the person referred to was living. A request was made, pursuant to the provisions of section 12 of the Immigration Act 2004, to produce a valid passport or equivalent document issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his identity. He failed to produce such documentation and proceedings have now been commenced against him in respect of an alleged breach of the provisions of sections 12 (1)(a), and (2) and section 13 of the Immigration Act 2004 and he is summonsed to appear at Dundalk District Court on 5 April 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Notification under section 3(4) of the Immigration Act 1999 has now issued to the person concerned as he has remained in the State since the 29 March 2003 without the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has also engaged in employment without a current work permit which is in direct contravention of the Employment Permits Act 2003.</P>
        <P>Under section 3(4) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, it is now open to the person concerned to choose one of following options: leave the State before the Minister decides the matter, section 3(4)(<i>b</i>); consent to the making of a deportation order, section 3(4)(<i>c</i>); or make representations to remain temporarily in the State.</P>

	<P>The average processing time for applications for certificates of naturalisation is currently 24 months. The lengthy processing time for applications is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications that were received in the last number of years. The following table shows the number of applications received in the years 2000 to 2005, inclusive.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have informed this House on a number of occasions that the major reduction in the number <Col N="1432"/>of asylum applications has given me an opportunity to refocus resources in areas of service provision for non-nationals. Citizenship is but one of the services provided by the Irish naturalisation and immigration service. While the number of staff working exclusively on citizenship matters has doubled to 41 since November 2004, other sections within the broad immigration area, such as those dealing with visas and residency applications, have also been expanded to cope with the additional workload in those areas.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who are suitably qualified. I believe it would be beneficial to the Deputy if I set out a short synopsis of the procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine whether the statutory application is completed fully. Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment. Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act. Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and inquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary. Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, more than 1,400 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible. All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant&rsquo;s financial status in respect of his or her ability to support himself or herself in the State. Inquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard. At the same time inquiries are also made with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to clarify whether the applicant can be deemed to be of good character. Certain circumstances in individual cases may require a greater level of investigation than other cases. Once all inquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision. The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.</P>
        <P>The procedures outlined have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process. Consequently, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table provides the total number of headline offences, by group, recorded and detected in the Garda division of Laois-Offaly for the years 2000 to 2005, inclusive.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the PULSE computer system by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1999 has led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. Consequently the statistics provided for 1997 are not comparable to statistics provided for 2000 and subsequent years. The figures provided for 2000 and 2001 are incomplete due to the phased implementation of PULSE. The first full year captured is 2002 and is a more accurate base year to use.</P><Col N="1434"/>
        <P>It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of more than 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population. To put this in context, during the two full years of the rainbow coalition Government, with a population of 600,000 less than at present, the headline crime figures were as follows: 102,484 in 1995; and 100,785 in 1996.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the headline offence of homicide includes not only murder and manslaughter but also the other homicide offences of infanticide, abortion, attempted murder and threat to murder. Over the six-year period shown in the table four murders were recorded with three detected, and one manslaughter was recorded with one detected.</P><Col N="1433"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following tables provide the total number of headline offences, by group, recorded and detected in the Garda divisions of Cork north and Cork west for the years 2000 to 2005, inclusive.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the PULSE computer system by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1999 has led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. Consequently the statistics provided for 1997 are not comparable to statistics provided for 2000 and subsequent years. The figures provided for 2000 and 2001 are incomplete due to the phased implementation of PULSE. The first full year captured is 2002 and is a more accurate base year to use.</P>
        <P>It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million <Col N="1435"/>people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of more than 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population. To put this in context, during the two full years of the rainbow coalition Government, with a population of 600,000 less than at present, the headline crime figures were as follows: 102,484 in 1995; and 100,785 in 1996.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the headline offence of homicide includes not only murder and <Col N="1436"/>manslaughter but also the other homicide offences of infanticide, abortion, attempted murder and threat to murder. Over the six year period shown in the table for the Garda division of Cork north three murders were recorded with three detected and two manslaughters were recorded with two detected. In the same period in the Garda division of Cork west no murders were recorded, and one manslaughter was recorded that has not been detected to date.</P><Col N="1435"/>

        <P FLI="0">The decrease shown in Garda personnel assigned to the Donegal division between 1997 and 2004 reflects the fact that the necessity for the large Garda presence in the Border counties has significantly diminished since the Good Friday Agreement. However, the Deputy will note the increase in numbers from 416 in 2002 to 433 on 31 March 2006. The division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and other specialised units.</P>

The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005.

	<P>I am aware that such a submission by the Retired Prison Officers Association was made to my predecessor.</P>
        <P>Clause 2(iii) of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, PCW, provided that claims for improvements in pay and conditions be addressed on a basis which would involve change in structures, work practices or other conditions of service. Negotiations took place with the Prison Officers Association under this clause and agreement on a package of measures was reached. One of the issues which was agreed with the association was that rent allowance would be pensionable to members of the Prison Service serving on or after 1 January 1994. It was also agreed with the association that rent allowance would be reckonable for the purpose of calculating lump sums or death gratuity in the case of members who retired or died in service in the <Col N="1443"/>period 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1993. In such cases pension would only be adjusted to take account of rent allowance with effect from 1 January 1994.</P>
        <P>Making rent allowance pensionable had cost implications. As clause 2(iii) of the PCW put a ceiling on the overall cost of agreements, a cut-off date for the pensionability of rent allowance needed to be agreed. The dates outlined were an integral part of the agreement with the association.</P>
        <P>The issue of pensions generally is a matter for the Minister for Finance. It is established practice that if an allowance becomes pensionable, or a new pensionable allowance is introduced with effect from a specific date, officers who have retired before that date do not benefit from such development. This has been consistent policy for all public service groups.</P>

	<P>The interim parole board, which replaced the sentence review group, was established on an administrative basis in April 2001. The board&rsquo;s principal function is to advise me on the administration of long-term prison sentences.</P>
        <P>Generally, the cases of prisoners sentenced to eight years or more, but fewer than 14 years, are reviewed at the half sentence stage. The cases of prisoners sentenced to 14 years or more, including life, are reviewed after seven years have been served. Prisoners serving sentences for certain offences, such as the murder of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Prison Service in the course of their duty, are excluded from the process. The board, by way of recommendation to me, advises of the prisoner&rsquo;s progress to date, the degree to which the prisoner has engaged with the various therapeutic services and how best to proceed with the future administration of the sentence. I consider in full all recommendations put before me by the interim parole board before making the final decision regarding sentence management.</P>
        <P>The parole board&rsquo;s secretariat has advised that the case referred to by the Deputy has been scheduled for review for later this month.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that all Garda vehicles are serviced in accordance with, or in excess of, the manufacturers&rsquo; recommendations. The day-to-day responsibility for Garda vehicles lies with the district to which the vehicle is assigned. It is the responsibility of the Garda fleet management section to develop policies to ensure that vehicles are maintained in a proper roadworthy condition. The policy for maintenance of the fleet is, where feasible, to use main dealers for a particular make. This will ensure, as far as is possible, that the maintenance of the vehicle complies with standards set by the manufacturers. Every service on a Garda vehicle is a full service. All-important components are checked, particularly those which may impinge on the safety of a vehicle and more particularly the braking components of that vehicle.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed that the recommendations of the jury at the inquest of the person struck by a Garda car in Clonskeagh are under consideration by the Commissioner at this time. The Garda Commissioner has recently been authorised to &ldquo;retire&rdquo; existing Garda vehicles earlier to keep the fleet in top condition. High mileage patrol cars will be withdrawn and replaced on an accelerated basis over 2006 and 2007 with vehicles which have the most modern driver safety features available.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that Garda CCTV systems have been installed at three locations in the greater Dublin area. Each of the CCTV systems is operated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is equipped with technology to monitor, read and print images recorded by the CCTV system. The systems are located at O&rsquo;Connell Street, Pearse Street and Temple Bar and D&uacute;n Laoghaire. The O&rsquo;Connell Street CCTV system has 44 cameras and is monitored at the Garda office on <Col N="1445"/>O&rsquo;Connell Street. The Pearse Street and Temple Bar CCTV system has 25 cameras and is monitored at Pearse Street Garda station. The D&uacute;n Laoghaire CCTV system has nine cameras and is monitored at D&uacute;n Laoghaire Garda station. The Garda traffic management centre, which is located at the Garda&rsquo;s Dublin metropolitan region headquarters in Harcourt Square, has the ability to access and monitor cameras as required from the Pearse Street and Temple Bar and O&rsquo;Connell Street CCTV systems, as well as cameras attached to Dublin City Council&rsquo;s traffic management system. Further CCTV systems will be installed in Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Tallaght as part of the ongoing Garda CCTV programme, under which CCTV systems are being installed at 17 other locations. I hope to have the systems in operation at the earliest opportunity, subject to compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.</P>
        <P>People operating a Garda CCTV system must adhere strictly to a code of practice for the use of such systems. The code was drafted in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which is the State agency responsible for providing guidance on matters relating to the electronic processing of data; in this instance, recorded CCTV images. The code of practice reflects domestic and international best practice. I commenced the provisions of section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides a statutory basis for the operation of CCTV systems in public places by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and certain other bodies, on 31 March 2006.</P>

	<P>I asked the Garda authorities for a report on the issues raised by the Deputy. I will give a summary of the events in question, as reported to me by the Garda authorities. The person in question was charged with assault, contrary to section 2 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, and with trespass, contrary to section 11 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, arising from an incident at the home of one of his neighbours on 15 August 2005. <Col N="1446"/>He appeared at Tipperary District Court on 3 January last and was remanded on bail until 7 February. On the latter date, he was present in court and was accompanied by a solicitor who was representing him. At approximately 12.20 p.m., the person in question approached a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in court and handed him a medical certificate that did not relate to diabetes. He was urged to remain in court to explain the situation or, at least, to advise his solicitor of the position. He had been in court for less than two hours at this time and there had been no mention of a diabetic episode. The garda in question advised the person&rsquo;s solicitor and gave him the medical certificate. When the case was called, the solicitor advised the court that his client had been present but had taken ill and he handed the medical certificate to the court. These facts were confirmed to the court by the prosecuting inspector.</P>
        <P>The judge issued a bench warrant for the arrest of the person, which was executed on 14 February. While he was detained at Tipperary Garda station, the person complained of chest pain and requested medical attention. He was removed to St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital in Clonmel, where he remained until 17 February when he was taken by the Garda before Clonmel District Court. The case stands adjourned for hearing on 16 May 2006 at Tipperary District Court. The Garda authorities have advised me that there is no difficulty in distinguishing between the person referred to and his son of the same name. No issue in this regard was raised in respect of these proceedings. The Garda has no input or control over the court lists. Neither the person referred to nor his legal representative requested to have the case called out of sequence.</P>

	<P>The person in question arrived in the State on 25 January 2005 and applied for asylum. Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The person was informed by letter dated 8 September 2005 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her. She was afforded her three options in accordance with section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended: to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit within 15 working days representations in writing to the Minister setting out the reasons she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. The person&rsquo;s case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, which relates to the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>. All representations received on behalf of the person for temporary leave to remain in the State were considered.</P>
        <P>Representations were received from the person&rsquo;s legal representatives, advising officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that she had given birth to a baby boy who was born in the State on 9 June 2005. On 18 November 2005 a deportation order was signed in respect of the person. Notice of the order was served by registered post, requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 1 December 2005 to make arrangements for her removal from the State. She presented herself as required and has been given further presentation dates in the interim. She most recently presented herself to the Garda at Anglesea Street Garda station in Cork on 30 March last and is due to present again today. Further medical reports in respect of the child have recently been received from the legal representatives of the person concerned and a further medical report will issue in June 2006. On that basis, an undertaking has been given not to effect the deportation pending receipt of the further medical reports. In the meantime, all reporting arrangements imposed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau on the person are to be observed. I intend to reconsider the case following a detailed examination of all medical reports submitted.</P>

I have been further informed that the other member of staff attached to the press office is a <Col N="1449"/>clerical officer. Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the civilianisation programme approved by the Government in 2001. Some 113 civilian finance officers have been appointed and are carrying out the district finance officer duties which were performed by garda&iacute; before now. The recent establishment of the Garda information service centre, which is manned by civilian staff, in Castlebar and the pending transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as civil servants of the State are significant developments in the context of greater Garda civilianisation. The establishment of the information service centre will, when fully operational, allow for the equivalent of up to 300 garda&iacute; to be released for frontline outdoor policing duties on a daily basis. A further review of civilianisation possibilities in the Garda is under way with a view to securing many more redeployments of desk-bound garda&iacute; to frontline operational duties over the next four years.</P>

Therefore, the personnel strength of the Garda increased by 1,743, or 16.3%, during that period. The personnel strength of the Limerick division on 3 April 2006 was 482, comprising one chief superintendent, five superintendents, ten inspectors, 69 sergeants and 397 garda&iacute;. The personnel strength of the Limerick division on 31 December 1997 was 423, all ranks. Therefore, the personnel strength of the Garda in the division increased by 59, or 14%, during that period. The division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised units.</P><Col N="1450"/>
        <P Just="Left">Garda management is responsible for the allocation of personnel throughout and within divisions on a priority basis, in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs. The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the force, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, remains as it was when I announced in October 2004 that the Government had approved my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college in 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by means of intakes to the college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner is drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage the additional resources. The needs of the Limerick division will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The number of garda&iacute; allocated to Blanchardstown Garda station increased by 77, or 87.5%, over that period, during which time it became the district K headquarters of the Dublin metropolitan region&rsquo;s west division. The figures requested in respect of the number of personnel attached to Blanchardstown Garda station in January 1996 are not available because the statistics compiled prior to 1997 were compiled on a divisional basis. The resources of the Dublin metropolitan region&rsquo;s west division are further augmented by a number of Garda national units, such as the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised units. Garda management has said it will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Dublin metropolitan region&rsquo;s west division with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel throughout and within divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of such resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs.</P>

The allocation of resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs. The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the force, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, remains as it was when I announced in October 2004 that the Government had approved my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college in 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by means of intakes to the college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner is drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage the additional resources. The needs of Blanchardstown Garda station will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Therefore, the number of garda&iacute; stationed in the Cork north division increased by 28, or 12.5%, during that period. The division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised units.</P>
        <P>Garda management is responsible for the allocation of personnel throughout and within divisions on a priority basis, in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs. The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the force, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, remains as it was when I announced in October 2004 that the Government had approved my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college in 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by means of intakes to the college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner is drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage the additional resources. The needs of the Cork north and Cork west Garda divisions will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the following table outlines the total number of headline offences, by group, recorded and detected in the Garda division of Sligo-Leitrim between 2000 and 2005, inclusive. The introduction of the PULSE computer system by the Garda in 1999 has led to more complete and comprehensive recording of the crimes which are reported. Therefore, the statistics provided for 1997 are not comparable to the statistics provided for 2000 and subsequent years and the figures provided for 2000 and 2001 are incomplete due to the phased implementation of the PULSE system. The first full year captured <Col N="1456"/>by the system is 2002, which is a more accurate base year to use. Any interpretation of the crime figures should consider the increase in population over the last ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 people. In 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million people, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 people. Therefore, there has been a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 people. During the rainbow coalition Government, when there was a population of 600,000 less than at present, there were 102,484 headline crimes in 1995 and 100,785 headline crimes in 1996. The headline offence of homicide includes not only murder and manslaughter but the other homicide offences of infanticide, abortion, attempted murder and threat to murder. Over the six-year period shown in the table, four murders were recorded, of which two were detected; and two manslaughters recorded, both of which were detected.</P><Col N="1455"/>

        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Garda management is responsible for the allocation of personnel throughout and within divisions on a priority basis, in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs. The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the force, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, remains as it was when I announced in October 2004 that the Government had approved my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college in 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by means of intakes to the college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner is drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage the additional resources. The needs of the Roscommon-Galway east Garda division will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the following table outlines the total number of headline offences, by group, recorded and detected in the Garda division of Donegal between 2000 and 2005, inclusive. The introduction of the PULSE computer system by the Garda in 1999 has led to more complete and comprehensive recording of the crimes which are reported. Therefore, the statistics provided for 1997 are not comparable to the statistics provided for 2000 and subsequent years and the figures provided for 2000 and 2001 are incomplete due to the phased implementation of the PULSE system. The first full year captured by the system is 2002, which is a more accurate base year to use. Any interpretation of the crime figures should consider the increase in population over the last ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 people. In 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million people, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 people. Therefore, there has been a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 people. During the rainbow coalition Government, when there was a population of 600,000 less than at present, there were 102,484 headline crimes in 1995 and 100,785 headline crimes in 1996. It should also be noted that the headline offence of homicide includes not only murder and manslaughter but also the other homicide offences of infanticide, abortion, attempted murder and threat to murder. Over the six-year period shown in the table, two murders were recorded, one of which was detected, and no manslaughters were recorded.</P><Col N="1457"/>

	<P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is fully committed to the employment of people with disabilities, where possible. Its policy is to ensure that people with disabilities are facilitated with access to employment opportunities and that every necessary accommodation is made in this regard. To that end, the Department has a disability liaison officer whose role is to act as a point of contact within and between Departments for information and advice on disability. The employee assistance service plays a valuable role in this regard, as do management and staff within the Department. Disability awareness training has been provided to a number of staff in the personnel area.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service has a key role to play in creating employment opportunities which might not otherwise be available. The Minister for Finance is responsible for this target, which applies across the Civil Service and not just to individual Departments. The percentage of people with a disability in the Department stands at 5.08%, representing some 148 people. I am anxious to ensure that the Government target is achieved and surpassed if at all possible. The Department continues to liaise on an ongoing basis with the Public Appointments Service to recruit people with disabilities. As a result, a number of people with disabilities were recruited in the past year. The Department also employed a number of graduates with disabilities on a work placement programme during the summer, giving them valuable work experience relevant to their studies and skills. As this worked out well, I am pleased to say that we will offer further such placements this year under the willing able mentoring project, which is part funded under the EQUAL initiative.</P>

        <Quest>the reason for the discrepancy in the figures for speeding detections by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2004 (details supplied); if he will offer an explanation for the figure of 141, 723 which he gave in reply to a parliamentary question on 23 March 2006 regarding the number of on-the-spot speeding fines issued for 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the figure 211,928, provided in response to Question No. 658 of 18 October 2005, relates to speeding detections for all classes of vehicles as supplied by each divisional officer. I am further informed that the figure of 161,192 provided in response to Question No. 477 of 31 January 2006, relates to detections of speeding cars only. Further details are available in the eval<Col N="1460"/>uation of the policing plan, 2004, included with the Commissioner&rsquo;s annual report for that year. The figure of 141,723 provided in response to Question No. 178 of 23 March 2006 refers to the number of speeding notices issued in 2004, not the number of detections in that year.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned arrived in the State on 15 April 2005 and applied for asylum. Their application was refused following consideration of their case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The persons concerned were informed, by letter dated 12 August 2005, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them and afforded them three options under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended; namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit written representations, within 15 working days, setting out reasons they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Their case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>. Additionally, consideration was given to all representations received on behalf of the persons concerned. On 10 November 2005, deportation orders were signed in respect of the persons concerned, including a child born in the State on 25 May 2005. Notice of these orders was served by registered post requiring the persons concerned to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on Thursday, 24 November 2005, in order to make arrangements for their deportation from the State. The persons concerned failed to present themselves as required on this occasion and were thus classified as evaders. However, the persons concerned were deported from the State on 8 December 2005 by charter flight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy might wish to note that, in addition to the 11 factors contained in section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, I must also have regard to section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>, before making a deportation order. This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or <i>refoulement</i> as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order, that is, a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State <Col N="1461"/>where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to Nigeria and other third countries. In this case, I was entirely satisfied that there were no <i>refoulement</i> related reasons to prevent the deportation of the persons concerned. I am satisfied that the applications made by the persons concerned for asylum and for leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport them was justified.</P>

	<P>The Garda central vetting unit, GCVU, was established in 2002 and currently processes vetting requests in respect, <i>inter alia</i>, of prospective full-time employees of the Health Service Executive and certain agencies funded by it, as well as in respect of selected employments in other sectors. In 2004, an inter-agency working group on Garda vetting reported with a clear and focused strategy for enhancing national vetting arrangements. The strategy provides for an expansion of the GCVU&rsquo;s vetting service to all organisations which recruit persons having substantial, unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. The implementation of the strategy is being overseen by an implementation group on Garda vetting comprising key stakeholders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The GCVU has been successfully decentralised to new, custom-designed office accommodation in Thurles, County Tipperary. Since its decentralisation in November 2005 new liaison mechanisms have been successfully implemented in the Health Service Executive and are now being extended to all organisations previously registered for vetting. Significant changes have been made in the work processes of the unit in order to streamline the processing of vetting applications and have resulted in an improved service being provided. In addition, an additional 17 staff have been provided to the GCVU to more than double its numbers from 13 to 30. The expansion of the Garda vetting service to new organisations and sectors will be by way of a phased roll-out to an increasing number of organisations in the child care and vulnerable adult care sector and a phased expansion plan, within current resource capacity, has been prepared and accepted by the <Col N="1462"/>implementation group on Garda vetting. This has resulted in an increase in the number of Health Service Executive personnel being vetted in the first quarter in 2006, as well as vetting being introduced for the private security authority. A number of organisations from the voluntary sector are currently being identified for vetting services. The expansion of the service being provided by the GCVU is proceeding in a planned and structured manner in consultation with Departments responsible for childcare, and will continue until vetting is provided for all personnel working in a full time, part-time and or voluntary capacity with children and or vulnerable adults.</P>

	<P>A traffic corps, headed by an assistant commissioner, was established within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in November 2004. The number of garda&iacute; assigned exclusively to traffic duties is increasing dramatically &mdash; from approximately 530 members of the traffic corps in 2004 to 803 in 2006, 1030 in 2007 and 1,200 in 2008. Some 240 additional garda&iacute; will join the corps in the course of 2006.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that traffic policy demands vary from place to place and time to time. It is a matter for local Garda management to schedule operations to meet what is required and provide optimum use of resources.

	<P>An application for permission <Col N="1463"/>to remain in the State based on marriage to an Irish national was received from the person concerned in October 2005. Applications of this type, in fairness to all other such applicants, are dealt with in strict chronological order and currently take approximately 16 months to process. It should be noted that marriage to an Irish national does not confer an automatic right of residence in the State.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that a person who is awaiting a decision on a residency application based on marriage to an Irish national is free to leave the State at any time. A visa required national must be in possession of a valid Irish visa to allow the person concerned travel to the State. As the person in question is a visa required national, he would require a re-entry visa to return to the State. It is not the normal practice of my Department to assist persons who do not have residency in the State with a re-entry visa prior to travelling except in certain emergency circumstances. Applications of this nature are considered on a case by case basis by the immigration division of my Department.</P>

Following a re-examination of the case, the decision to refuse was upheld on 19 October 2005.

	<P>While there are general claims of under reporting of crime, there is no evidence that the level of under reporting now is any greater than in the past, or that the proportion of unreported crime in Ireland is any greater than in other jurisdictions. The problems of unreported and unrecorded crime are well documented in the international criminological literature, and are in no way unique to this country.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the introduction of PULSE has improved the accuracy and comprehensiveness of Garda statistics &mdash; for example, the system demands that incidents now have to be recorded before particular actions can be taken.</P>
        <P>In July 2003, the Government approved my proposal that a regular national crime victimisation survey be carried out biennially as a valuable and useful complement to the information on crime already available, which includes the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s annual report and the headline crime figures which I publish on an annual and quarterly basis. Such surveys would provide a more comprehensive perspective on crime victimisation than is currently available and when undertaken on a regular basis, would provide useful information on emerging trends in <Col N="1467"/>crime and so provide input into developing strategies to combat crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The expert group on crime statistics, which I established and the report of which I published in July 2004, recommended the establishment of a central crime statistics unit, which would, <i>inter alia</i>, examine the collation of information relating to crimes reported to and recorded by the Garda, examine the collation of information relating to other crimes where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not the prosecuting authority, identify the needs of key stakeholders within the criminal justice system and the wider research community and publish criminal justice statistics, based initially on PULSE data. I accepted the recommendation that such a unit be established and work is underway on establishing it within the Central Statistics Office.</P>
        <P>The report of the expert group strongly endorsed the Government decision to conduct biennial national crime victimisation surveys and recommended that the new unit be responsible for overseeing the national crime victimisation survey and involved in its design and planning. I also accepted this recommendation and work on the survey will be undertaken by the unit as part of its duties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand from the Central Statistics Office that a crime and victimisation survey is to be carried out, either via a dedicated survey or a module of the quarterly national household survey, QNHS, in 2006. This latter approach has previously been used in both 1998 and 2003. The Central Statistics Office expects that dedicated crime and victimisation surveys will be carried out in 2008 and biennially thereafter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also understand that the Central Statistics Office intends to develop these surveys in a way that will maximise their utility and their coherence with other administrative data available in the criminal justice system. It is important to note that the data that will result from these surveys will not be directly comparable to the crime statistics based on data recorded by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as there will be fundamental differences in sources, definitions and classification methodology. As a result of these surveys, we will have a greater understanding as to why some victims chose not to report cases to the Garda and what we can do with regard to reduce the level of under reporting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are sufficient measures in place to facilitate the reporting of all offences. These measures include 999 emergency calls, phone calls, visits to Garda stations, and the availability of garda&iacute; on mobile and beat patrols. I am assured that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na urges all members of the public to report any matters of a criminal nature for investigation by them.</P>

The Garda authorities have also established a national advisory panel, which includes members who represent the GLBT perspective, to assist and inform garda&iacute; on matters relating to their community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to hate crime, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, created an offence, <i>inter alia</i>, of using words or behaviour that are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended, or are likely, to stir up hatred.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Hatred&rdquo; is defined as hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation. Public incitement to racial hatred is a criminal offence under sections 2 and 3 of the 1989 Act in terms of material, written or oral, which is threatening, abusive or insulting.</P>
        <P>The announcement of a review of the incitement to hatred legislation was made by my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at a time when few if any successful prosecutions had been taken under the Act. One of the aims of the review was to ascertain whether problems with the Act were contributing to this lack of prosecutions and, if so, whether reasonable changes to it could remedy that situation. Since the review was announced, a number of successful prosecutions have been taken under the 1989 Act. These trends are being monitored as part of the ongoing review and if maintained could have a significant influence on the outcome of the review and any subsequent proposals for legislation.</P>
        <P>Apart from the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 is the main relevant legislative instruments pertaining to hate crime. That Act created an offence of using or engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place. It also created an offence of distributing <Col N="1469"/>or displaying in a public place material which is threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department provides funding towards the cost of providing secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which the Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new ones are being created. This has been superseded by a scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant.</P>
        <P>The ancillary services grant scheme is flexible in nature, giving boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The Department does not stipulate any rules concerning how secretarial or caretaking services are to be obtained by the school. It is a matter for the individual school to decide how best to apply the funding to suit the school&rsquo;s particular needs. In this regard it should be noted that the grant aid may be used by a school to provide both secretarial and caretaking services or, if a school so wishes, it may decide to use the grant aid in its entirety in respect of one service only. The secretaries and caretakers are employees of individual schools. The Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme, which was increased from &euro;102 in 2002 to &euro;127 in 2004, was increased by a further &euro;6 to &euro;133 in 2005. The rate has been increased by a further &euro;6 this year bringing the rate to &euro;139 per pupil.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Boards of management of individual schools are expected to comply with employment legislation and to this end have been directed by way of circular that any queries they may have as regards employment legislation should be addressed to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment at 01-6312121, Lo-call 1890 22 02 22, or <i>www.entemp.ie</i>.</P><Col N="1470"/>

	<P>DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP. The process of identifying primary and second level schools for participation in the new school support programme has been completed.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new programme. These comprise 640 primary schools, 320 urban-town schools and 320 rural schools, and 200 second level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second level schools for participation in the new school support programme was managed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.</P>
        <P>The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the school support programme. The variables involved were: % unemployment; % local authority accommodation; % lone parenthood; % Travellers; % large families, five or more children; % pupils eligible for free books.</P>
        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is not among the 640 primary schools selected for participation in the school support programme. However, this school is among the schools receiv<Col N="1472"/>ing additional resources under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage and will retain these supports for 2006-07. The efficacy of these supports will be kept under review.</P>
        <P>As well as the provision being made under the new school support programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed. This support will be based on the results of the new identification process and the arrangements which will apply in this regard will be notified to schools early in the autumn.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. This mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The school to which the Deputy refers has requested a review and a review form issued to the school on 7 March 2006. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31 March 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, my Department has introduced a general allocation model of additional resources to all primary schools for children in the high incidence categories of special educational needs. This enables an automatic response on the part of schools to any child deemed to be in need of additional teaching resources. In the case of children within these categories, the intelligence quotient is not the sole issue that determines whether or not a child can access additional support in school.</P>
        <P>Of course, it may take some time in the case of young children in school for the extent of their needs to emerge. The needs of such children are normally kept under review by the school and it is for the school authorities in conjunction with the various support agencies to make application for psychological and other assessments to determine if a child falls into the category of low incidence. Subsequently, the school authorities can make application to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, for additional resources in the case of a child diagnosed as being within any of the low incidence categories of disability.</P>
        <P>The ranges of assessed intellectual ability associated with the categories of special need identified by my Department as low incidence are in line with the bands identified and described in the report of the special education review committee, 1993. They are also in line with the most frequently used psychometric instruments.</P>
        <P>While the system of provision will be kept under constant review by my Department and by the NCSE, I am confident that provision is being provided for all children in school with special needs.</P>

	<P>The vast bulk of the cost of school building projects is borne by my Department. In general, where a school is not owned by my Department, a local contribution of 10% of the project cost is required for school building projects. This is capped at &euro;63,500 for new schools and &euro;31,500 for extension projects. The amount of the local contribution for schools with disadvantaged status is 5% of the project cost subject to a maximum amount of &euro;12,500.</P>
        <P>A change was made in recent years whereby my Department may purchase a site for a new school building and provide the full cost of its provision.

	<P>It is not clear to what additional regulations the Deputy refers. Section 10 of the Education Act 1998 provides for the recognition of new schools by the Minister. The application procedure for the process involved was revised in 2002 based on the recommendations in the Commission on School Accommodation&rsquo;s report, Criteria and Procedures for the Recognition of New Primary Schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The application procedure involves a number of stages including: formal notification of intention to apply for recognition; public consultation and identification of need; formal application for recognition; assessment of application by the new schools advisory committee &mdash; NSAC; consultation with interested parties; reports to Minister; decision by Minister &mdash; successful applicants will receive temporary recognition at this stage and; provision for appeal by applicant to an independent appeals committee.</P>
        <P>In December 2002 the NSAC was established as part of the process. On receipt of the notifications of intent, the NSAC initiates a public and transparent consultation process and assesses the applications against the published criteria. The NSAC&rsquo;s annual programme of work culminates in a report to the Minister with recommendations on the granting of recognition to applicants.</P>
        <P>The following are the criteria for recognition of new primary schools: There must be evidence that the proposed school meets a need that cannot reasonably be met within existing provision; the local community is consulted in advance; the patron has been registered as such by the Minister for Education and Science; a board of management will be appointed in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Education and Science; the rules for national schools will be complied with; the pro<Col N="1477"/>posed school has a minimum initial enrolment of 17 junior infants and a minimum projected enrolment of 51 pupils for the third year of operation; all pupils are at least four years of age on 30 September of the year in which the school is due to commence operation; in accordance with section 10(2)(<i>e</i>) of the Education Act 1998, proposed interim school accommodation must comply with the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, the Building Regulations 1991 to 1997, including the Building Control Regulations, and the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2001 and any modifications, statutory instruments or orders made in accordance with these Acts; the school will follow the primary school curriculum of the Department of Education and Science; the school will employ recognised primary school teachers; and a school may apply for permanent recognition when it has complied with all the conditions of temporary recognition.</P>

	<P>Section 8 of the Education Act 1998 provides that the person who was recognised as a patron, trustee, member of the board of governors, or the owners of a school in the absence of governors-trustees, at the time of commencement of the Act was automatically entitled to be a patron for the purposes of the Education Act. In any other case, the patron is the person requesting recognition of a school, or his or her nominee.</P>
        <P>The basis for recognising new schools derives from the provisions of section 10 of the Education Act 1998 which allows a prospective patron to seek approval for a school that reflects the characteristic spirit of the sponsor.</P>
        <P>Generally, the patronage of a school does not change unless a patron body wishes to withdraw from provision or unless two or more schools having a different patron wish to amalgamate. The latter generally results in an agreed patronage arrangement among the schools concerned.</P>

	<P>There are six primary gaelscoileanna in County Kildare. In the 2004-05 school year, the last year for which details are available, these schools were paid a total of &euro;432,612.54 towards their day-to-day running costs. A total of 57 full-time primary teachers were employed in the six schools in question in the 2004-05 school year.</P>
        <P>The average cost of employing a teacher in a primary school in the 2004-05 school year was &euro;55,000, inclusive of employers PRSI. The information in regard to the provision of accommodation is not readily available in the format requested. However, the following is the position with regard to accommodation for all newly established school regardless of ethos. All new schools commence operation with provisional recognition from my Department. During this period of provisional recognition, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to provide a permanent school building.</P>
        <P>My Department grant-aids the provision of temporary accommodation at a rate of 75% for schools with provisional recognition and 95% for schools with permanent recognition. However, notwithstanding these rates, a school&rsquo;s contribution is capped at &euro;3,175 per calendar year.</P>
        <P>The overall accommodation cost is individual to each school and depends on the type and extent of accommodation required and whether or not site works are required etc.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. In general, the board has the responsibility to ensure that the school operates efficiently and effectively and also has responsibilities in regard to the action of its employees.</P>
        <P>My Department supports the principle that complaints regarding schools should be resolved at school level whenever possible and will only become involved in an investigation of specific complaints after every effort has been made to resolve the matter at local level.</P>
        <P>On 13 March 2006, the patron of the school referred to by the Deputy dissolved the board of management and, with my approval, appointed a single manager to manage the school for a period of six months in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Education Act 1998.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that a sufficient period of time must be afforded to the single manager to address the difficulties within the school. My Department will, however, continue to give support and guidance to the school authorities where necessary.</P>

	<P>A range of actions that focus on improving students&rsquo; competence in spoken and written Irish and on increasing the attractiveness of the language to all learners in post-primary schools have been taken or are under way. A very significant development was the introduction in September 2004 of a revised literature course for leaving certificate Irish, which will be examined for the first time in 2006. This has been widely welcomed because it allows literature to be taught using modern communicative approaches that appeal to young people and affords a high level of choice to students and teachers. For example, film is now an option for the first time. A comprehensive set of guidelines to support teachers in delivering the revised course has been issued.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware from replies to previous parliamentary questions, I have asked the advisory body on curriculum reform, the NCCA, to make proposals to me as soon as possible on how the Irish curriculum should be reformed and in particular how greater emphasis can be placed on oral Irish. I am determined to ensure that Irish is taught in our schools in a way that is interesting and relevant and that will promote a positive attitude to the language among young people.</P>

	<P>My Department specifies the minimum academic requirements for entry to primary teacher training courses provided in the colleges of education. As part of these requirements, all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a grade C in higher level in Irish in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent. This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student&rsquo;s proficiency in Irish.</P>
        <P>My Department considers the grade C in higher level in Irish in the leaving certificate to be the minimum standard in Irish necessary for students entering a teacher training course to equip them to teach Irish to pupils at all levels in primary schools.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school in question, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 91 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule, circular 0023/2006, which has issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006-07 school year will be a principal and three mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>Primary schools catering for non-national pupils who have significant English language deficits are entitled to assistance to enable these pupils gain full access to the curriculum. The school has the services of two temporary language support teachers for the current year.</P>
        <P>The school in question will be paid enrolment based grants for capitation and ancillary services based on their enrolments in the current school year. The school has been paid &euro;12,649 in respect of the ancillary grant in March 2006 and &euro;8,919.54 in January 2006 in respect of the first moiety, 70%, of the capitation grant. The second moiety, 30%, of the capitation grant will be paid in June.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the inclusion of schools in the new school support programme, SSP, under the DEIS action plan, separate arrangements are being put in place to address exceptional situations arising up to the time of the next identification process which will be held in 2009-10. These arrangements will take account of new schools, including those created through amalgamation, opening in 2005-06 or thereafter.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board which was established to <Col N="1483"/>adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in circular 0024/2006, appeal board for mainstream staffing in primary schools, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools shortly.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the first meeting of the appeal board will be held in May 2006. Further meetings will be held in July and October 2006. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 12 May, 24 June and 18 October, respectively.</P>
        <P>Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from primary payments section or on my Department&rsquo;s website. The appeal board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.</P>

	<P>The position is that my Department supports the training and professional development of staff working with children with special educational needs through the special educational support service, SESS. This service, as appropriate, consolidates, co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings. These settings include mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special schools and special classes.

        <P>A sum of &euro;31,000 was provided to the school in question to date. However, the issue of consultancy for special units for children with ASD is now within the remit of the SESS and the school has been advised to contact the SESS in this regard.</P><Col N="1484"/>
        <P>I wish to point out that my Department supports an eclectic approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available, for example, treatment and education of autistic and related communication handicapped children, TEACH, applied behavioural analysis, ABA, picture exchange communication system, PECS. In this regard, it should be noted that none of the classes sanctioned to the school referred to by the Deputy to cater for pupils with autistic spectrum disorders are classified by my Department as dedicated ABA classes.</P>

        <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over key functions from my Department in respect of special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The council acts under the broad <Col N="1485"/>policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities-special needs.</P>
        <P>The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities-special needs.</P>
        <P>The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following: deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours; and processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department&rsquo;s teacher education section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of postgraduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the special education support service, SESS, to support schools staff locally.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 483 and 484 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, differing funding arrangements have evolved for the different school types at second level. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. There are however significant differences in the approaches to the funding of back-up services such as for secretaries and caretakers.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of voluntary secondary schools, which are privately owned. I am aware of concerns expressed by school authorities in relation to increased insurance costs. <i> Per capita</i> grants towards the operating costs of voluntary secondary schools may be used for this purpose.</P>
        <P>In my view it is important to consider the issue of insurance and other costs for voluntary secondary schools in the wider context of the equalisation of funding arrangements across the second level system.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to voluntary secondary schools. Since January 2005, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant has been increased by a cumulative &euro;24 per pupil and now stands at &euro;298. Under the school services support fund initiative, the school services grant has also been increased since January 2005 by a cumulative &euro;28 per pupil bringing the grant from &euro;131 per pupil to &euro;159. These grants are in addition to the <i>per capita</i> funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. A secondary school with 500 pupils, for example, now receives annual grants of up to &euro;270,000 towards general expenses and support services including secretarial services.</P>
        <P>These significant increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There has been enormous progress made over the past number of years regarding increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with SEN. At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>At second level, approximately 1,647 whole-time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs.

        <P>Enormous progress has also been made in respect of increasing the number of SNAs in our schools who specifically cater for the care needs of children with special educational needs.

        <P>In addition, my Department spends over &euro;30 million on school transport and over &euro;3 million towards specialised equipment and materials for pupils with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, I will ensure that all children with special educational needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

	<P>At the outset, I want to say that I am fully conscious that the Dublin 15 area as a whole is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country and, as a result of this, there has been a marked increase in the demand for school places, particularly at primary level.</P><Col N="1489"/>
        <P>My Department is taking a number of measures to increase the capacity of existing schools in the area concerned along with the development of new schools to meet this growing demand. A building project to provide a new building for the particular school to which the Deputy refers was completed in September, 2005. To further increase capacity at the school, my Department approached the board of management in 2005 to discuss the possibility of expanding the school to cater for a four-stream intake at junior infants level. The board agreed to this measure. To facilitate this expansion, my Department purchased additional land adjacent to the school which will enable the construction of an additional 16 classroom school to meet the school&rsquo;s permanent accommodation needs. This new building has a target delivery date of September 2007. In the interim my Department has appointed a consultant architect to oversee the provision of temporary accommodation at the school to meet its immediate needs.</P>
        <P>The area in question is also served by an Educate Together national school. A project to provide a new building for this school is underway with a target delivery date also of September 2007. In the interim my Department has arranged that the school will continue to occupy temporary accommodation at Littlepace.</P>
        <P>I am confident that a combination of the measures outlined will assist in alleviating the demand for pupil places in the area for the foreseeable future. However, due to the current level of demand emanating from the Dublin 15 area, the need to provide even further school accommodation is under consideration and my Department is engaging with the key school patron authorities that are active in the area.</P>

        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has recently moved into a new 24 classroom school and this will facilitate an annual three-stream junior infant intake.

        <P>In parallel with this, my Department is currently in discussions with a second school in the area regarding the possibility of it expanding to cater for an annual four stream intake. The school currently has an intake of three junior infants classes. A building project to provide permanent accommodation for this level of expansion will be afforded the highest priority.</P>
        <P>I am confident that a combination of the measures as outlined will assist in alleviating the demand for pupil places in the area in the short term.

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, is responsible for processing applications from schools for special needs supports such as resource teaching hours for pupils with low incidence special educational needs, SEN, and special needs assistant, SNA, support for pupils with high and low incidence SEN on the basis of individual pupil applications.</P>
        <P>In the event that an application for these supports for a pupil is unsuccessful, the relevant SENO will be prepared to re-examine the application should additional documentation, not available at the time of the original decision, be submitted to him or her by the school. The Deputy will also be aware that my Department implemented a general allocation system of learning support-resource teachers to schools with effect from September 2005. The system is intended to cater for children with learning support and high incidence special educational needs.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with learning support and high-incidence special education needs that will receive supplementary teaching support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met.</P>
        <P>It is intended that a review of the general allocation model will be undertaken within three years of operation.</P>

	<P>First, I would like to clarify that the correspondence referred to by the Deputy relates to special needs assistant, SNA, support in respect of a pupil with special educational needs and not to resource hours. As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which has been operational since 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs, SEN, supports. I can confirm that the school has been allocated five hours individual resource teaching support per week and the services of a full time SNA to cater for the pupil in question.</P>
        <P>The issue referred to in the correspondence relates to the retention of a particular SNA in a school. I wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within a school is a matter for the individual principal or board of management. The board is the SNA&rsquo;s employer and the terms of employment are subject to the conditions of the contract of employment.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the pupil in question will continue to receive the SEN supports appropriate to his needs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The review of funding of the youth work sector is being carried out by McIver Consulting and work commenced in January 2005. A number of issues are currently under discussion between my Department and the consultants with a view to finalising the report. The funding review steering group &mdash; that is, a sub-committee of the national youth work advisory committee &mdash; will then review the final document to ensure that the terms of reference have been adhered to and appropriately dealt with by the consultants. Following this, the report will be finalised as soon as possible. It is intended that following on this process, the national youth work advisory committee, which represents the various youth work interests, will consider the contents of the report in the first instance and that the report, together with the committee&rsquo;s views, will be presented to the Minister of State responsible for youth affairs for consideration in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The review of youth information provision, which is being carried out by A &amp; L Goodbody Consulting, commenced in June 2005. Discussions between my Department and the consultants are at an advanced stage. The youth information steering group, a sub-committee of the national youth work advisory committee, will then review the final document to ensure that the terms of reference have been appropriately dealt with by the consultants. Again, it is expected that following on this process, the national youth work advisory committee will consider the contents of the review in the first instance and that the report, together with the views of the national youth work advisory committee, will be presented to the Minister of State responsible for youth <Col N="1496"/>affairs for consideration in due course.

	<P el="0">There are currently 177 projects for disadvantaged young people funded under the special projects for youth scheme administered by the youth affairs section of my Department, including ten new projects which were grant-aided in 2005. The 10 new projects are: Cobh youth services, Cork; Daybreak programme, Donegal; the Blue Box creative learning centre, Limerick; County Longford youth services, Longford; Kildare youth project, Kildare; Sliabh Luachra project, County Kerry; Shannon youth project, County Clare; Graiguecullen youth project, County Carlow; unaccompanied minors project &mdash; this project is now known as the transition support project &mdash; Dublin; and services to young Travellers, Tallaght, County Dublin.</P>
        <P>A grant of &euro;46,000 was made available towards the support of each of the ten projects in 2005, with full year costs of &euro;92,000 per project approved for 2006. A complete list of all 177 projects located throughout the country is attached at Appendix A. In addition to the establishment of the ten new projects mentioned above, 20 single worker projects were upgraded to two worker projects in 2005.</P>
        <P>The total budgetary provision for youth work purposes within my Department amounts to &euro;47.035 million in 2006. The financial provision for the main funding line for youth work has been increased to &euro;36.7 million in 2006, representing an increase of &euro;2.8 million over the 2005 allocation. The further development of the special project scheme will be examined in the context of the overall allocations for the sector and the phased roll-out of various aspects of the Youth Work Act 2001 and National Youth Work Development Plan 2003-2007.</P>

	<P>DEIS &mdash; delivering equality of opportunity in schools &mdash; the new action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP. The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the new school support programme under DEIS has been completed. This process was managed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.</P>
        <P>The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socioeconomic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the school support programme. The variables involved were: percentage unemployment; percentage local authority accommodation; percentage lone parenthood; percentage Travellers; percentage large families &mdash; five or more children; and percentage pupils eligible for free books. Each school was assigned a score on a 600 point scale, based on 100 points for each of the six variables set out above, by adding up the relevant percentages of <Col N="1503"/>pupils from families in each of the above categories.</P>

	<P>DEIS &mdash; delivering equality of opportunity in schools &mdash; the new action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP. The school support programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the new school support programme under DEIS has been completed. This process was managed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new school support programme. These comprise 640 primary schools &mdash; 320 urban-town schools and 320 rural schools &mdash; and 200 second level schools. Schools not selected to participate in the school support programme but receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage will retain these supports for 2006-2007. The efficacy of these supports will be kept under review.</P>
        <P>As well as the provision being made under the new school support programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed. This support will be based on the results of the new identification process and the arrangements which will apply in this regard will be notified to schools early in the autumn.</P>
        <P>A review process has been put in place for primary and second-level schools that did not qualify for participation in the school support programme and that regard themselves as having <Col N="1504"/>a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31 March, 2006.</P>
        <P>The review process will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The process of appointing this person is being finalised at present and I will be making an announcement on the matter shortly.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the review process will be completed by the end of the current school year.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, is responsible for processing applications from schools for special needs supports such as resource teaching hours and special needs assistant, SNA, support for children with low-incidence special educational needs such as specific speech and language disorder, on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The teaching and SNA support allocated are intended to enable schools to meet the needs of pupils as outlined in psychological and other reports.</P>
        <P>A general allocation system has been introduced under which all mainstream primary schools have been provided with learning support-resource teacher support, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high-incidence special needs such as mild general learning disability and those with learning support needs.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that there are two full-time learning support-resource teachers based in the school referred to by the Deputy. One of the posts is available to the school in question for 15 hours per week and the other post is available for nine hours. This level of support would be adequate to cater for a school of its size and for all pupils with low-incidence special educational needs enrolled there.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the local SENO allocated transitional support in respect of a particular pupil who transferred from a special class last September until the end of the current year. I understand that the pupil had made sufficient <Col N="1505"/>progress in the special class to warrant only temporary resource teacher support in the mainstream class.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 506 to 508, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the Dublin 15 area as a whole is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country and, as a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for primary school places. My Department is taking a number of measures to increase the capacity of existing schools in the area concerned along with the development of new schools to meet this growing demand. All building projects arising from these interventions are awarded a band 1 priority rating under my Department&rsquo;s prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects to ensure that they are delivered as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>In the Littlepace-Castaheaney area a new school building has recently been completed at Mary Mother of Hope national school, with an additional project underway with a target delivery date of September 2007. In addition, a 32-classroom campus is planned for a school site at Ongar. This project will provide a permanent accommodation solution for Castaheaney Educate Together national school. It also has a target completion date of September 2007. This area is also served by the Scared Heart national school, Huntstown, where an extension project to provide a 32 classroom school is nearing completion.</P>
        <P>In the Diswellstown area, St. Patrick&rsquo;s national school has recently moved into a new 24 classroom school. This will facilitate an annual three stream intake. However, as an exceptional matter the board of management ill consider taking a fourth stream of junior infants this year. In addition, my Department is currently in discussions with St. Mochta&rsquo;s national school regarding the possibility of it expanding to cater for an <Col N="1506"/>annual four-stream intake. The school currently has an intake of three junior infant classes. An extension to cater for this development will also attract a band 1 priority rating. The possible need for further accommodation is under active consideration and my Department is engaging with the key patron bodies active in the area in this regard. Other developments in the Dublin 15 area include the planned expansion of St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school in Castleknock and extensions to St. Brigid&rsquo;s boys and girls national schools, Blanchardstown.</P>
        <P>With regard to parents obligations Under the Education (Welfare) Act the position is that, parents are required to ensure that children aged between six and 16 attend school regularly. A person under the age of six is not, therefore, a child for the purposes of the Act and a parent is not under a legal obligation to ensure their attendance at school. Given that there is no question of any six year old year being unable to obtain a place to enrol in junior infants in the Dublin 15 area, parents obligations under the Education (Welfare) act are not affected.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Constitution and the particular article referred to by the Deputy, this states, &ldquo;The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State&rdquo;. Statutory rights to choice of school derives from the Education Act 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard, including promoting &ldquo;the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents&rsquo; choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources&rdquo;. In addition, section 15 (2)(<i>d</i>) of the 1998 Act provides that a board of management of a primary school shall: &ldquo;publish, in such manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school ... and ensure that as regards that, policy principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents&rsquo; choice are respected and such directions as may be made from time to time by the Minister, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the constitutional rights of all persons concerned, are complied with&rdquo;. It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. While my Department would support diverse educational provision in an area, ultimately the extent of such diversity depends on <Col N="1507"/>the willingness of a patron body to provide education with any particular ethos. In the final analysis, it is my Department&rsquo;s remit to ensure that all schools between them in any given area have sufficient accommodation to facilitate all those seeking places in the context of the schools enrolment policies.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>her proposals to reform her Department to ensure that the provision of schools does not rest on the parents in new communities.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The predominant need in new communities is for the establishment of new primary schools for which there is an open and transparent process in place. A central element of this process is that patron bodies wishing to establish new schools must identify the level of demand for the provision of education under the ethos proposed and that potential enrolment will meet certain minimum targets.</P>
        <P>The system was streamlined following recommendations made by the Commission on School Accommodation. As part of the process, the New Schools Advisory Committee, NSAC, which is an independent body, assesses all applications for recognition against published criteria. It conducts an open and transparent public consultation process as part of this assessment. The committee&rsquo;s annual programme of work culminates in a report to the Minister with recommendations on the granting of recognition to applicants. I am happy to support all new schools where it has been clearly demonstrated in accordance with the criteria that a demand exists. This support includes payment of teacher salaries, capitation grants and rental grant aid for accommodation.</P>
        <P>In addition, primary school management bodies and newly established primary schools will benefit from a package of measures which I recently announced. This package recognises specific issues that arise in relation to school start-up.</P>
        <P>I have decided to provide: a training grant of &euro;10,000 for the boards of management and staff of new primary schools established from this year onwards; a training grant of &euro;5,000 for boards of management and staff where the school is in the second year of operation; and the appointment in advance of the school opening of the principal teacher so the he or she can assist in the preparation for the first year of its operation. These measures are a strong indication of my commitment to supporting schools in a start-up situation.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the pressures being placed on education providers in areas of major population growth in particular. To this end, my Department causes sites to be reserved under local authority <Col N="1508"/>area development planning processes so that land will be available to prospective patron bodies for the development of schools. In addition, my Department, is prioritising the provision of new and enhanced educational facilities in these areas. The prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects which were recently revised in consultation with the education partners allocates a top priority band 1 rating to school building projects in such areas.</P>
        <P>To further underpin the establishment of these schools, my Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have assisted patron bodies in the provision of permanent accommodation. One of these changes is acquisition by the state of school sites and another is the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model and the generic repeat design model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new multi-denominational school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in less than 13 months.</P>
        <P>Taken in combination, these measures have greatly alleviated the burden on local communities and my Department will continue to work to provide any additional supports it can give.</P>

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has appointed a full design team on the project with the architectural service for this project being dealt with in-house by the school building section and, indeed, substantial work on the early stages of the design process has already been completed.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s officials have already had a preliminary meeting with the local authority planners of Kilkenny County Council in order to address any possible conditions which the local authority may have in relation to the impending planning application and the school authorities <Col N="1509"/>have been informed of the outcome of the meeting.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at this point to indicate when the planning application will be lodged and when the architectural planning process will be completed.

	<P>The most recent data available on officers in my Department who have a disability indicate that there are 37 such officers, which equates to 3.03% of staff. The guidelines followed for the collection of this information are set out in the Code of Practice for the Civil Service 1994. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s 3% employment target for people with disabilities, as set out in Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>Following the cessation of special competitions for the recruitment of persons with disabilities, due to the Equal Status Act 2000, it is difficult for Departments to positively discriminate in favour of persons with disabilities. Consultants have been engaged centrally within the public service to review the current position and make recommendations to improve the situation. The human <Col N="1512"/>resource strategy for my Department, which was developed through partnership and published in 2005, states that the Department will consider the recommendations in the forthcoming consultants&rsquo; report, with a view to improving the proportion of staff employed with a disability. It is also stated in the HR strategy that the Department is committed to facilitating the appointment of persons with disabilities, through the provision of assistive technology and ensuring physical access.</P>
        <P>The Public Appointments Service recruits the majority of staff for the Department of Education and Science. For certain posts, for example, service support staff, temporary and contract posts, my Department conducts its own recruitment. The Civil Service is an equal opportunities employer. Recruitment to posts within my Department is on the basis of qualifications, where applicable, and the ability to carry out the responsibilities of the grade or post. There are no special qualification criteria for persons with disabilities seeking employment in the Civil Service. Persons with disabilities are entitled to apply for all competitions for which they are eligible and no special application procedures are required. During the selection process and in any subsequent placement in a post, any special needs requirements of an individual will be provided where possible.</P>
        <P>My Department has agreed to participate in the Willing Able Mentoring, WAM, project in 2006. This project aims to give between three to six months quality work experience to graduates with disabilities. It is recognised that a disproportionate number of graduates with a disability encounter difficulties at the transitional stage between graduation and employment since many have not had the opportunity of a summer work placement, despite qualifying in a broad range of disciplines such as business, economics, social science, law, engineering, commerce, education and science. Offering placements to third level students has already proved to be a good way of highlighting the benefits of the Civil Service as an employer to prospective graduates. The WAM project will help promote the Civil Service as an employer of choice, as well as giving practical effect to Government and Civil Service policy on improving employment prospects for people with disabilities.</P>

I expect to be in a position shortly to determine the best strategy, having regard to the many and complex issues involved, to give effect to the programme for Government commitment to the payment of the maintenance grants through a unified and flexible payment scheme. Whatever new arrangements are eventually decided upon will, as I have previously indicated, be provided for in new statutory arrangements through a student support Bill. I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval in the near future for the drafting of the Bill.</P>

        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools, serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage, have been invited to participate in the new school support programme. These comprise 640 primary schools &mdash; 320 urban-town schools and 320 rural schools &mdash; and 200 second level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;24.7 million has been allocated to the programme for 2006 and school completion programme services will be extended to all 320 urban-town primary schools and 200 second level schools participating in the SSP and not already benefiting from these services with additional clusters created under the school support programme during the school year 2006-07.

	<P>In my reply to Question No. 583 of 14 February 2006 in respect of the availability of a statistical breakdown of grant holders by socio-economic background, I referred to the fact that limited indicative data on the socio-economic background of grantholders have been collected in the past on the higher education grants scheme only. My Department&rsquo;s student support unit is currently in the process of collating information on students who were awarded grants under the higher education grants scheme for the academic year 2004-05 from the returns which have been submitted to date by the local authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately a number of returns are outstanding for 2002-03 and 2003-04 which the Department is currently pursuing with the local <Col N="1516"/>authorities and the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association. Despite this and to avoid any further delay, we are arranging to have the available data provided to the Deputy directly. It is our intention that this information will issue to the Deputy in the coming days in respect of 2002-03 and 2003-04. This indicative data are subject to considerable qualification in relation to their reliability due to, <i>inter alia</i>, the level of undeclared status amongst the returns from the local authorities.</P>
        <P>Following consultations with the Irish Vocational Education Association, new arrangements were introduced in 2005 to compile a more comprehensive statistical breakdown of grantholders under the schemes administered by the VECs. This complements arrangements in place in respect of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that the information in respect of the 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05 academic years was unavailable to the Deputy following the previous parliamentary question. When the complete returns for the academic years 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05 are available, the information will be made available to the Deputy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in my statement on the publication of the Estimates for 2006, extra funding is being made available to the primary school management bodies. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the funding being provided to Educate Together is being increased to &euro;120,000. This represents an almost threefold increase over the level of the grant allocation for this body under the 2005 Estimates provision.</P>
        <P>In making its case for funding to me Educate Together also raised the issue for support for newly establishing schools. To support such schools I am introducing a new grant of &euro;10,000 payable in two instalments of &euro;5,000 for the boards of management of newly establishing schools in respect of training of the boards of management and staff in their initial years. Schools established in the 2004-05 school year and which are now in their second year of operation will receive &euro;5,000 as a training grant for boards of management. Those established in the current school year will qualify for both instalments of the grant. The new grant is in addition to the existing start-up grant of &euro;6,348.69 which has been available to all new primary schools which began operating from 1 September 2000.</P><Col N="1517"/>
        <P>As a further measure to assist new schools I will be authorising the earlier appointment of principal teachers in these schools to assist in the establishment phase. Discussions on the arrangements to apply for the implementation of this initiative are ongoing between my Department and the relevant interests.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I asked officials, in respect of Educate Together&rsquo;s ethical education programme, to establish a working group to explore with Educate Together and the colleges of education the best means of ensuring that training in this area can be provided to students studying to become primary school teachers.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my officials have contacted the Conference of Heads of Irish Colleges of Education, CHoICE, to progress the matter and a meeting has been arranged with them to, among other things, formally establish this Working Group. This meeting will take place over the coming weeks. The colleges are well aware of the issues surrounding Educate Together&rsquo;s ethical education programme and they have indicated their willingness to assist the work of the group. In addition, my officials are due to meet with the chief executive officer of Educate Together in the coming weeks to progress the matter.</P>
        <P>My Department has supported the establishment of a significant number of new multi-denominational schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years alone, 12 are multi-denominational.</P>
        <P>To underpin the establishment of new schools, my Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have assisted patron bodies in the provision of accommodation. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by the patron body for multi-denominational schools, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster &mdash; such as in the case of the new multi-denominational school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in less than 13 months.</P>
        <P>Standard-generic designs have also been developed by the building unit of my Department for eight and 16-classroom schools. It is expected that use of these designs, wherever possible, will yield a substantial savings in terms of design team fees as well as reducing the time taken to bring new school projects to completion.</P>
        <P>Many multi-denominational primary schools are established in areas of rapidly expanding population growth. School building projects in these areas are assigned a band one rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. This is the highest band rating possible which results in the delivery of perma<Col N="1518"/>nent accommodation in the shortest timeframe achievable. Pending the delivery of new school buildings, my Department contributes 95% towards the cost of rental of temporary accommodation for schools with permanent recognition. The local contribution for a school in such circumstances is capped at &euro;3,175 per annum.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the range of measures now being introduced, including the almost threefold increase in its grant, provides a comprehensive response to the request made for additional support for Educate Together and its schools.</P>

	<P>All schools in the mid-western region have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, that is administered by NEPS. Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist directly the fees for this assessment. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. NEPS also provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for reasonable accommodations in certificate examinations.</P>
        <P>The number of psychologists in NEPS has increased from 43 on establishment to 122 at present. The NEPS development plan drawn up in the year 2000 envisaged that up to 16 psychologists would be needed at full development strength to provide a psychological service to all schools in the mid-western region serving counties Limerick, Clare and Tipperary North Riding. Currently, there are five NEPS psychologists working in the mid-western region and 11 posts are vacant.</P>
        <P>The Public Appointments Service recently concluded a new recruitment competition for the appointment of educational psychologists to NEPS and regional panels have been established to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need.

	<P>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. Notwithstanding this, I have made inquiries with the SEC on the matter raised by the Deputy and I am advised as follows.</P>
        <P>The revision of draft marking schemes is a normal part of the process which applies to every subject. Each year, following the examinations, the chief examiner and his or her advising team prepare a draft marking scheme for each subject. A meeting of the relevant examiners is convened, and the draft marking scheme is explained and discussed at this marking conference. The effectiveness of the marking scheme is then tested by putting it into action on a random sample of candidates&rsquo; work. When this process is completed the final marking scheme is prepared.</P>
        <P>Changes may be made to the draft scheme in the light of feedback from examiners, advice from advising or senior examiners, or certain trends associated with the spread of the grades. The review of the marking scheme that applies to every subject after the initial sampling is a normal part of the marking process. This is one of the ways to ensure quality control, ensuring that there is uniformity both in the scheme and among the various markers.</P>
        <P>In the case of higher level Irish in the leaving certificate in 2005, the review of the draft marking scheme highlighted the need for a number of changes, and a diagnostic test was carried out on some exam scripts before a final decision was taken regarding the definitive marking scheme. All examiners had 50 scripts marked at this stage and many had more than that number completed. The final marking scheme was applied to all candidates, requiring the remarking of the scripts marked earlier, and the examiners were paid the standard fee for this in line with normal practice. Marks were awarded on the basis of the criteria in the final marking scheme.</P>
        <P>The leaving certificate examination operates in a transparent manner which is to the forefront of international practice. Marking schemes are published, and candidates are given the opportunity to view their scripts before deciding whether to appeal their grade. There is also provision for a comprehensive appeals process. With regard to leaving certificate Irish at higher level in 2005, 0.9% of candidates scored at grades E, F and no grade. This compares with a figure of 0.6% in 2004, 1.4% in 2003 and 0.7% in 2002.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to funding the provision of PE, general purpose and outdoor play areas in schools as part of the school building and modernisation programme. This is being addressed in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects.</P>
        <P>The provision of PE halls at post-primary level is considered an integral part of the design stage for any major refurbishment programme of existing school buildings &mdash; providing always that the site is of sufficient size &mdash; or where a new school on a greenfield site is being built. The PE hall project at the school referred to by the Deputy has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria. The project is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme for 2006 to 2010.</P>

	<P>The proposed extension project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning and is one of the 124 schools that I announced in April 2005 to progress through the architectural planning process.</P>
        <P>An educational worksheet was returned to my Department in December 2005 and following this a schedule of overall accommodation was completed by a member of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate. In February this year my Department&rsquo;s officials visited the school in question and schedules of suggested future use of the existing accommodation, with a schedule of residual accommodation, were completed.</P>
        <P>On 20 March a letter issued to the school authorities with the revised schedules requesting them to get their design team to revise the original stage 1 as presented to the Department in October 2001 to reflect the impact of the revised schedules. When this information is forwarded to my Department, my officials will be in further contact with the school authorities as to the next steps involved in progressing this project. Progression of projects to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme for 2006 to 2010.</P>

	<P>Expenditure on rental of temporary school premises, which includes the cost of renting prefabricated buildings, in 2005 was &euro;15.75 million.</P>
        <P>The breakdown of costs is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy as the financial records which are maintained in respect of payments made to school authorities for rented temporary accommodation are recorded on a monthly basis and are not recorded on a county basis. However, if the Deputy wishes to request details on the annual cost of rented school accommodation in a specific school or county, my officials will provide the required information.</P>
        <P>The expenditure on rental of prefabricated buildings represented less than 3.2% of the total expenditure of &euro;501 million on school buildings in the same period. The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly <Col N="1527"/>in recent years, mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers, particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
        <P>The current focus within my Department is on empowering schools to resolve their accommodation needs by way of permanent accommodation wherever possible. To reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. The feedback from the 20 schools in that pilot initiative was very positive and the initiative was expanded to 44 primary schools in 2004. Over 70 schools were invited to participate in the initiative in 2005 and 75 schools were invited to participate in what is now known as the permanent accommodation scheme in 2006.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrol<Col N="1528"/>ment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 187 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule, Circular No. 0023 of 2006, which has issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006-07 school year will be a principal and seven mainstream class teachers. Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 248 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule, Circular No. 0023 of 2006, which has issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006-07 school year will be a principal and nine mainstream class teachers. Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular No. 0024 of 2006, Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has invested in the largest school building programme in the history of the State. Between 1998 and the end of 2004, almost &euro;2 billion was invested in school buildings and in the region of 7,500 large and small projects were completed in schools, including 130 brand new schools and 510 large-scale refurbishments or extensions. Funding for schools building and renovation projects has increased fivefold since 1997. In 2006, &euro;491 million will be spent on school building projects, compared to just &euro;92 million in 1997. This, in its own right, is an increase of over 9% in real terms on the 2005 allocation.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, at the end of last year I outlined my spending plans for primary and post-primary schools for 2006. With &euro;491 million to be spent on schools buildings, there will be over 1,300 projects active in schools all over the country. This significant investment will allow me to continue to progress our major programme of school building and modernisation which includes improving equipment needed for new technologies and ICT.</P>
        <P>I have already started to outline individual schools around the country that will benefit under the various parts of the programme throughout the year with the announcement of 62 schools that have been given the go-ahead to start architectural planning, 740 schools that are being given funding under the summer works scheme to carry out essential small-scale projects and 210 primary schools that will receive approval for devolved funding under the small school and permanent accommodation initiatives during the coming year. This is in addition to the 153 schools that will have projects at construction during 2006 under these initiatives.</P>
        <P>Small school and permanent accommodation initiatives, which were piloted over the past two years, will become a permanent feature of the building programme. This will enable schools to get works done faster by allowing them to run the projects themselves.</P>
        <P>I will announce details of the other aspects of the programme as we move through the year. The principal features of the 2006 building and modernisation programme include: &euro;277 million to be targeted at primary schools and &euro;204 million in the post-primary sector; almost 200 major school building projects to be at construction during 2006, with 105 primary school projects and 62 post-primary projects advancing in architectural <Col N="1533"/>design; and the further use of fast-track design solutions for primary schools.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>It is expected that up to 12 primary schools will be built using a standardised design model or a design and build process. The first school built under this model opened in Balgaddy, Lucan, in September 2005, having taken just ten months to build.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 561 and 562 together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special educational needs, SEN, into ordinary mainstream schools. Where mainstream provision is not appropriate children can be catered for in special schools that are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are 106 special schools in the country. These schools cater for children from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio and other staffing supports. Additional special needs assistant, SNA, support is provided if deemed necessary. Special schools also receive increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
        <P>Children with SEN can also attend special classes attached to certain ordinary mainstream schools. All special classes enjoy the same increased levels of staffing and funding as are made available to the special schools. Children with SEN attending special classes attached to ordinary schools may also, where appropriate, be integrated into ordinary classes for periods of the school day.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a general allocation scheme has been introduced under which main<Col N="1534"/>stream primary schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence SEN such as dyslexia, and those with learning support needs. All schools were notified of their general allocation for the 2005-06 school year last May.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, is responsible for processing applications from schools for special needs supports such as resource teaching hours and SNA support for children with low-incidence SEN, based on applications in respect of individual pupils. Once a school has been advised of its general allocation and the SENO has allocated hours and SNA support, if appropriate, in respect of pupils with low incidence SEN, it is a matter for the school authority to recruit the relevant staff.</P>
        <P>There has been enormous progress in recent years in increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with SEN. At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>In the area of second level provision, my Department provides a range of supports for second level schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs transferring from primary level. The supports in question include learning support and resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment. At second level, approximately 1,653 whole-time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to approximately 200 teachers in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole-time equivalent learning support teachers.</P>
        <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or SNA support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P>Enormous progress has also been made in increasing the number of SNAs in our schools who specifically cater for the care needs of children with special educational needs. There are over 7,300 whole-time equivalent SNAs in primary and second level schools supporting chil<Col N="1535"/>dren with special needs. I confirm that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special educational needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>
        <P>I advise the Deputy that responsibility for the provision of therapy services rests with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The areas to which the Deputy refers, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in the areas in question. The following is an outline of the measures undertaken by my Department to ensure that there are adequate places available in these areas to meet demand.</P>
        <P>In the Naas locality, at primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee, while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corb&aacute;in, St. Conleth&rsquo;s and St. Mary&rsquo;s national school and St. Conleth&rsquo;s Naofa. Temporary accommodation has also been approved at Caragh national school, St. Corban&rsquo;s national school, Gaelscoil N&aacute;s na R&iacute;ogh and Scoil Naomh Brighde. A brand new state-of-the-art 16-classroom school, together with a double autistic unit, was also opened this September in Naas town. This project, in particular, will assist in easing any difficulties for primary pupil places in Naas. Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David&rsquo;s national school and Two Mile House national school. The long-term accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Caragh and the Convent of Mercy are also being assessed.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level, the management authority of St. Patrick&rsquo;s post-primary school, County Kildare VEC is progressing plans to relocate the school and extend capacity to 1,000 pupil places. Additionally, an extension project is under construction at St. Mary&rsquo;s College, which will increase capacity at the school to 900 pupils. A similar extension is under construction at Me&aacute;nscoil Iogn&aacute;id R&iacute;s and further accommodation needs at the school are in planning.</P>
        <P>In Clane, in 2004, St. Patrick&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; school was given capital funding which enabled the school to build two mainstream classrooms and three resource rooms. The school authority recently applied for further additional accommodation. At post-primary level, Clane community school has applied for additional accommodation. Both applications are currently being assessed in the school planning section of my Department.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above and as the Deputy will be aware, following widespread local consul<Col N="1536"/>tation, my Department recently published an area development plan for the N4-M4 corridor. This plan covers the area from Leixlip to Kilbeggan and includes Kilcock, Celbridge and Maynooth. The plan outlines my Department&rsquo;s long-term educational strategy at both primary and post-primary level for these areas and the implementation of the recommendations in the plan is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2006 onwards subject to the prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.</P>
        <P>In Kilcock an extension project at Gaelscoil U&iacute; Riada is under way and the extension project at Gaelscoil Choca Naofa has been approved to commence architectural planning this year. At post-primary level an extension project at Scoil Dara was recently completed which has increased capacity to 875 pupils.</P>
        <P>In Maynooth a new 16-classroom school is to be provided for Scoil U&iacute; Fhiaich. The project has been approved to commence architectural planning this year. An extension project at Maynooth Presentation Convent is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.</P>
        <P>Other schools in these areas are also being examined to ensure that the existing accommodation is adequate to meet the current and future needs of the area. All of these initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my Department&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned. The school planning section of my Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</P>

	<P>The primary pupil-teacher ratio for the 2004-05 school year in County Kildare was 20.2:1.

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has dramatically improved staffing in primary schools throughout the country, including Kildare. As well as reducing average class size, the putting in place of over 5,000 extra primary teachers in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under DEIS, Developing Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion launched last May, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 180 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place this term, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in the area in recent years.</P>
        <P>At the time of the 2006 Estimates, I announced that I had secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and that the Minister for Finance had committed himself to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the 2006-07 and 2007-08 school years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and tackle disadvantage. That will be done by changing the staffing schedule. As the Deputy will be aware, the mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, which is issued annually to all primary schools.</P>
        <P>The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year that is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher, and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special <Col N="1538"/>needs.

	<P>The primary pupil-teacher ratio for the 2004-05 school year in County Kildare was 20.2:1.

	<P>Information on the number of classes <Col N="1540"/>of over 30 pupils in the current school year is not yet available in my Department.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving staffing in primary schools has been unprecedented. We have put over 5,000 more primary teachers in our schools in the last few years. Those have been targeted at pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas to ensure that they are getting the extra help that they need to reach their potential. That has resulted in a major improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio, which counts all the teachers in a school, including special needs teachers, school principals, etc. In 1997 the pupil-teacher ratio was 22:1, meaning that there was one teacher for every 22 primary school children in our schools. By 2004-05 we had reduced that to 17:1, or one teacher for every 17 pupils.</P>
        <P>The average class size nationally has also been reduced to 23.9, while significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools, with approximately 47,000 pupils in 243 schools participating in the Giving Children an Even Break &mdash; Breaking the Cycle programme, benefitting from reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.</P>
        <P>Under the new action plan for tackling disadvantage published last May, more children in disadvantaged schools will be in smaller classes in the current school year. With the more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before.</P>
        <P>In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done that and now in line with the Government commitment mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that the system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department Primary Circular 19-02, which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the first meeting of the appeals board will be held in May. Further meetings will be held in July and October. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 12 May, 24 June and 18 October, respectively. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the cri<Col N="1541"/>terion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from primary payments section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and my Department, and its decision is final.</P>

	<P>Government commitment to the PLC sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers&rsquo; pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is very significant. The Government&rsquo;s support for this very important sector is clear from the fact that we have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996-97. The number of PLC places approved for 2005-06 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004-05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188.</P>
        <P>We also extended the provision of maintenance grants to PLC students with effect from September 1998. The PLC maintenance grants scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education. There were nearly 8,000 PLC grant-holders in 2005, and they received some &euro;23 million in direct support. Tuition fees for PLC courses are also waived.</P>
        <P>PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs. A supplementary non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. That amounted to &euro;5.5 million in 2005.</P><Col N="1542"/>
        <P>Other developments funded by my Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the institutes of technology.</P>
        <P>The McIver report contains 21 overarching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations. It has been estimated, in consultation with management and staff interests, that the recommendations for staffing would involve at a minimum the creation of at least 800 new posts at a cost of over &euro;48 million. That level of additional provision cannot be considered in isolation from other areas of education.</P>
        <P>In their consideration of the future needs of the PLC sector, my officials have been examining, <i>inter alia</i>, the non-teaching educational tasks particular to PLC teachers, the demands on the management side and the challenges presented by the variation in size of the more than 200 PLC providers.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department recently met representatives of management. Among the many topics discussed at that meeting was the needs of the PLC sector. Further discussions with management and also the union side will be necessary. The timing and extent of implementation will depend on the outcomes of those discussions.</P>

	<P>Primary schools&rsquo; running costs are met by my Department&rsquo;s scheme of capitation grants. The grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools. The capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. The standard rate of capitation grant increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;133.58 with effect from 1 January 2005, and it has been further increased by &euro;12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2006, bringing the standard rate to &euro;145.58. That represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</P>

	<P>The Easter Rising of 1916 will be commemorated by a military parade in Dublin on Sunday, 16 April. Preparations for the parade, as announced by the Taoiseach last October, are being made by the Defence Forces. Approximately 2,500 personnel representing all branches of the forces, together with representatives of ex-service personnel and veterans of UN service, will be included. The parade will also include members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, representing their service abroad with the United Nations. A fly-past by the Air Corps is also envisaged.</P>
        <P>A total of 60 military vehicles are scheduled to participate in the parade. The vehicles selected are drawn from all corps and formations and are representative of the equipment in use in the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces&rsquo; record of service with the United Nations will be marked by the carrying of flags of all nations in which Defence Force Personnel have served on UN duty. The unit colours of all military units of the Defence Forces that were deployed overseas will also be carried. A representative group of approximately 150 personnel from the Irish United Nations Veterans Association will march in the parade.</P>
        <P>The parade will depart from Dublin Castle, passing through Dame Street, College Green and O&rsquo;Connell Street. There will be a reading of the proclamation outside the GPO, and appropriate military honours will be rendered. The event will be televised live, and it will be possible to view the parade along the route from Dublin Castle to O&rsquo;Connell Street.</P>
        <P>This 90th anniversary of the rising will also be marked by a wreath-laying ceremony in Kilmainham Gaol earlier that morning and by a Government reception at Dublin Castle that evening.</P>
        <P>Officials of my Department and officers of the Defence Forces are represented on an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, which is overseeing all the logistical arrangements for the parade and associated events. That group meets regularly and includes, <i>inter alia</i>, representatives from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council, the fire services and the Office of Public Works. As the Deputy will appreciate, many logistical issues such as the parade route, road closures, health and safety regulations, publicity, etc., have to be addressed, as well as the security arrangements for the event, and the group is dealing with them.</P>

        <P>The definition of a person with a disability for the purposes of the 3% target is the positive action definition set out in the Code Of Practice for the Civil Service, 1994. In that context, the term &ldquo;people with disabilities&rdquo; means people with a physical, sensory or psychological impairment which may: &ldquo;have a tangible impact on their functional capability to do a particular job; or have an impact on their ability to function in a particular physical environment; or lead to a discrimination in obtaining or keeping employment of a kind for which they would otherwise be suited.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>The Phosphorus Regulations National Implementation Report 2005 was published by the EPA on 22 March 2006. The Government is committed to tackling water pollution from all sources, and the report identifies a general improvement in compliance levels with the regulations, which has increased by 3.4% since the mid-1990s, to the current 63.4% compliance rate nationally.</P>
        <P>The improvements in recent years can be attributed to several factors, including some reduction in agricultural inputs owing to improved farm practices and improved investment in wastewater infrastructure under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment proposal. However, agriculture remains the most significant source of nutrient pollution of waters, representing some 73% of all phosphorus and 82% of all nitrates input to waters; there remains the need to tackle agricultural source pollution on a broad, systematic basis. The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Waters) Regulations 2005, which give legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s nitrates action programme, came into effect generally on 1 February 2006. The regulations apply to all farms. Progress will be monitored on an ongoing basis by reference to water quality and agricultural practices.</P>
        <P>With regard to local authority services, some &euro;2 billion has been invested under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme on the provision of new and upgraded wastewater infrastructure since 2000. That has made a significant contribution to the protection and improvement of Ireland&rsquo;s water quality and has resulted in provision of secondary wastewater treatment capacity for a population equivalent of 3 million, seven times more than under the previous national development plan; an increase from 25% to 90% in Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the treatment standards required under the EU urban wastewater treatment directive; and a reduction of 45,000 tonnes per annum, or 123,000 kg per day, in the volume of polluting discharges to river, lake and sea waters.</P>
        <P>Where new municipal wastewater infrastructure is required to resolve identified pollution problems, proposals by local authorities are given a high priority under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am confident that we are tackling the issue of water quality on a broad front and that we will see significant improvements in water quality in the coming years.</P>

	<P>Compensation through the purchase by agreement of the turbary rights or of the full title of the designated bogs has now been paid in almost 400 cases. The procedure involves the preparation of a contract for sale by the vendor&rsquo;s solicitor and the processing of that contract, including, <i>inter alia</i>, proof of legal title, through the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office. Subject to that sometimes time-consuming procedure, my Department will seek to advance purchases from, and payments to, landowners as quickly as possible regarding both current and future land acquisitions.</P>

	<P>The Coole sewerage scheme is included in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-07 as a scheme to advance through planning at an estimated cost of &euro;3.08 million.</P>
        <P>My Department is awaiting some additional information requested from Westmeath County Council regarding the council&rsquo;s preliminary report and water services pricing policy report for the scheme. Following approval of the preliminary report, the council will be in a position to advance the scheme to construction without further reference to my Department in accordance with the revised procurement procedures that I have recently introduced under the water <Col N="1547"/>services investment programme for schemes costing less than &euro;5 million.</P>
        <P>In April 2005 my Department conveyed approval to Westmeath County Council to proceed with the Castletown-Geoghegan sewerage scheme, an independent project. That had previously been part of a pilot programme to test new, small-scale wastewater treatment systems. The scheme is being funded under my Department&rsquo;s devolved rural water programme. It is, accordingly, a matter for the council to arrange for the invitation of tenders and the commencement of work.</P>

	<P>The report of the working group which was established to review the management of dog breeding establishments was submitted to me on 7 September 2005. The report contains a number of recommendations, including recommendations on the introduction of statutorily enforceable standards for the dog breeding industry in Ireland, and proposes the introduction of a registration system for dog breeding establishments. However, three of the members of the working group disagreed with the main recommendations and submitted three separate minority reports. It was in the light of those divergent views that I decided to canvass public opinion more widely before taking final <Col N="1548"/>decisions on the matter. An advertisement inviting submissions was placed in the national newspapers on Monday, 24 October 2005 and the closing date for receipt of submissions was Friday, 16 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The responses received, which also represent a range of different views, are at an advanced stage of examination in the Department and, as soon as this exercise is completed, I will consider further the recommendations in the report of the working group. I will determine an appropriate response within the next two months.</P>

	<P>The information sought in the question would not normally be compiled by the Department. On 25 January, the Department issued circular letter PD 1/06 to planning authorities reminding them of their obligations under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in taking in charge estates.</P>
        <P>The circular letter also directed each planning authority to submit a report to the Department setting out how it is performing in the taking in charge of estates. A total of 31 planning authorities have now submitted these reports. As the table below shows, these planning authorities report that they anticipate taking in charge 388 housing estates in 2006, affecting 18,924 houses. As the table also shows, these planning authorities report that there are 1,413 housing estates not yet taken in charge, for which planning permission expired more than two years ago, affecting 52,062 houses.</P><Col N="1549"/>

	<P>Substantial progress continues to be made on delivering the 10,000 housing units promised under the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative. Over 70 projects on State and local authority lands are planned which, <Col N="1550"/>together with the projected 2,500 housing units under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2004, gives over the 10,000 housing unit target figure that was proposed by the parties to the pay agreement.</P>
        <P>The information requested on the exact location, potential numbers of housing units and the current status of each development under the initiative is set out in the following table. In addition to these, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has released a series of Health Service Executive lands to the initiative which have the potential to realise 1,400 housing units. These lands are being examined by the relevant local authorities to determine their suitability for affordable housing.</P>
        <P>The qualifying criteria for applicants under the initiative are broadly similar to the arrangements which apply under Part V. Individuals are eligible to apply for housing units under the initiative where the cost of servicing a mortgage on a market value house in the area would exceed 35% of their net disposable income. </P><Col N="1549"/>

        <P>The Dunmore and Kilkerrin sewerage schemes are approved for funding in the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-07 under the rural towns and villages initiative. The treatment plants for both schemes are being procured as a single design-build-operate contract that also includes Leenane. Galway County Council&rsquo;s revised tender documents for the treatment plants and water services pricing policy report for the three locations were received in the Department in January and are being dealt with as quickly as possible. Approval of the tender documents will allow the council to invite tenders for the construction of the treatment plants from a panel of short-listed contractors already in place.</P>
        <P>I approved Galway County Council&rsquo;s tender recommendations for the construction of the collection networks for both schemes by way of a single contract in September 2005. The network in Kilkerrin is substantially complete and the works are under way in Dunmore.</P>

	<P>The level of low cost site subsidy provided by the Department for a local authority under the low cost site scheme varies from location to location depending on factors, including the acquisition and development costs of the sites. The price at which the local authority intends to sell such sites to housing applicants is a matter to be determined by individual local authorities. The sale of such sites to individuals is subject to phased clawback arrangements designed to prevent short-term profiteering by owners of subsidised sites.</P>
        <P>The clawback arrangements do not apply to sites provided under the scheme to voluntary, co-operative and other non-profit housing groups as houses constructed by these bodies are not provided for sale.

	<P>Responsibility for the operation of the rural water programme, including the prioritisation, approval and payment of grants to group schemes, has been devolved to county councils since 1997. I have provided an overall block grant allocation of &euro;2.327 million to Kildare County Council under the 2006 rural water programme, an increase of 41% on the council&rsquo;s expenditure last year.</P>
        <P>Kildare County Council requested an allocation of &euro;1.541 million for 11 new group water schemes, three at construction and eight at pre-tender stage, in the 2006 rural water programme proposals submitted to the Department in December 2005. The council indicated that no funding would be required for the Ballyna scheme until 2007 as it is dependent on prior commissioning of new wellfields and completion of trunk mains under the Kildare water supply strategy, phase 1.</P>
        <P>I have approved an allocation of &euro;1 million under this measure of the rural water programme for the current year which I expect will be sufficient to meet all likely expenditure. However, as in previous years, I will consider making, from any savings elsewhere, increased <Col N="1562"/>allocations to councils where progress is ahead of schedule.</P>

	<P>It is a requirement of water pricing policy that the cost of providing water services for the non-domestic sector <Col N="1563"/>should be fully recovered by local authorities by means of a meter based volumetric charge. This is an equitable approach which promotes maximum environmental efficiency and also incentivises non-domestic users, including schools, to conserve their use of water.

        <P>I had very useful and informal discussions with Environment Commissioner Dimas during his visit to Ireland last month on a wide range of issues, including that referred to in the question. It would not be appropriate for me to disclose the detail of these discussions, which were without prejudice to any legal proceedings that may continue between Ireland and the European Commission. </P>
