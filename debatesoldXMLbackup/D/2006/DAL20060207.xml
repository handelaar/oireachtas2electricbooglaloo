	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report the information requested by the Deputies on the statistics regarding freedom of information requests received in my Department.</P>
        <P>In 2005, a total of &euro;780 was collected in fees in respect of 52 applications. A further &euro;225 was collected in respect of internal review fees for three applications and &euro;35 was collected for search and retrieval fees in respect of one application. The Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 established an independent process for consideration of freedom of information requests. I have no role in how the provisions of the Acts are applied in specific instances. While I am pleased to provide general statistical information <Col N="3"/>about the operation of freedom of information in my Department, it would be inappropriate for me to discuss the outcome of specific requests or to answer questions about how the provisions were <Col N="4"/>applied in any specific area. To do so would undermine the independence of decision makers and may be prejudicial to the conduct of the appeals processes provided for in the Acts. </P><Col N="3"/>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of the Taoiseach must, like any other Department, be subject to various inspections, including those investigations by the Health and Safety Authority, if necessary. Why did the Information Commissioner report that a member of the public had had to let her know that the scope of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 had been changed? Why is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department excluded from any inspection or investigation by the Health and Safety Authority that might be warranted? I understand that the Information Commissioner is to highlight that all new legislation apparently includes growing numbers of non-disclosure provisions that will affect the Department of the Taoiseach among others. That is neither transparent, progressive nor in keeping with the stated Government aim of being open and accountable in all its affairs. Regarding those three elements of change&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions on the legislation should be addressed to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The questions referred specifically to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that, but I am asking the Taoiseach whether he was aware that the Freedom of Information Act 1997 had been changed to exclude Health and Safety Authority investigations in his Department. Why did a member of the public have to tell the Information Commissioner that? Is the Taoiseach happy that there now appears to be evidence of a growing number of non-disclosure provisions in legislation? That is not good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To the best of my knowledge, it is the other way around. I do not know whether the change has yet occurred, but another long list of bodies was to be made subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Regarding health and safety issues, I am not aware of any change. Whatever was the position remains such. The Health and Safety Authority, if it was ever on the list, remains so. It has not been removed from it. I will check for the Deputy regarding my Department, but I am certainly not aware of any change. <Col N="6"/>For example, if someone tabled a question on health and safety issues in my Department, I cannot understand why it might go unanswered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Information Commissioner said in that regard that the circumstances through which her office had become aware of the amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 were highly unsatisfactory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question refers specifically to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and so does this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Deputy submit his question to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This refers specifically to the Department of the Taoiseach which, like all the others, is now excluded by changes to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 from Health and Safety Authority investigations. That was not brought to the attention of the Information Commissioner but, according to her comments, made known to her by a member of the public. That is not good enough, and she also mentions an increasing number of non-disclosure provisions. While the Taoiseach refers to the growing list of bodies included in the Act, the Information Commissioner refers to a significant number outside its remit, including the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question should be raised with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There are also 33 vocational education committees. As with the Department of the Taoiseach, why is it taking so long for those to be rolled out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise from these questions, and the Deputy knows that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>With due respect, the Department of the Taoiseach is now excluded from Health and Safety Authority investigations. The Act was changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question has already been raised and dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but it has not been answered. I have drawn to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention the fact that the Information Commissioner herself has said that this was changed without her knowledge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to raise the matter with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important element of Government competence and transparency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why it should be dealt with properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but it affects the Department of the Taoiseach. I am asking him a question, and the Ceann Comhairle is trying to rule me out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is doing his damnedest to rule me out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to rule the Deputy out of order because he knows that questions on the Freedom of Information Act 1997 are a matter for the Minister for Finance. This question deals specifically with the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and my question is if the Act has been changed to exclude the Department of the Taoiseach from Health and Safety Authority investigations without the Commissioner&rsquo;s knowledge, the change later being brought to her attention by a member of the public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has already raised that question. I call the Taoiseach on the question relating to his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Information Commissioner has said that this was a most unsatisfactory way to proceed with business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, I will check for the Deputy whether there has been any change in processing health and safety queries from the inception of Act. I do not believe that there has been. If someone asked regarding health and safety in my Department, I cannot imagine why he or she should be refused the information. My reply to the next question will contain information on what is covered by health and safety issues in the Disability Act. I do not understand <Col N="8"/>there is any secret about that or that it would not come within the normal issues of security or court matters or any of the matters that are excluded from the Act. I will check for the Deputy on whether there has been any change but I do not think there has been.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach recall that during the recess it was reported that requests made to his Department under the Freedom of Information Act regarding the use of Shannon Airport by the US military and related matters, were refused? Will the Taoiseach advise if such a request or requests were refused and if they were refused under section 24 of the Act? Will the Taoiseach agree that section 24 allows for refusal of information if a head of a Department believes access to the information could adversely affect the security of the State, the defence of the State, international relations or matters pertaining to the Six Counties area of our country? Under which of these headings did the refusals fall and did any of them relate to the Six Counties? Does the Taoiseach agree with the Information Commissioner that the FOI law has become too restrictive and that it is very much against the public interest that information sought on projects involving major public expenditure &mdash; of which there are several examples&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a question for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This question is in the context of the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s commentary. I am merely asking a question about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position on this matter and whether he shares the view. I was just giving examples of matters relating to public spending.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to deal with the questions before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already asked the Taoiseach a number of questions. With regard to the comments by the Information Commissioner, I ask whether the Taoiseach has any view regarding the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s commentary, particularly regarding matters of major public expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Information Commissioner produces an annual report which is examined in detail by the Department of Finance and by an interdepartmental group. I am not involved in the process.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked a question concerning section 24 of the Act which provides protection for records whose disclosure would reasonably be expected to damage the security of the State, defence of the State, international relations and matters relating to Northern Ireland. The security <Col N="9"/>of the State would have been the reason such requests were disallowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of the Taoiseach in common with every other Department imposes fees for requests under the freedom of information legislation. Is the Taoiseach aware the European Commission would regard Ireland as being out of line on that matter? I refer to fees of &euro;15, &euro;75 and a fee of &euro;150 if the matter is appealed to the Information Commissioner under section 7 of the Act. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that a decrease of 32% over the 2003 figures for requests under FOI is a healthy sign?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I prefer the Deputy to deal with the questions before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to the freedom of information legislation which is the subject of these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The fees are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s opinion on the matter because it applies to his Department. Is the Taoiseach minded to extend the number of bodies subject to the freedom of information legislation following the meeting of the committee on 15 February, considering that 150 bodies are excluded from the freedom of information legislation? Does that not give further credence to the belief that there is a culture of secrecy in Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised the issue of fees before and we have examined the matter in other jurisdictions. There is a range of fees in other jurisdictions, particularly for appeals. If it concerns a personal matter there is no fee here, otherwise a fee of &euro;15 applies, which is a modest sum. It is estimated that the average administrative cost of processing an application is &euro;425, so the fee is small by comparison. I do not think it has anything to do with the early flow of requests in the first case. With regard to an appeal, while a preliminary judgment is given, a person can withdraw right up to that stage and get the fee back. It is only if it goes all the way to a final appeal, which is not usually much different from the preliminary one, that the fee is payable. Therefore, I do not think the fee is excessive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Following my earlier questioning, the Taoiseach acknowledged that at least one question was refused by his Department under section 24 of the Freedom of Information Act. Will he advise us how many questions have been refused over the 12 month period from January to December 2005 under section 24 of that Act? Will the Taoiseach advise us also in what way the security of the State would be compromised by the release of the information <Col N="10"/>sought? Is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer not tantamount to an admission on his part that the very fact that the US military continues to use the Shannon Airport facility is, in fact, the compromise of the security of the State? As a result of the questioning and further revelations about Shannon Airport, will the Taoiseach indicate whether he is re-thinking that arrangement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has misunderstood the Act. As I said in my earlier reply, I have no role in the processing of individual applications. I am not consulted on applications that come to my Department, nor am I consulted on replies that emanate from it. It would not be appropriate therefore for me to comment on any individual cases or on specific matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is the head of his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I have no&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>These are questions about his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not. As political head of a Department I have no role whatsoever. The whole purpose and objective of the Freedom of Information Act is that I am neither consulted on what comes in, nor am I consulted on what goes out. That is the way it has been since 1998.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is accountable to this House concerning valid and legitimate questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Ceist a s&eacute;. I call Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is a smoke screening of everything.</P>

	<P>Please allow Deputy Rabbitte to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply to Deputy Kenny about the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s remark that she had been taken by surprise by the exclusion of Health and Safety Authority investigations from the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, is unclear to me. Is the Taoiseach saying that is not the case? This is an important question and I am posing it in the context of, for example, the suggestion by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, that the Health and Safety Authority might take over the role of invigilating standards in industry generally, which is currently done in a more amorphous way by labour inspectors. In that way, they might work to a single authority, rather than creating a new authority. In those circumstances, the exclusion of health and safety investigations from the terms of the freedom of information legislation would <Col N="11"/>not make any sense. The Taoiseach should take this opportunity to clarify the matter. Is he saying the Information Commissioner is wrong and that these matters are not excluded, or is he querying some nuance of that, which I do not understand?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of any change in how health and safety issues have been dealt with. Whatever way they were dealt with in the first place, I understand they are dealt with in the same manner now. I am not aware of what was in the 1997 Act regarding health and safety but if a freedom of information question was asked regarding health and safety, to do with lifts or stairs, or other related disability issues, I cannot understand why that information would not be given by my Department. I am aware of no change in how queries regarding the Health and Safety Act are dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be a note on the file. Otherwise, what was the Information Commissioner talking about when she made her remarks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is absolutely nothing on the file. However, as I said to Deputy Kenny, I will check to see whether there has been a change, but certainly I am not aware of any change in regard to health and safety issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">
          My Department is fully committed to ensuring that the spirit and the letter of this legislation are honoured in the way the Department provides its services. We have for many years been conscious of our duty to ensure access to our buildings and <Col N="12"/>services by people with disabilities. At the time of the adaptation of the building for the Department in the early 1990s, many facilities were provided, which have subsequently been improved upon, and we will continue to review facilities and upgrade them as necessary.</P>
        <P>To fulfil our obligations under the Disability Act 2005, my Department is establishing an implementation monitoring committee, as a sub-committee of the Department&rsquo;s partnership committee. The monitoring committee will give impetus to progressing disability issues in the Department, with particular emphasis on ensuring that the range of services provided by the Department is accessible to people with disabilities and on engaging staff of the Department actively in the process. The committee will report annually to the National Disability Authority and to me as head of the Department on compliance with the 3% target of the employment of people with disabilities. The percentage of staff with disabilities employed in my Department currently is 3.64%.</P>
        <P>The new monitoring committee will review arrangements for providing information to members of the public with disabilities and will establish procedures and set timescales for the provision of information. We will explore possibilities and demand for communications in accessible formats, including use of sign language, braille, audiotapes or any other appropriate method.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. The Disability Act provides for sectoral plans to be drawn up by a number of Departments. Does the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department have an overarching responsibility with regard to the drawing up of these plans and an oversight role with regard to their implementation?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that the Act states that the Minister for Finance may, by order, specify compliance targets relating to the recruitment and employment of persons with disabilities in public bodies, the members of whose staff are civil servants, and the public bodies accountable to the relevant Minister? Has any such order been made with regard to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?</P>
        <P>Given the minimum requirement under the Act for levels of employment of people with disabilities, are higher targets set? I am interested to know the detail with regard to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department is 3%. Will the Taoiseach advise us if that minimum target set out in the Act has been achieved in his Department or have higher targets been set and agreed and, if so, have they been reached? How does his Department compare with other Departments in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department does not have an overarching role with regard to the Disability Act. My Department is one of the Departments <Col N="13"/>which tries to implement aspects of the Act &mdash; every Department has been given responsibilities under the Act. My Department was not one of the sectoral areas. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, works on this issue with the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and a number of other Departments.</P>
        <P>The monitoring committee in my Department is made up of the key people in the Department, including the heads of the IT unit, the personnel office and employment assistance officers, and an access officer. They have responsibilities under the Act and have been given dates for implementation of the various sections of the Act, a number of which have already been put in place.</P>
        <P>We established a committee at the end of last year as part of the partnership process. It reports to the departmental partnership committee and will approve a report on compliance under the Act by each June, by which time the monitoring committee of each Department must report. It also reports to me and the Cabinet committee on social inclusion on compliance with the Act. There are a number of checks and balances to ensure the Act is complied with. The agencies under my responsibility are also involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of employment of people with disabilities in my Department is 3.64%. We make regular returns to the equality division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the 3% target, which happens a number of times per year. We continue to review progress of the target and introduce positive action measures as necessary to try to increase that figure. Under the new Act, the monitoring committee must establish a reporting system to monitor our actions and information on the 3% target and what we are doing to try to achieve and improve on it.</P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office has a figure of 4.39% of staff with disabilities, the State Solicitor&rsquo;s office is at 3.36%, the Law Reform Commission figure is at 4.45% and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General&rsquo;s figures are at 2.3% and 2.59%, respectively, mainly because most of their staff is composed of barristers and solicitors and these figures are based on the proportion of people with disabilities in those professions. The National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, which is a small agency, has no such persons at the moment. It is a small area but NESDO is committed to the figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what constitutes the types of disability he referred to when he mentioned 3.64%? For example, is someone with asthma or tennis elbow regarded as qualifying under that percentage? Will he indicate how many people in that figure are blind or wheelchair users? Can his Department facilitate <Col N="14"/>guide dog users? I wish to get a picture of how that 3.64% is broken down.</P>
        <P>Given that the Disability Act 2005 states that there is an obligation to be proactive in employing people with disabilities, will the Taoiseach say how his Department has demonstrated this approach? Last October, President McAleese launched an excellence in accessibility award. Is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department in the running and would he regard himself as having a Department that qualifies for such an award?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the wording of the Disability Act 2005 needs some reform?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not apply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to stray. Before the Ceann Comhairle cuts me off, the Act states &ldquo;as is practical having regard to its resources&rdquo;. Is this an impediment given that it does not have the strength of requirement that might otherwise be the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The personnel of my Department continuously try to be helpful in assisting and recruiting people with disabilities. Whenever they get the opportunity they try to be helpful in terms of mobility within the Department and its accessibility for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The definition is set out in the 2005 Act:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;[D]isability&rdquo; in relation to a person means a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The code of practice under which the Civil Service works states that people with disabilities refers to those with a physical, sensory or psychological impairment that may have a tangible impact on their functional capability to do a particular job or an impact on their ability to function in a particular physical environment, or lead to discrimination in obtaining or keeping employment of a kind for which they would otherwise be suited. That code is in place across the Civil Service.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Regarding the national disability strategy and related legislation, resources are not an issue. We must now work on targets that have been set to implement key issues, including sectoral plans in the key Departments. My Department is not one of the line Departments in the sectoral plan but it has several other commitments under the Act, for which there are fixed dates. A fixed monitoring committee examines these commitments and there is a fixed process for reporting on them. Resources are being provided to make the necessary implementation possible and to ensure everyone complies with this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach led the presentation of this Bill, with the T&aacute;naiste and five other Ministers, when it was published in 2004. He correctly stated it was a key component of the Government&rsquo;s disability strategy and that it had the capacity to deliver world class services for the disabled. Without being political, the problem is that the strategy is dispensed between seven Departments and no Minister or Department has overall responsibility or accountability. Will the Taoiseach consider this? If seven Departments are dealing with something as important and comprehensive as this strategy, there will be no real sense of ownership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Disability covers several areas. It is mainly dealt with by the Department of Health and Children, but also Social and Family Affairs; Transport; the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The main group working on the national disability strategy comprises the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, with officials from Departments and agencies. This group remains the monitor of the strategy. Each Department must implement its own section of the strategy.</P>
        <P>In my Department there is a monitoring committee and an access office and these fit into the overall partnership process. By certain dates one must report to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on various measures. The strategy is being co-ordinated but each Department must play its part. Dates have been set for implementation. There is co-ordination even though there can never be enough co-ordination when the strategy runs across so many Departments and agencies. There is always a difficulty in that regard but the structure exists and the important point is that people adhere to this.</P>
        <P>Each part should be implemented and people should not wait for a line Department to pressurise them on this point. This is a good cause and it is in everybody&rsquo;s interests to have a disability strategy properly implemented. While various bodies must report to one Department, they should not wait to be ordered to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach read the definition of disability in the legislation, with which I am familiar, but my question sought more specific information. Will the Taoiseach supply figures on the number of people in his Department who are, for example, blind or wheelchair users? A sensory disability is a wide-ranging definition. Someone who requires spectacles could be regarded as having a sensory disability. This definition is as wide as it is long and I would like the Taoiseach to be more specific so we can see the level of interaction with people with disabilities.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="16"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The people who come within the disability category under the Civil Service code have quite a considerable impairment. Not just anyone is put into that category, as the Deputy knows. I can provide him with the breakdown in my Department of the various ailments, without giving individual details. I believe I have given that information previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach advised us that 3.64% was the figure within his Department. Is it a case of the Department having exceeded the base rate of 3% or has a higher target been set which the Department aspires to achieve?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department does not have another target. However, it will take any opportunity to increase the amount. The figure of 3% has been in place for some considerable time. As the number of staff in Departments increases, it is more difficult to achieve that 3%. Departments always try to maintain that figure, and increase it where necessary. People move between Departments through promotions and transfers. The first priority is to remain above the target figure. The Department does not believe it should stop because it has more than 3% and it always attempts to improve on it. Some sections within the Department have more than 4%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 23, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, I met a delegation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 4 January 2006. The meeting was positive and it was agreed that there would be further engagement at official level with a view to finalising a structure on a possible talks process over the following days. Subsequently, the Secretary General of my Department wrote to IBEC, CIF and ICTU outlining possible arrangements for the conduct of any new round of talks on a successor agreement to Sustaining Progress, in particular around the handling of issues regarding employment standards. It was proposed that a multi-stranded approach would be taken to the conduct of the negotiations and that they would commence with an early plenary meeting between the Government and the four pillars of social partnership to launch the negotiations formally.</P>
        <P>In respect of pay and workplace matters, it was proposed that the process of negotiation would reflect the NIB statement of 4 December which <Col N="18"/>recognised the need for urgent engagement on employment standards, displacement, inspection and enforcement, the protection of vulnerable workers from overseas, and related issues raised by congress. This will therefore constitute the first strand of these negotiations. The Government recognises that it is the congress position that significant progress will be made in this first strand regarding employment standards before any substantial engagement takes place around core pay issues. It is proposed that talks with the four pillars on the other strands will commence simultaneously with the employment related strand. Furthermore, as in previous negotiations, another strand of talks around public service modernisation will also be established.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the House that, following the vote in favour of entering negotiations by the SIPTU special delegate conference on 31 January and the decision by the executive council of ICTU on 1 February to accept formally my invitation to enter talks on a new national agreement, I formally launched the negotiations at the plenary meeting of the social partners in Dublin Castle on 2 February.</P>
        <P>The plenary meeting, which was also attended by my colleagues the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for labour affairs provided an opportunity for the Government to set out its priorities for a new agreement and also to hear initial opening statements from the social partners on their priorities for a new agreement. Following on from this, a series of bilateral meetings has got under way. As with previous agreements, the proceedings are subject to normal confidentiality arrangements to protect the negotiating positions of all.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that there are many challenges to be faced in any talks on a new agreement, not least in determining how the area of employment standards should be protected. We believe, however, that the concerns of the social partners on this topic, as on other issues, can best be addressed through a new partnership framework. Social partnership has a proven track record of problem solving, resulting in the radical transformation of our economic and social fortunes since 1987. We believe that with goodwill and determination on all sides, we can negotiate a mutually satisfactory outcome which will deliver further economic and social progress, building on the strong foundations we have already put in place.</P>
        <P>The national implementation body, which includes employer and union representatives, operates under the chairmanship of my Department. Its purpose is to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions of Sustaining Progress. The body met on a number of <Col N="19"/>occasions over recent months to assist in the resolution of industrial relations disputes in both the public and private sectors. In particular, it played a key role in resolving the difficult disputes at An Post and Irish Ferries towards the end of last year. Meetings of the body also provide opportunities for informal discussion of some of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process and the industrial relations climate generally. The body will continue to meet as necessary to this end.</P>
        <P>In December last, the National Economic and Social Council published its three yearly strategic overview of Irish economic and social policy entitled NESC Strategy 2006: People, Productivity and Purpose. The strategy report, as its predecessors did, provides a guiding vision for the coming years for economic and social development in the country and, more immediately, the framework within which the talks will take place.</P>
        <P>In the coming months, other studies will include completion of the study on migration policy, which is well advanced. In 2006, NESC will also complete a report on the Lisbon strategy, focusing on the open method of co-ordination. Further studies nearing completion include a study on child poverty and child income supports that will examine the possibility of merging child benefit allowance and family income supplement.</P>
        <P>During 2006, the council will consider how best to address other items in its current work programme, including taxation policy and competition and regulation in networked sectors. It will also work on its first periodic social report and a significant NESC contribution to a knowledge society foresight exercise.</P>
        <P>The reconstituted NESF held its inaugural meeting on 26 May 2004 in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham at which the work programme for the coming term up to 2006 was discussed, as well as the appropriate structures and working arrangements in the context of the work programme. Early childhood care and education, care for older people and creating a more inclusive labour market were subsequently selected as priority topics. The report on early childhood care and education was published in September last and the reports on care for older people and creating a more inclusive labour market were published recently and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Cultural citizenship and the delivery of public services have been identified for inclusion in the second phase of the work programme. Preliminary work has been undertaken on both these topics and projects in these areas will commence shortly.</P>
        <P>The NESF held the second national anti-poverty strategy social inclusion forum in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on 26 January 2005. The social inclusion forum gives those who are not <Col N="20"/>directly involved in the social partnership process an opportunity to input their views and experiences in implementing the national anti-poverty strategy. A report of these proceedings was published in April 2005.</P>
        <P>The NESF also hosted, in conjunction with UCD, a conference on evidence-based policy making in February 2005. The conference examined the supply and gathering of evidence and applying this in the policy making process and the design of practical policy solutions. The ongoing monitoring and evaluation of policy outcomes was an important focus of the conference.</P>

	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the latest NESF report published yesterday points out that we now have a wealthier society but a more unequal one, with the wealthiest 20% of the working age population earning 12 times more than the lowest paid 20%, the least well off? Does he acknowledge he has repeatedly indicated to this House that he and his Cabinet colleagues take the NESF reports seriously and give them due consideration in the formulation of policy and approach? Would the Taoiseach agree that if he had taken on board what the NESF had said over a number of years, there would not now be such a gap between rich and poor in our society?</P>
        <P>The NESF has repeatedly pointed out measures which should be taken by Government in order to tackle the inequalities in society. What mechanism, if any, is there to proof Government policies against the consequences which have been demonstrated by this most recent NESF report? In other words, what mechanism will the Taoiseach introduce to ensure Government policies are NESF-proofed and that this latest report will be factored into all future consideration?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the role of the NESF and the reason the Oireachtas is involved in it. It exists to proof the work that arises from the partnership process, as well as from other reports and from the Government&rsquo;s views on such matters. As the report points out, in recent years the number of people suffering from consistent poverty has more than halved from 8.3% to<?oasys _jy ?>4.1%. It also pointed out that the top 3% of taxpayers pay 28% of tax, showing our tax system is one of the most progressive systems extant. It also revealed a host of other areas in which it is a far fairer system for people on average employment than obtains in practically any other country, particularly for lower paid individuals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>However, it also pointed out that we have one of the worst records of any of the OECD countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It acknowledged the progressive nature of social policy in the past five or six budgets. It makes this point clearly and the statistics bear this out. For example, it notes that for people earning the average industrial wage, the <Col N="21"/>effective tax rate has fallen from approximately 27% or 28% to 15%. Nowhere else in the organised world has been able to achieve this. Moreover, it points to other areas where policy developments should result in a fairer society. To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, these issues are studied carefully and are taken into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take three brief questions from Deputies Kenny, Rabbitte and Joe Higgins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We should be able to continue this debate tomorrow, by agreement. Although it is extremely important, it was ruled out due to time constraints. I will be brief.</P>
        <P>I have four supplementary questions. First, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view, how realistic is the prospect of a ten-year national partnership agreement? Second, the Department of Finance&rsquo;s economic review and outlook published in August 2005 outlined some sobering matters for the economy. It referred to a sharp fall-off in exports, industrial productivity faltering and a stream of job losses in traditional manufacturing. What assurances can the Taoiseach give the House that these issues will be priorities on the agenda of the talks? Third, the same report states clearly that the economy relies heavily on the construction industry and on consumer spending. What arrangements has the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment made to ensure that these two issues will be central to the partnership talks?</P>
        <P>Fourth, the NESC&rsquo;s strategy report for 2006 was published on 15 December. It clearly referred to the scale of immigration to Ireland and noted that immigration adds almost as much again to the rate of population growth as does natural increase and that, obviously, this temporarily improves the age dependency ratio. Arising from that report and given that such workers are welcome here, does the Taoiseach not agree that there is now a desperate need for an integrated immigration policy which will speed up the asylum process, root out exploitation and work to prevent the potential for conflict between national and non-national workers before it takes place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny has made a reasonable suggestion about continuing this discussion tomorrow. A total of 14 questions that relate to topical, important, substantial matters have been taken in five minutes. I would like to have time to ask questions about the NESF, the performance of Sustaining Progress and, in particular, the talks that are under way. I would like to pursue a number of detailed questions about displacement and the maintenance of working conditions. However, given the manner in which this matter has fallen, the opportunity has not been provided to do so.</P><Col N="22"/>
        <P>While I am on my feet, may I ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a problem in so doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be helpful if the Taoiseach would agree that we have overshot the available time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Such a proposal would require an order of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Whips can arrange for the House to return to this matter tomorrow.</P>

	<P>It might be better if that was done now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose that the remaining supplementary questions be carried forward to tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question now and Deputy Rabbitte can leave his questions until tomorrow.</P>

	<P>I thank the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the ten-year strategy, recent agreements have demonstrated that in a number of areas one will not achieve sufficient policy changes or implementation within a short period. One is better off staying consistently with the major issues. They do not change that much from agreement to agreement. Perhaps a few new ones are added, as is the case with employment protection this time. Most of the key issues are the same and there is better implementation of them because they are national issues which have been put forward by NESC following detailed analysis on a wide basis rather than being dropped every few years before being taken up again. It is better to address them on a long-term basis and I hope colleagues agree. Naturally, they will not agree on the pay element but they should at least agree on the policy end of the agreement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Construction and consumer spend are major issues. The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment are involved in the talks and these issues will be discussed as well.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issues relating to integration. We have invested huge resources in the issue of asylum seekers. Staff numbers have increased significantly and the backlog has been dealt with effectively. A quick process is in place to deal with applications. The only delay relates to the appeals process, as applicants keep submitting appeals. Other than that, the system works well. The issues of education, language training and the examination of the structure of employment contracts are being addressed to ensure we do not <Col N="23"/>have difficulties. A study is being conducted on displacement to see if it is a problem and, if so, where and what can be done about it. That work is under way.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Hogan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>the legislative changes he plans in view of the recent judgment in the DCC-Fyffes case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4190/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislative and regulatory regime that applied to the DCC-Fyffes case was Part V of the Companies Act 1990. Part V has been largely repealed with the introduction of a new more robust and more wide-ranging regime which came into effect on 6 July 2005. This new regime consists of the Market Abuse (Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations 2005 and Part 4 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005, which together transposed the EU market abuse directive. This directive provides for a common EU legal framework for preventing, detecting, investigating and sanctioning both insider dealing and market manipulation, that is, where someone seeks to distort the price of financial instruments or disseminates information in a manner that gives false or misleading signals about financial instruments. It also provides for a common approach on disclosure of price sensitive information to the market to limit scope for insider dealing.</P>
        <P>While the Irish Stock Exchange was the competent authority for purposes of the old Part V regime, member states are no longer permitted to designate market operators-stock exchanges as competent authorities under the new market abuse regime. The directive specifically requires that the competent authority must be an administrative authority &ldquo;completely independent from all market participants&rdquo;. The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority &mdash; the Financial Regulator &mdash; has been designated as the competent authority for policing and enforcing compliance under the new legislation. The new regime applies to any financial instrument admitted to trading on a regulated market or where a request for admission to trading on such a market has been made. Essentially this covers the vast majority of listed companies in Ireland.</P>
        <P>It does not, however, apply to dealings-transactions in financial instruments of companies listed in the new Irish Stock Exchange junior market, known as IEX, which was launched last year. While markets such as IEX are outside the scope of the directive, it is planned to bring them <Col N="24"/>in from a national policy viewpoint. The Financial Regulator asked that we should defer doing this until the new legislation had been bedded down and it is planned to make the necessary changes later this year.</P>
        <P el="10">
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>In the meantime IEX companies continue to be subject to the Part V regime by virtue of provisions in the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005.</P>
        <P>While acknowledging in her judgment in the DCC-Fyffes case on 21 December 2005 that Part V of the 1990 Act has been largely repealed by the new legislation, Ms Justice Laffoy nevertheless expressed the view that it would be prudent if section 109(1)(<i>b</i>) of Part V, in so far as it is still of relevance, were reviewed by the Legislature with a view to eliminating the uncertainty she perceives it creates. Section 109(1)(<i>b</i>) deals with civil liability and the judge saw some scope for argument as to the precise person to whom the provision refers. The issue is being examined by the Department in consultation with the company law review group with a view to seeing what legislative and-or drafting changes are necessary to address the issue raised by the judge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree the role played by the Stock Exchange in its initial response to the allegations of insider dealing in Fyffes raises concerns about a cosy club operating between those involved in big business and the supposed regulator of the sector at the time? Has he raised his concerns about this issue with the Director of Corporate Enforcement? What measures does he intend to take to ensure customers, as investors or through their involvement in pension funds, are protected against sharp practices involving publicly quoted shares?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Fundamentally, a new regulatory regime is operational to cover all these areas and it will be overseen by a new competent authority, the Financial Regulator. I am aware of the commentary on the DCC-Fyffes case, including that of Ms Justice Laffoy in her judgment, and we are examining the issues raised. I have referred a number of them to the company law review group with a view to ascertaining what additional legislative amendments may be necessary to deal with them. However, the legislative and regulatory regime that pertains is quite different from that which applied in the context of the case mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will agree that customers and pension fund investors are potentially the big losers if anything goes wrong in the regulation of the Stock Exchange. Is there a role for the National Consumer Agency in examining this matter given that we must be certain that pension funds are invested legally and trans<Col N="25"/>parently and that they are accountable? Reservations expressed by Ms Justice Laffoy in her judgment raise doubts about that. We want to clear up this matter once and for all. Will the Minister agree not only to refer the matter to the company law review group, with which I agree, but also to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the National Consumer Agency, the chairperson of which might have expertise in this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not agree with the Deputy. I have referred the case to the company law review group to seek advice on specific points raised in the judgment. Over recent years, EU legislation has been adopted in all the areas mentioned, a number of which were originally covered by my Department. One of the features of the radically new and robust legislation is that member states are no longer permitted to designate market operators or stock exchanges as competent authorities and, therefore, the competent authority must be an administrative authority independent of all market participants.</P>
        <P>The following is the current position on new EU legislation. The prospectus directive was transposed into Irish law on 1 July 2005; the new market abuse directive was transposed on 6 July 2005, with a number of provisions coming into effect on 1 October 2005; and a new ongoing disclosure obligation under the transparency directive is due for transposition by January 2007. IFSRA has been designated as the competent authority for the purposes of the new prospectus and market abuse directives and it will also be designated as the competent authority in respect of the transparency directive.</P>
        <P>Overall political responsibility for the Stock Exchange rests with the Minister for Finance under the Stock Exchange Act 1995 which provides for the regulation of stock exchanges and their members. The Act provides the Financial Regulator with substantial powers in the initial authorisation of Stock Exchange members and their ongoing supervision.</P>

        <Quest>the actions he is taking to protect migrant workers who are employed as domestic workers; and his plans to introduce employment regulation orders outlining rates of pay and minimum standards for domestic workers in light of increasing evidence <Col N="26"/>that these workers are being exploited and mistreated.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to other workers. In the area of pay and conditions, it is primarily the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 that apply to employees employed in domestic service. I have no function in the introduction of employment regulation orders, EROs. Such powers are vested in joint labour committees and the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>Section 36 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 provides that an application for the establishment of a joint labour committee can be made to the Labour Court by the Minister, or a trade union or any organisation or group of persons claiming to be representative of relevant workers or of relevant employers. The possibility of establishing a joint labour committee, under the auspices of the Labour Court, has been mooted and is under examination in my Department to determine the feasibility of that approach, including enforcement difficulties arising from provisions in our Constitution and in the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission commissioned the University of Limerick to carry out a review of the JLC system in 2005. Arising from this review and following bilateral consultations with the social partners and stakeholders, the Department has prepared a paper that will be used as the basis for implementation of the review in further consultation with the social partners and stakeholders, in the context of the forthcoming partnership talks. The issue of a JLC for domestic workers, and proposals for new JLCs for other sectors, will be considered in this context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated to me in December last that his Department had held bilateral discussions with relevant stakeholders regarding the implementation of the recommendations in the University of Limerick review. In December, the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs promised that the establishment of a JLC for domestic workers was being considered. Since then, there have been two reports, one from the Migrant Rights Centre, which documented cases of low pay, excessive working hours, unreasonable working conditions, illegal deductions and threatening deportation, among women engaged in domestic work here. <Col N="27"/>An investigation by the <i>Irish Independent</i> found that some young women are being paid as little as &euro;25 for a 14-hour day. It found that women who come here to work as nannies, carers and domestic workers end up &ldquo;being treated as domestic slaves, working 14-hour days, for six days a week, sometimes for as little &euro;1.75 an hour&rdquo;. In the context of that evidence, since the Minister gave me an assurance that the establishment of a system of protecting rights for this category of workers was being considered, will he now accept that it is time he implemented that recommendation, if such a recommendation exists? What is his view on the establishment of a JLC for domestic workers? In the interim, what steps will he take to protect from gross exploitation such vulnerable people who have come to our country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Any abuse of domestic workers is unacceptable and deserves to be condemned on all sides of the House. My Department no longer generally issues work permits for domestic workers, including carers or minders and nannies, except in exceptional and limited circumstances where the Department may have an assurance that workers have supports in place. As I outlined in my initial reply, the bottom line is that there are significant legal issues in terms of the enforcement powers that labour inspectors would normally have when engaged in compliance checking on entry to the employer&rsquo;s premises and on sight of documentation and so on. However, where the place of work is a domestic dwelling, the position is different. For example, the provisions of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Articles 40 and 43 of the Constitution come into play and place considerable restrictions on the power of an inspector to enter the said premises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the difficulties. What will the Minister do about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">These are relevant in the context of inspectors entering private dwellings in pursuance of employment rights compliance checking and enforcement. Article 40.5 of the Constitution provides that the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law. Article 43 of the Constitution provides as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.</P>

	<P>I know all that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy knows it, he will understand why there is a time lag between September and now.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="28"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will do nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy made a big song and dance about being told something by the Minister of State in September. I am pointing out the very real difficulties that occur. We would like to provide a constitutional amendment. We are in discussions with the social partners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>They tend to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are other issues in that some of the social partners put forward the idea that recruiting agencies or employment agencies should be designated as representing employers. I would have difficulty with this proposal because it is not logical. I do not think they could represent individuals who would employ people in this context. We have consulted the Labour Court and discussed the matter with the Labour Relations Commission. While the feasibility of this proposal is difficult, we have a positive predisposition to it. We will be anxious to resolve some of the issues during the social partnership discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister plans to ensure that domestic workers are made aware of their rights? It is fine to stand here and quote the Constitution. Many Irish workers do not know what is in the Constitution, much less domestic workers coming here from abroad on work permits. Has the Minister plans to make these workers aware of the rates of pay and minimum standards that should apply, for example? Is the Minister considering encouraging these people to join trade unions who would, in turn, make them aware of their rights?</P>
        <P>I am pleased these priority questions have been tabled this afternoon because domestic workers are probably the most vulnerable of all workers in the State because they are employed behind closed doors. We know that large groups of workers are not being inspected, so what chance have these people? How many inspections have been carried out in terms of domestic workers? Given that the Minister knows where these workers are, because they are subject to work permits, can he give the House this information this evening? The report of the Migrant Rights Centre outlined how these people are completely isolated. It outlined terrible personal cases of how workers were brutalised in these homes. Is the Minister taking steps to ensure that further inspections will take place? Many victims believe that because the work permit is held by the employer, it is another stick to use against them. They feel they are caught in a trap from which they cannot get free. Has the Minister seen the report of the Migrant Rights Centre and will he react on foot of it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We will meet the migrant action group at some stage to discuss the matters they <Col N="29"/>raised in the context of the Work Permits Bill which is currently going through the House. Part of the legislation relates to the positioning of key information on work permits in terms of wages, conditions of employment and so on which seeks to give added protection to workers, including issuing work permits to workers. This will strengthen the information available to migrant workers. In addition, F&Aacute;S has engaged in a substantial information campaign on labour law and the Irish labour situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Through what means?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Through multilingual leaflets and a lo-call phone service whereby people from different countries can ring up and get a response in their own language on their rights and entitlements, what is available in terms of employment opportunities and so on. The Know Before You Go campaign aims to talk to people before they arrive in Ireland about their entitlements and so on. I recently launched that campaign with F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, we do not issue work permits generally for domestic workers because of the difficulties involved in enforcement and the potential for abuse to emerge. This has been a very restrictive feature on issuing work permits to domestic workers. We are aware of very difficult cases where people with significant illnesses who live at home require domestic support and help. In some cases we have responded positively in those situations where we have been given certain guarantees and assurances about supports that would be available. Given the demographics and the way the country is going, if we can get the enforcement and compliance issues right, there is potential for a proper, regulated market in the area of domestic employment. I hope we can iron out some of the representational and legal issues in the context of social partnership because there are wider issues around the joint labour committees and also around the issue of labour law enforcement, on which we have engaged comprehensively and substantively with the social partners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The latter statement from the Minister is the most important one, that is, that the response should not be to exclude people because there is a definite need and a requirement for people to come, but to regulate properly. That really is the nub of my question; how are we going to regulate properly? Will the Minister indicate how it will happen in the short term? Negotiating with the social partners is one thing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s indication that he will meet with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland in regard to the work permits Bill, but will he specifically meet the Domestic Workers Support Group, which is a subsidiary of the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, to hear the specific difficulties it has?

        <P>What is the extent of the Know Before You Go campaign? In what countries does it operate to give clear information? I spoke to a Polish national at the weekend who said Poles ring her all the time and they are unaware of their rights or entitlements. Poles are the most populous group of immigrant workers here so countries that would not be represented in such great numbers would be less likely to have access to that information.

        <asker>Mr. Eamon Ryan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if his Department has evidence of the lowering of average wage levels within certain sectors of the economy here due to an increase in labour supply from new European accession states; and the measures that are available to the Government to counter such a trend should it develop.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4405/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very difficult to provide evidence regarding the impact on wage levels of the increase in new European accession states&rsquo; nationals working here. This is because it is not possible to conclusively isolate this impact from that of the various other factors that affect wage levels.</P><Col N="31"/>
        <P>It is true that a significant number of EU-10 nationals have joined our labour force since accession in May 2004. We know that since May 2004 over 160,000 PPS numbers have been issued to them. Based on Revenue Commissioners data, it is estimated that about 70% of these people have employment details and therefore worked here at some stage, although many of them may have returned home in the meantime.</P>
        <P>Preliminary indications regarding whether the participation of these EU-10 nationals has had a significant impact on overall wage levels, or on unemployment rates here, are that in overall terms it has not. Unemployment in Ireland remains at very low levels and has averaged 4.3% over the past year, the lowest in the European Union. In the year to the third quarter of 2005, employment grew by 5.1%, in other words, an additional 96,000 jobs were created, of which about 40,000 were taken up by non-nationals. In general, non-national workers appear to be filling jobs in those sectors which are experiencing strong jobs growth.</P>
        <P>Most sectors of the economy in which a high proportion of EU-10 nationals are working are also showing fairly robust levels of earnings growth. For example, many EU nationals are working in the construction sector and the latest figures for that sector show fairly strong annual wage growth to the third quarter of 2005 of 6.8%.</P>
        <P>I am fully committed to ensuring the employment rights of these workers are effectively enforced on the same basis as their Irish colleagues. As Deputies are aware, this issue is being discussed with the social partners at talks that began last Thursday. I assure Deputy Eamon Ryan that all efforts are being made to ensure that the State&rsquo;s employment legislation covers all employees and exploitation will not be tolerated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the point that the measures we have protect all workers but concerns exists that while we have certain protections in terms of, for example, the minimum wage, the real concern among trade unions and elsewhere is that this may become a standard wage and that we need more scientific evidence as to what exactly is going on. The figures the Minister gave for the construction industry are interesting and would dispel such concerns, given the percentage increase outlined by him. Does the Minister not agree that the real concern in this issue is a decrease in wage levels, rather than the issue of displacement, given our low unemployment rate and the research done by the Green Party?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The broad analysis of the CSO figures shows the percentage increase in job numbers. Given this has not been matched by a corresponding increase in tax revenue, is this a possible indication that while evidence shows wage levels in the construction industry are not decreasing, it may be occurring in other sectors? How does the <Col N="32"/>Minister propose to be more scientific in analysing this area?</P>
        <P>The Minister did not really address in his response what measures we could introduce or avail of if such a trend was to occur. In terms of a putative services directive, it appears the real concern is that we do not have legislative teeth in Ireland to protect wage levels, which does exist in other continental countries and that would be recognised within the framework of a services directive. We do not have the ability to avoid the minimum wage becoming, in a sense, the standard wage here. How can we get more scientific information and what can we do to hold up wage levels? Does the Minister believe we should be doing that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have fairly robust legislation, above and beyond the minimum wage, in terms of sectoral wage agreements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very limited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>They exist and those areas are being explored in the context of the current talks. I am not saying what is our position on that but we are exploring the whole registered employment agreements, REAs, scenario. They are well developed in the construction sector and have been for quite some time. We have engaged in sectoral agreements. I have also asked F&Aacute;S to study the impact of economic migration on the issues of both displacement and earnings. Some preliminary work has been done but the study is still in progress. As soon as we have some data from F&Aacute;S, we will send it to the Deputy. I note that Mr. Beggs of AIB is publishing its analysis of the matter at some stage today and I hope to study those figures.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that in some areas of manufacturing, agriculture and construction there may be some indicators of wages not climbing as high as others but that could be due to a number of factors. In manufacturing, for example, it could be due to some indigenous companies not participating in some aspects of it or to people deciding not to go overseas with their companies. I noticed in the past year that we have received more applications for work permits in agriculture than was the case in previous years. The argument being made is that it is increasingly difficult to get young people to seek careers in agriculture, particularly in manual work on farms. There can be a variety of factors leading to change in some sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>As other political representatives have mooted, one could look at whether one wants to stem the tide of migration into the country. I did not anticipate that was what Deputy Eamon Ryan was envisaging and that is why I did not go down that road. In fairness to him, he never has taken that position. That is an obvious instrument if one wanted to restrict the numbers coming in but that could create other pressures within the economy <Col N="33"/>if there was not sufficient supply. Currently our migration policy very much tracks the labour market trends.</P>
        <P>In the context of social partnership there is some exploration of the idea of some sectoral agreements, although flexibility is important on the other side of the equation, in terms of the overall cost base of the economy etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is correct in that my party is not of the view that restricting European Union accession state citizens to the labour market is the way to proceed.</P>
        <P>Regarding sectoral agreements some of which he mentioned existed here in a certain capacity, would the Minister agree with my understanding, which is derived from discussions with people who are examining it, particularly the development of the services directive, that under European rules and regulations such agreements here have no teeth and no binding force, and that the concern is that if we go down the route of this continued development in terms of globalisation or of opening our markets, as we do not have such support structures we may well see a widespread lowering of wage rates? Has his Department examined how those sectoral agreements could have real force? When he gets that information from F&Aacute;S, would he send it to the representatives of the other parties here so we can have a broad, open and honest debate on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly will do that. Overall, the evidence is not that there is a wholesale dramatic decline in wage levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>He should look at the income tax take from last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but wage levels generally have increased across the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The income tax take, with 90,000 extra people working&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I just made the point in the context of the construction industry, that they went up approximately 6.8%. Likewise the AIB analysis, published today, states the case remains to be proven or is not proven in terms of the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It depends on which newspaper one reads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not mean of course that we do not have to be vigilant about this. We must be vigilant because the Government&rsquo;s position is not to undermine living standards or drive down the earnings of people because we worked too hard to build the economy and to build the living standards and quality of life for all concerned.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 300 amendments tabled for the services directive, which is in draft <Col N="34"/>form. It has a long journey to go. I am particularly keen that we ensure our basic laws, in terms of pay, rates and conditions, are protected from anything the services directive has to bring forward.</P>
        <P>I listened to the debate in the House on the services directive and despite all the polemic commentary, everyone in the House stated by the way that they believed there should be some liberalisation and believed in the idea of access to markets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Much Irish employment is dependent on access to European markets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the argument. They are not mutually exclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Only last week I was with a company announcing an extra 50 jobs. It employs 250 already. It is in the services side of the economy and is looking for markets overseas. It is looking to break down barriers and regulations to get into other markets. We cannot have it both ways but our agenda is to achieve liberalisation of the market whilst protecting our basic standards.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>the action he intends to take to control price rises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4191/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>My policy and that of the Government is to provide that both consumer and competition law operate in such a way that the economic well-being of the consumer is maximised. The objective of consumer policy is to provide consumers with the knowledge required to make informed choices, to provide protection from unscrupulous traders and to guarantee that consumer interests are reflected in the decision making and enforcement process. Competition policy assists the consumer by providing a choice of goods and services at a range of prices.</P>
        <P>I therefore have no plans to reintroduce price control. I recall that during the 1980s when maximum prices orders under the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 were last in force, products covered by the orders quickly resulted in the maximum price being the minimum price. To reintroduce maximum price requirements would not only contradict the objectives of consumer and competition policy but would act against the economic interests of consumers by ensuring prices for products could not respond to competitive movements in the market. Such a policy would penalise many while it is unclear whether it would benefit those for whom it was aimed.</P>
        <P>Along with our phenomenal economic growth in recent years there has been an accompanying rise in the cost of living. Notwithstanding this, I <Col N="35"/>am pleased to note that the consumer price index fell to 2.5% in December 2005, the latest month for which figures are available. The inflation trend for 2005 was one of relative stability. When energy products are excluded from the overall consumer price index, annual inflation averaged 1.7% for the year. This highlights the impact of mainly imported energy products on our inflation. However, this should not stop us from using the policy tools we have at hand to affect prices. As regards grocery prices, one of the main provisions of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005, currently before the Oireachtas, is to revoke the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987. I expect that once the groceries order is repealed we will see greater competition in the retail grocery sector and prices will reflect this increased competition in the sector.</P>
        <P>The Consumer Strategy Group Report of May 2005 recommended the revocation of the groceries order. The principal recommendation of the group was the establishment of a new National Consumer Agency. This has been accepted by Government and I have established the agency on an interim basis. I hope to publish legislation to establish the new agency on a statutory basis later this year. The interim board of the agency has been involved in raising consumer awareness regarding their rights. The agency will have specific statutory powers and responsibilities in areas such as consumer advocacy, information, education and awareness, enforcement and research. I am certain that equipped with these powers the NCA will be able to make a positive impact and shift the balance more towards consumers as recommended by the Consumer Strategy Group. The Government will continue to use all the policy options available to ensure the interests of the consumer are protected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has indicated it is always the Government&rsquo;s policy to keep prices down. I do not know where he has been living for the past number of years but he and the Government have been responsible for 41 additional taxes and stealth charges since the last general election. Such inflation, introduced and imposed by Government arising from its decisions, has been running at six times the rate of inflation for the 12 months to the end of October 2005. That is a significant contribution the Minister and the Government are making to increasing prices to the consumer across the board.</P>
        <P>In that context, notwithstanding some of the comments the Minister has made about being pro-active in terms of the Competition Authority, I am not surprised he wants to exclude energy from the calculation of inflation. Honing in on the energy area of electricity charges and gas charges, there has been a 25% increase in gas charges in 2005 and a 61% increase in energy prices in the past four years. Would the Minister indicate his <Col N="36"/>view on the policy of his Department on the role of regulators, particularly in energy, and the massive contribution such regulators are making towards the deterioration of competitiveness?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some difficulty with the Deputy&rsquo;s presentation on prices generally. The National Competitiveness Council produced a clear analysis of where we are strong and weak in terms of competitiveness. It made clear that there was a lack of intense competition in the domestic markets, that the most productive side of the economy was the foreign direct investment side, and yet when we move to do something, for example, the abolition of the groceries order, Deputy Hogan in a calculated manner does everything possible to undermine that initiative and opposes it in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>When Government establishes a regulatory regime and regulators the last thing it should do is interfere, intervene or try to undermine them. The idea behind developing a liberal and competitive market is that it should be regu<Col N="38"/>lated independently of Government. It is facile and over-simplistic of the Deputy to label all sectors as filtering back to Government through local authorities and regulators etc. The Deputy&rsquo;s party gained extra seats in the last local elections and, along with other Opposition parties, has control of local authorities.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The imposition of penalties for non-compliance as well as redressing compensation to employees exists in over 14 legislative instruments from the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 1990 to the European Communities Protection of Employees and Transfer of Undertakings Regulations 2003. These penalties range from &euro;1,269 to &euro;12,500 for offences that range from failure to pay wages properly, failure to keep proper records, failure to co-operate with or giving false information to a labour inspector, failure to attend, comply with or give evidence to the relevant court, failure to comply with the conditions of employment fixed by an employment regulation order, and to effecting redundancies before the expiry of the 30 day notice given to the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from penalties imposed under the legislation, redress or compensation is awarded to employees by the Rights Commissioners, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court. This ranges from one week&rsquo;s pay for unlawful deduction from wages to up to two years&rsquo; salary for unfair dismissals, deterioration of conditions of employment after transfer of undertakings, or discrimination against fixed-term or part-time workers. The value of this redress or compensation increases as wages increase.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The levels of fines or redress are matters for the Rights Commissioners, Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court to decide on a case by case basis. In many instances the maximum level set down in the various Acts and regulations is not imposed. The labour inspectorate and the Department maintain that escalating penalties, interest charges, punitive damage and other such sanctions would enhance the compliance regime and underpin the general policy approach of our labour inspectorate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned the Government is increasingly using the partnership talks process as an excuse to hold back on urgently needed legislation. We heard it in the response to the previous question, when Deputy Howlin and I were told that partnership talks were being used to negotiate protection for domestic workers. In this case the talks are being used to negotiate harsher penalties for rogue employers. SIPTU describes the penalties for non-compliance with employment rights legislation as &ldquo;so paltry as to have absolutely no deterrent effect&rdquo; and I agree.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that some employers calculate the savings to be gained by exploiting workers far outweigh the penalties imposed in the unlikely event of being caught doing so? Does he agree there is increased evidence of exploitation, <Col N="40"/>particularly in the past year, that suggests we need to increase deterrents for these rogue employers, including penalties against them?</P>
        <P>How many employers were subject to penalties for non-compliance with employment rights legislation in 2005? What was the largest such penalty imposed on an employer in 2005, a year of unprecedented revelations of worker exploitation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally we agree with the Opposition in that we would like to see an increase in the penalties to act as a greater deterrent. While we are not waiting for social partnership discussions to conclude it will be discussed in that context. We are in favour of strong deterrents to prevent unscrupulous employers from breaking the law.</P>
        <P>Our preferred policy, on which we have worked with the social partners, is to move towards a system that seeks and secures redress from employers, by agreement, where it is acknowledged that wrong has been done or the law has not been upheld. Going to court can sometimes be lengthy and is not always as effective as we might like to think. We have a variety of sanctions for employers found guilty of exploiting workers and so on, not least the withholding of work permits in the future.</P>
        <P>We are taking a twin-track approach, namely, increasing the deterrents and establishing whether there are better ways to enforce labour law. The most recent and interesting case is Gama Construction in which our officials recouped and retrieved substantial funds and moneys for the workers concerned. The officials also sought assurances from Gama Construction about its future performance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately we saw in that case how Gama was rewarded for its waywardness by receiving the contract for the Castleblaney bypass. When will we see the results of this search for new ways of enforcing labour law? Ministers say they are looking at this, studying that or have commissioned a report from the other. When will something be done to change the actions of these rogue employers? There is a growing number of them and workers need to be protected.</P>

	<P>Job creation and retention in Enterprise Ireland-supported companies are day-to-day matters for the agency itself, and not ones in which I am directly involved.</P>
        <P>Provisional figures indicate that in 2005 the number of jobs gained in Enterprise Ireland companies amounted to 12,212. That was offset by job losses of 12,430, giving a net decline of 218. I emphasise that those 2005 figures are provisional and will be finalised only when the 2006 Forf&aacute;s employment survey is undertaken later this year. This time last year, the provisional figures for 2004 indicated a net job loss of 1,317 in Enterprise Ireland companies. However, outturn figures for 2004 now show that Enterprise Ireland companies created 15,933 jobs and lost 13,956 jobs, resulting in a net gain for 2004 of 1,977 jobs.</P>

	<P>They were created towards the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Despite the pressures experienced in some sectors, total unemployment in Ireland remains relatively low, at 4.3%, and economic growth is estimated at 4.8% for 2005. With more than 2 million people in work, Ireland enjoys one of the lowest unemployment-to-employment ratios in the EU 15.</P>
        <P>In recent years, Irish manufacturing firms, particularly in more traditional sectors, have operated against a backdrop of significantly declining external demand, downward price pressure, and an increasingly competitive international environment, together with upward pressure on costs and the strengthening of the euro against our key trading partners&rsquo; currencies. In contrast, the 12,212 new jobs created in Enterprise Ireland client companies during 2005 are heavily concentrated in high value-added, knowledge-based companies that offer greater security in the face of intense international competition. The headline figures do not reflect the considerable churn taking place in the Irish economy or the quality of jobs being achieved.</P>
        <P>Irish manufacturing companies must increasingly compete though innovation, adopting best practice, maintaining a relentless focus on driving productivity gains and increased automation to maintain competitiveness. In addition, companies need to be outward-looking in their development strategies.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2005 to 2007, which I launched last year, sets out the role the agency will play in transforming Irish companies into market-focused and innovation-driven companies with the ability to complete successfully in world markets. A significant initiative under the strategy is the productivity improvement fund, which supports manufacturing companies to adopt advanced technologies and focus on skill developments to improve productivity, thus laying the foundation for export readiness. Research and innovation are also critical to success in the increasingly global marketplace for all companies, regardless of sector.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland encourages sustained levels of research and development activity through its RTI scheme and research and development initiatives. In addition, support for entrepreneurs to establish high-potential start-up companies, HPSUs, is vital to ensure a constant stream of companies providing valuable employment opportunities as such companies grow in scale. In 2005 alone, 75 HPSUs were established with Enterprise Ireland support in sectors as diverse as biotechnology, photonics, medical devices, functional foods, ICT and entertainment.</P><Col N="43"/>

	<P>It is a worrying development that Irish-owned indigenous businesses are coming under pressure. We saw the decline in manufacturing in 2005. The enterprise strategy report, Ahead of the Curve, was excellent, and the Minister has said that some aspects are being implemented. What action does he intend to take &mdash; I see none in the Finance Bill &mdash; to improve the take-up of research and development? The Government seems to be making no effort to promote research and development through greater incentives. The 20% incentive that the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, introduced some time ago apparently is not being taken up. Perhaps it is not attractive enough or offset against payroll costs. Does the Minister have any initiative to ensure greater involvement by Enterprise Ireland in assisting companies in research and development to create added value and additional employment in 2006?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Enterprise Ireland and I have the substantive commitment to research and development. I am working with it to enhance and grow the number of companies engaged in meaningful research and development. Part of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new strategic vision involves a defined objective in terms of the number of companies. In essence, it wants to double to more than 1,000 the number involved in significant research and development, which means spending more than &euro;100,000. I am also working with Government colleagues to develop a medium-term strategic position on further ramping up research and development and investment in the country.</P>
        <P>This Government, more than any in the history of the State, has created a new platform of research and development expenditure through the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, and the SFI. We now wish to move beyond that to prepare ourselves and ensure that we are competitive enough to withstand the pressures of globalisation and so on. There is a great deal of action on the Enterprise Ireland front on research and development, and the kinds of technology-based companies now emerging as having high potential growth are quite significant and cutting it with the rest globally.</P>

	<P>The people have grown tired of the Government&rsquo;s continuing inability to deliver public services. They are equally tired of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s inability to manage their money competently. After nine years of the present Government in office, we are still waiting for a decent health service. Levels of crime are practically out of control, and literacy among children is as bad now as six years ago. The Government has a shameful record of misspending public money. Some &euro;50 million has so far gone on redundant electronic voting machines, and &euro;135 million on a failed computer system in the health service. Millions more have been wasted on such issues as the national stadium and what has been called &ldquo;the great bowl project&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s report on an analysis of tax incentives over which the Government has presided for nine years must bring about a new level of despair among hard-working, tax paying families. In this case, the facts are indisputable. Those schemes have cost &euro;1.6 billion in the past five years, and we have not yet seen the final bill. The cost of the reliefs is double that of the benefits arising. Most schemes have benefited a relatively small number of high-earning individuals, some developers and several landowners. So much for fairness in the tax system.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach presides over the Government and has had the honour of doing so for the past nine years. Does he accept that the failure of his Government properly to evaluate incentives and undertake full cost-benefit analysis before renewing schemes has literally cost the Irish taxpayer millions? As head of the Government, does he accept that the inability in question and the fact that no cost-benefit analysis was carried out have been a fundamental mistake? Will he now issue instructions to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, that any new relief be subject to a full cost-benefit analysis before introduction and a statutory sunset clause to prevent its renewal without such a review in the interests of those who have paid &euro;1.6 billion in taxes in the past five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government decided back in December 2004 to report on a total appraisal of all the reliefs that have been in place for the past 17 or 18 years. It was agreed to report on and publish the documents in full at the conclusion of the deliberative process and with the publication of the Finance Bill. The three sets of documents were published yesterday. They demonstrate for the first time the historical context of these reliefs <Col N="46"/>which have been in existence for the better part of 20 years.</P>
      <P>A total of 24 schemes were reviewed. Goodbody Economic Consultants reviewed four schemes: the area-based renewal scheme, the urban town renewal scheme, the rural renewal scheme and the living over the shop scheme. Indecon Economic Consultants reviewed 11 sectoral property-based schemes, namely, reliefs for hotels, holiday cottages, student accommodation, third level buildings, car parks, hospitals, nursing homes, sports clinics, park and ride facilities, child care buildings and rental refurbishment. The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners revised and reviewed nine schemes: reliefs for forestry, significant buildings, patent income, pensions provisions, artists&rsquo; income, certain investment loans, greyhound stud fees, donations to charities and other approved bodies and the tonnage tax. The results have been published.</P>
      <P>I am sure, like everyone else, Deputy Kenny welcomes the fact that the Government had the foresight to undertake the first in-depth analysis of these schemes to review which ones should be retained, which should be phased out in the short term and which require amendment. The Minister has moved to amend some of the schemes, phase out others, curb others and cap others. He has introduced a range of other initiatives. Some of the schemes being examined are gone, such as the Temple Bar scheme, the Custom House docks scheme, the seaside resorts scheme and some other schemes.</P>
      <P>I do not regard all the schemes as a waste of money. Many of the schemes were initiated in different times when this country was on its knees. Many of them were an attempt to prime-pump a lifeless economy. Some of them were good value for money and some created many jobs. However, some of the schemes have outlived their usefulness. I expect Members will express their views on the schemes during the debate on the Finance Bill. Some schemes were too generous and were picked up and used by smart people and people who could go close to the line of tax evasion. That can happen with such schemes and the Government has made its decision on them.</P>
      <P>In the cold light of day, people will realise that many of these schemes were introduced when it was not possible to generate activity in this and other cities and, even with the generous schemes on offer, it was difficult to find people to develop and invest. Last year a total of 95,000 jobs were created in the economy and it will be argued that schemes are not necessary. However, this review is a historical examination to form a basis for future action. The Minister has already taken action on a number of the schemes. The Minister has stated that an economic analysis of the schemes will be undertaken.</P><Col N="47"/>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Kenny, I remember many of the arguments made by politicians about past schemes. The argument was that they amounted to tax foregone. It was a good argument then and it may be a good argument now, but if nobody was interested in investing in, for example, a site lying unused in an area of social exclusion, it was not a case of tax foregone. That is the assumption made when something has been developed but I never agreed with that point of view, which is the purist, economic view of mandarins who did not understand the real world. I disagreed with that view a decade ago and I disagree with it now. If it had prevailed, there would have been no schemes and this country would still be a basket case.</P>

	<P>The place would be barren.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The charge I have made against the Taoiseach is that the failure of the Government to properly evaluate incentives and to have a full cost benefit analysis carried out before any extension has in the past five years cost the taxpayer &euro;1.5 billion. The two mistakes made were non-evaluation of the schemes and no cost benefit analysis was carried out prior to an extension taking place. Four years ago the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, announced the ending of these schemes. He knew then, as did the Government, that their time was up. Yet, in 2002, for example, the relief for multi-storey car parks, which was to end in 2000, was extended three times, to 2002, 2004 and 2006, with no examination carried out of worthwhile progress made. In December 2003, with one wave of the Government pen, the life of a range of schemes was extended from 2004 to 2006, with no examination carried out. These schemes included the urban renewal scheme, the multi-storey car park, hotels, student accommodation, rural renewal and park and ride facilities schemes.</P>
      <P>The Government failed by not carrying out any proper evaluation of the incentives and analysis before the schemes were extended. The Taoiseach could have saved a fortune for the taxpayer if this had been done and I ask him to include it now. I presume those who were creaming off the benefits of these schemes went to Government and made their case to have the schemes renewed without analysis. Does this not demonstrate beyond yea or nay, beyond denial, that the Government of which the Taoiseach has been head for nine years, has a much greater care for and pays much greater attention to a small number of elite super rich who have benefited greatly from these schemes, extended without examination to the detriment of the hard-working taxpayers who cannot find a garda on the street, cannot get into an accident and emergency department and cannot get teachers for their schools, whose children are being bullied in other <Col N="48"/>schools and who find that life in this country has become nothing but pressure? There is no escape for them from paying their taxes, yet the Government has cost them &euro;1.5 billion in the past five years by allowing a range of these schemes to have continued without a cost benefit analysis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has been calling for the past five years for these measures to be implemented. The then Minister, Mr. McCreevy, was aware of the situation four years ago but nothing was done by the Government. Will the Taoiseach admit to those two fundamental failures which, if dealt with, could have saved the taxpayer millions of euro but which have cost him &euro;1.5 billion in the past five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain to the House the reason I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s view. Given that the number of people working here is double that when many of these schemes started, we are not paying the same high levels of taxation or interest on the national debt. Savings of hundreds of millions of euro have been made in the economy. We have primed an economy to a state where there is investment, activity and employment, and taxes are generated.</P>
      <P>The advice was given to successive parties and Governments that on every scheme up for extension a year should be taken to do an economic analysis, but most of these schemes would never have happened if such advice had been heeded. I acknowledge there are areas where bright sparks have managed to find ways to use the schemes and that every year &mdash; and I suppose this will happen every year forever more &mdash; it is necessary to close down loopholes on budget night. This is one of the best economies in Europe, based primarily on the building-up of intelligence, incentives and activities for investment. I remind the House that 3% of the highest earners in this country pay 28% of the total tax take. It is always necessary to keep an eye on investment schemes but we do not wish to create a culture where our people invest all over the world.</P>

	<P>Members of the Opposition complain that the 9% stamp duty is driving investment out of the country. These initiatives were designed to keep people investing here. When the then Minister, Mr. McCreevy, announced he was curtailing film relief, which is not a sector that creates the highest number of jobs, this House was delirious with condemnation that this could be done. We cannot have it both ways. One may undertake economic analyses but this country employs 2 million people, the economy has been growing by 7% or 8%, we have no debt crisis and our taxes are low because we have helped to make this economy strong.</P>

	<P>I do not recall anybody in the House saying that, at the right time and for the right duration, tax-based incentive schemes cannot make a contribution to economic activity. That is not the issue and the Taoiseach knows that better than most in the House. The issue is that they were allowed to go on and on and were renewed and extended. There was no cost-benefit analysis of their merit at any given time. However, as Deputy Kenny said, it was suspected that the Department of Finance would have known that some of them had long outlived their usefulness when Ministers were forced to come into the House and announce that they would take action on them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;but never did. I take issue with a great deal of what the Taoiseach has said. I wish to focus on an issue which the Taoiseach is getting away with in his remarks. Listening to public commentary on it, on radio and elsewhere, the Government has also got away with it &mdash; that is, conveying the impression that this is now a historical issue, that it is over and has been dealt with. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let us be clear that all that has been announced is that most of the property-based schemes will be terminated from July 2008 on the other side of the general election. We have heard it all before. Even the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, infatuated as he was by some of the high rollers who benefitted from this, announced termination but it never happened. We have now got to the other side of the general election and the impression is being given that some action is being taken.</P>
      <P>The Government has conveyed the notion that there will now be &mdash; what my colleague, Deputy <Col N="50"/>Burton, argued for over a number of budget speeches &mdash; a minimum effective tax rate. That is not clear either, because it is only in the case of a certain number of reliefs that will be scheduled that the extent of relief will be capped.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There are others that are not included and entirely new ones have been opened. These include, for example, the new provision for private mental hospitals. The McCreevy one for the constituent in Naas is now being extended to allow money to go into building private mental hospitals. That seems absolutely remarkable to me. I know of no report or cost-benefit analysis on this. I have strong views on the question of the development of a parallel private health service based on the public hospital campuses. What is the basis of this latest provision? It is a new loophole, which is wide open in the Act. The money that is shut off in certain schemes will now flood into the new schemes. It is not just bright sparks; there are bright sparks working for the Taoiseach who know this. They have found it out over the years but they do not act on it.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says the Government has made decisions on this, but the Government has only made such decisions as have been made as a result of the issue being raised on these benches over the years. For example, for the past five or six years, Deputy Burton has been pushing for the abolition of a tax exemption for stallion fees, which does not feature here. There is a paragraph saying &ldquo;We will pass it over&rdquo; but it has not been dealt with at all. The decisions taken by the Government are minimal and by comparing it to stamp duty, the Taoiseach pays serious disrespect to people&rsquo;s intelligence in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government examined the position that pertained over the past 20 years. The last review of shelters and tax allowances was undertaken in 1992, which did not cover all the schemes. We have gone back to Goodbody, Inde<Col N="51"/>con, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, and have examined all the schemes and have comprehensively reported on them. The results of those reviews were available for this year&rsquo;s budget in which the Minister for Finance announced the termination of ten property relief schemes. As Deputy Rabbitte said, transitional arrangements will apply until July 2008. That was done on the advice of the consultant not to overheat the construction sector in the current year. The reliefs for stallion and greyhound stud fees will also end on that date, as has already been announced.</P>
      <P>In the case of pension funds, since budget day on 7 December 2005, a cap of &euro;5 million has applied to the size of a pension fund, except where a higher value applied on that day. In all cases, no tax-free lump sum greater than &euro;1.25 million can be paid out of a pension fund on and from 7 December 2005. A cap on the use of various tax reliefs by high earners to reduce their annual tax liability was announced by the Minister. That legislation is now contained in section 17 of the Finance Bill before the House today. That cap applies to those with incomes of more than &euro;250,000 per annum. It will increase the effective rate of tax on those with high incomes who use the particular reliefs. Some of them over use those reliefs. This was the most detailed review ever undertaken on tax schemes. Specific property schemes have been terminated in other cases in recent years, including the Temple Bar, seaside resort and Customs House docks area schemes. Many other schemes were analysed also.</P>
      <P>It is untrue to state that the construction schemes were rolled over. The original scheme was the section 23 one that was effectively available anywhere in the State. That was curbed to apply only for urban renewal areas that were designated by local authorities as areas that developers would not develop. Parts of Cork, Limerick, Dublin and Galway that were most deprived ten or 15 years ago have now been fully developed to include residential communities. That is because we curbed section 23. The economic analysis showed that provision was not required in the good areas of various cities. When the section was curbed it forced money into developing deprived urban areas. That initiative has been highly successful, if sometimes costly, and I am aware of the argument concerning taxes foregone. Nonetheless, it has generated large-scale employment and investment while reducing taxes to create a vibrant economy.</P>
      <P>When I referred earlier to bright sparks I was referring in particular to pension schemes. The way in which some people used pension funds was certainly not what was foreseen. That is the point I was making.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not contesting that it is a detailed review and neither am I contesting that some of the schemes for some of the time made an important contribution that otherwise might not have happened. There is an impression being sold about the tax system under which we live, the sort of Vincent Browne-like, naive, 1960s analysis, that because we do not pay a 75% rate of personal tax, this is a very fair tax system. What is fair about a tax system whereby high-rollers get the kind of benefits exposed in these reports? The cost of &euro;1.6 billion is double the benefit. What is fair about that? The Progressive Democrats have a &ldquo;40-20&rdquo; mantra with regard to personal tax, although the actual figure is 42%. The 40-20 figure is easily sold to people, but this is where the real unfairness exists in the tax code, has been allowed to exist, and after yesterday&rsquo;s announcements will continue to exist. It is not true to suggest it is a historical issue with which we have now dealt. No action will be taken. The existing schemes will obviously continue to run. That is a contract.</P>
      <P>The property-based schemes will not finish until after the general election when we will have a new situation. The fear of overheating the construction sector is a fear of overheating it between now and the general election. The Government has taken no action over nine years to interfere <Col N="53"/>or intervene in that market, which has produced the circumstances which the Government and I know will inevitably come to grief down the road. As the Minister for Finance said this morning, he merely hopes for a soft landing. There was no intervention of any kind, so the Government is not going to terminate these schemes before the general election because it is fearful of the fallout.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Regarding the pension fund, a cap of &euro;5 million is supposedly fantastic news for the unfortunate worker on 20% tax who received a big break from the Minister for Finance. Instead of the 20% relief the worker could expect to get, he or she will now get &euro;2,500 on &euro;7,500 out of the SSIA. Compare that with the &euro;5 million cap that is left, not to mention the sort of person who could put &euro;25 million into a pension fund and avoid paying any tax as a result.</P>
      <P>This is the serious inequity and unfairness in the tax code, not the blather about 20-40 or 20-42, which is almost meaningless when one looks at the amount of tax which people with wealth pay, and the amount of tax which ordinary workers on the average industrial wage and somewhat more are liable to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not deal with all the points made but the following is the position. We have taken a historical and a current look at all the schemes in every area and made changes to some of them. Some are gone or are being phased out. Others will remain for continual appraisal by the Department of Finance to see their merits over time. Some will live on because they are beneficial. The cap on various tax reliefs on high earners to reduce their annual tax liabilities, an issue debated in this House over a long period, was announced by the Minister for Finance and will be passed into law by means of the Finance Bill, debate on which will begin today.</P>
      <P>The effective tax rate in this country for people on the average wage has fallen from about 28% to 15%, which represents a considerable reduction for the ordinary hard-pressed person. I will not discuss the SSIA scheme, but it is always amusing that people criticised the initiative and said it was ridiculous yet now say we should extend it.</P>
      <P>I am glad this debate has shown that many of these schemes are beneficial. Where they are not, are being abused, have run out of time or are not necessary, we will move on from them, as the Minister for Finance said. This has been a good year&rsquo;s work by the Minister for Finance in being the first person in 20 years to do a full examination of all the schemes, to outline his future intentions in the case of a large number of them and to enact relevant legislation, some of which he has done since the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>In the week leading up to the 25th anniversary of the Stardust disaster, I wish to ask the Taoiseach a few questions. More than 800 <Col N="54"/>young people attended that disco on the eve of St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day 1981. By the end of the night, 48 were dead and hundreds more injured. There are unresolved issues following the inquiry which sat for 122 days but left so many questions unanswered. It is now clear the inquiry did not go far enough and there are many questions which the Taoiseach might begin to answer if he were to focus on the issues. Despite numerous inspections of the Stardust building by Dublin Corporation, the owners were able to get away with repeated breaches of fire regulations and building by-laws. The question many ask is why so many patrons were prevented from escaping because of locked or chained fire exits.</P>
      <P>Fianna F&aacute;il was in power at the time and many of the Stardust victims feel they were badly let down. Many of the relatives are still grieving for many reasons. They did not receive any counselling, while medical cards were given and withdrawn even before the injured could return to work. The tribunal claimed the cause of the fire was probably arson, yet the Garda report disputes this. Victims lodged 245 writs but the only one to come to court was made by the Stardust manager. State compensation was paid on condition that no further claims would be lodged, and the biggest beneficiary was the Stardust management.</P>
      <P>Many of the relatives would like an answer to a basic question. After 25 years, will the Taoiseach meet them at least to hear what they have to say and perhaps address some of the issues which arise if we are to prevent another Stardust tragedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will not take up the same amount of time taken by the other party leaders. In 1985, 11 ambulances were available to Dublin fire brigade to answer 26,000 emergency calls. In 2005, 68,500 emergency calls were made, nearly a trebling of such calls since 1985, but the number of ambulances remains at 11. After the Stardust tragedy, seven fire prevention officer posts were created by Dublin Corporation for the whole of Dublin city and county. Today, that number remains at seven despite the expansion of Dublin city and its council with all the new hotels, tax breaks notwithstanding, and many more concert venues and pubs on the outskirts and suburbs of Dublin. Does a cold shiver run up the Taoiseach&rsquo;s spine with the thought that another Stardust could happen? The way the figures look, that is very possible. Will the Taoiseach meet the relatives of the victims? Will he double the Dublin fire brigade ambulance numbers and at least double the district office fire prevention posts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The anniversary of that tragic night is a week away and the thoughts of all are with the families of those killed or injured in the Stardust tragedy. As we approach the 25th anni<Col N="55"/>versary of a terrible night, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform understands the families&rsquo; concerns regarding the background, and his Department has been working with and assisting the families in a number of ways. The Government is prepared to continue that help. Officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently met representatives of the Stardust victims committee, one of a series of meetings held with that committee.</P>
      <P>The committee also forwarded a report prepared on its behalf to the Garda Commissioner and the Garda forensic science laboratory. I know the Commissioner and the laboratory responded that the report contained no new evidence. I can confirm to the House that the Garda concluded that no new evidence was forthcoming which would warrant it revisiting the investigation and it was considered that all the matters raised were adequately addressed at the time. I understand this information was given to the Stardust victims committee. Any further submissions the committee might wish to make will be carefully examined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned counselling and other issues. I understand they are being dealt with on an ongoing basis. Parliamentary questions have been asked but there is no need to go through them. Obviously, since the Stardust tragedy &mdash; as we have seen internationally &mdash; there have been two not unrelated issues. It is always a concern that these kinds of events and tragedies like them can happen in different ways. Most of the recommendations following the Stardust tragedy &mdash; I am reading from a note from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government &mdash; go through all of the areas, such as investment, infrastructure, equipment, better training and communications, legislation and other issues. The facts about what happened are there.</P>
      <P>I do not want to mix the two issues. It is a particularly difficult time for the families. I have received communications from some members of the groups while other members take different views. However, they are communicating with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I do not want to read off a list of the significant amount of investment in staff, fire and ambulance services in respect of these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not what the individuals want to hear during this week. It is a remembrance of the tragedies of the night. The evidence of what has happened was found in the intervening period. However, it has been a long period and the service is entirely different and invested in now. The Government will continue to keep in touch with the families as is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="56"/>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Taoiseach that he is not mixing two issues. The relatives certainly want to know whether lessons have been learned.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke about other countries and their tragedies but it is painful to realise that Ireland has the highest rate of fire accidents in the EU and one of the worst in the world. Ireland has 58 fire related deaths on average per year. The United Kingdom spends twice as much <i>per capita</i> in this area, as this country. We have not learned the lessons.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s talk about reform and change, there has been change. We have dozens more pubs, more concert venues, bigger stadia and more hotels but for this city and county on any typical night we only have one fire prevention officer on the north side of the Liffey river and one on the south side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not concluded on this matter. The Ceann Comhairle must allow me one last question.</P>
      <P>This situation has gone from bad to worse since the Stardust disaster. It seems that lessons have not been learned. The Taoiseach talks about everything being fine; it is not fine. The Dublin fire brigade service had 11 ambulances then and has 11 ambulances now. Basically, there is one person per ambulance, meaning that, if there were to be any disaster with more than 11 people involved, the rest would be left on the side of the road to get taxis or anything else they could manage to reach a hospital.</P>
      <P>The situation is dire. The current Government &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il was in Government then &mdash; should certainly learn the lessons. I ask that the Taoiseach address the issue. He should meet the relations and double the number of ambulances and fire prevention officers. Anything else is irresponsible.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The fire service&rsquo;s ambulance service has radically changed. There have been massive improvements and significant additions to the fire service, such as fire appliances, emergency service rescue equipment. There have been improvements in the number of personnel involved and the level of training and the number of facilities in Marino, Athlone, Bray, Clonmel <Col N="57"/>and some of the other parts of the country. All of the figures are in the public domain</P>
      <P>This is not to say, as the Deputy believes I am saying, that everything is fine and there are no problems. When dealing with tragedies and fires and in spite of the fact that the Stardust changed the attitudes in this country totally in terms of regulations, planning permission, new buildings and inspections, it is an entirely different position now than it was then but it does not mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that people can ever stop. There are 3,400 fire service personnel in the country compared to quite small numbers in many areas then. Premises are being inspected. The new Building Control Bill 2005 deals with a significant number of issues. I reiterate that the Government is very sensitive to the families.</P>

I support the opposition to the proposition put before us, as articulated by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea. This matter merits a full and participatory debate and it is all too seldom we have the opportunity to debate matters and measures on the Irish language and its application in the affairs of State. This is a further opportunity to examine the proposed introduction of regulations on the Irish language. Accordingly, I join my colleagues in opposing the proposition as presented.</P>

	<P>Today we read the story of a school that had to pay &euro;10,000 to parents of a child who was bullied. Since I raised the matter of the Martin report on indiscipline in schools, I have received a flood of correspondence from teachers and parents. Indiscipline seems to be endemic in some schools and is an issue that should be <Col N="60"/>debated in this House. When will the Martin report on indiscipline be published?</P>
      <P>I am concerned at a trend that seems to be emerging. The advice given by the Attorney General to the Government seems not to have been adhered to. For example, random breath testing was unconstitutional before Christmas but it is now both constitutional and legal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>His advice to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to go to the United Nations in an effort to close down Sellafield was the wrong avenue and the Minister is now taking Britain and the European Commission to court.</P>

	<P>It does. I am aware that the Ceann Comhairle is from a land-locked county and that, if Ted Nealon&rsquo;s guide is correct, it is his birthday so I am going to give some flexibility. The advice given by the Attorney General was that it was impossible to introduce administrative fines in the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill.</P>

	<P>It emerged last week the Government does not know whether it is coming or going on the M50. I would like to hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s views on legislation promised by the Secretary General of the Department at the Committee of Public Accounts. When will this legislation be before the House? Will it come before the House before the reshuffle of Ministers of State? The legislation would be concerned with whatever tolling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy referring to the infrastructure Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in the Taoiseach asking me. I do not know. The Taoiseach did not seem to know last week and the Minister for Transport now says it is not what he said on television at 9 o&rsquo;clock. I do not know. There is no point asking me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is making it up as he goes along.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="62"/>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Government view of this? The unfortunate, hard-pressed motorist on the M50 certainly does not know and I have said that if the Minister raises four gantries, he will be strung up on one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is anyone surprised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If they want a consultation on it, that is all right by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is promised legislation on freeflow on the M50, which will come forward in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, this is not a response worthy of the Taoiseach. I asked a simple question, which the Ceann Comhairle accepts is admissible. When will the legislation be before the House?</P>
      <P>While I am on my feet and the Taoiseach is receiving a more precise answer, what is the impediment to creating some new vacancies among these underworked Ministers of State and promoting some eager backbenchers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow the Taoiseach to answer his question on legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any help the Opposition can give as the vacuum created is becoming embarrassing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the first question is 2006 and, regarding the second question, I am keeping the vacancy open for Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised a matter of promised legislation for several years. The response is always that the legislation is pending, coming soon or that the legislation is large and difficult. This matter dates back to 1990, before I was elected to this House. According to reports, the Abbey Theatre will have charitable status. Legally, this requires a charities regulation Bill. The previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not introduce the Bill and I wonder if the incumbent will introduce it. Is it the case that it has been introduced unofficially and we have not been informed of this? I would like to know whether it will be published this year as we have been told. Will the Taoiseach give us an assurance? It has slipped year by year. If it is not brought forward this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="63"/>

	<P>The Taoiseach will answer the question on legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in indicating a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is due to be published this year.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Before Christmas the Taoiseach promised us that the electricity Bill was due to come before the House in the next session. However, suddenly and mysteriously it disappeared off the promised legislation paper. What was the cause of this? Did the Minister get an electric shock? Has he seen or heard something that has convinced him to do nothing in this area? Will the Taoiseach give an indication as to whether the Deloitte &amp; Touche report is likely to be incorporated in that legislation or the Single Electricity Market Bill, the only similar Bill on the cl&aacute;r?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe it was promised last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was promised several times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation is still under discussion and will take some considerable time to complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was promised, with publication expected in mid-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Taoiseach may not be embarrassed by the M50 debacle, I wonder whether he is embarrassed by the fact that elderly people and their relatives come to our clinics wondering when they will receive the money robbed from them. I am embarrassed because I told them the legislation would be introduced last autumn. That was what the Minister for Health and Children told me. I then told them it would be introduced before Christmas because that was what I was told by the Minister for Health and Children. When exactly can we tell them that they will get back their money which was robbed from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste advises me that the legislation will be before the House this session. The scheme to pay out should be in place this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the fact that the so-called Independent Monitoring Commission has now been discredited and the fact that it is <Col N="64"/>the child of British securocrats, will the Taoiseach support an Independent Monitoring Commission repeal Bill brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies last week? Will he allow Government time to take it and will he support it?</P>
      <P>Regarding the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill which is indicated in the current schedule for legislation and expected in mid-2006, will the Taoiseach indicate whether it will be addressed in the course of this or the subsequent term of this D&aacute;il?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill is due to be published this summer. Regarding the first issue, there is no proposal for change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is before a committee and does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>In support of Deputy Perry, the committee debate on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 collapsed this morning. We heard a fine valedictory speech from the outgoing Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, who apparently has a different legal opinion from the Taoiseach. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has a third legal opinion and the Attorney General a fourth.</P>

For this to happen a number of legislative proposals on the desk of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government since July must be enacted. The Taoiseach will agree that this is important and must happen. The legislation concerns the common areas of flat complexes, service charges and changes to the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978. When will we see these changes come before the House?</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill 2006: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce my second Finance Bill at a time when our country is doing well, both economically and socially. The radical restructuring of the tax system which has taken place since 1997 has contributed considerably to the progress we have made. However, even a successful system requires that the relevant policies be adapted to changing times, that the system itself be maintained and protected and that, wherever necessary, the tax system be evaluated and reformed. Budget 2006 and this Finance Bill deliver on these three key requirements.</P>
      <P>The policies of recent years have delivered a personal tax environment that fosters and supports effort and enterprise. For those on average pay, it has delivered one of the lowest tax wedges <Col N="70"/>in the OECD area as well as taking many taxpayers out of the tax net entirely. It is no coincidence that since 1997 over 600,000 new jobs have been created and unemployment has been reduced from over 10% to a predicted 4.3% for this year while we expect the numbers in employment will increase by 60,000 in 2006. Tax policies framed in an employment friendly fashion have played a big part in achieving these impressive results. The personal tax changes in this Bill continue in this direction, as I will demonstrate later. Measures are also being introduced to ensure the tax system continues to operate effectively and to protect the system from unwarranted avoidance of taxes by the few.</P>
      <P>There is much reform in this Finance Bill, for example, reform of tax incentives, reform of pension tax arrangements, reform of the tax treatment of high incomes to ensure individuals who are among the highest earners in the country do not use various tax reliefs to avoid paying any significant tax and reform of tax administration to ensure the system is not abused.</P>
      <P>A large part of these reforms build on the review of tax schemes which I have had carried out over the past year, the reports of which were published yesterday. Last October, I made clear my commitment to a high standard of public financial management when I launched a series of initiatives in relation to public expenditure. In dealing with special tax incentives, I have sought to apply the same sharp focus on efficiency and value for money based on the review. Approximately two dozen separate schemes were investigated and the public can see in the studies which were undertaken the basis of some important decisions announced in budget 2006 and put into legislation in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The various area-based property schemes were targeted at many areas throughout the State. Currently the urban renewal scheme has 49 areas in 42 towns and cities designated for relief. The town renewal scheme has areas in 100 towns designated for relief spread across all counties with the exception of Counties Longford, Leitrim and Dublin. The rural renewal scheme includes all of Counties Longford and Leitrim, north County Roscommon, parts of south and east County Sligo and west County Cavan. The present living over the shop scheme is confined to the city council areas of Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Waterford and Galway &mdash; in total 12.7 km of street length are designated for relief under this scheme.</P>
      <P>Among the landmark schemes of the urban renewal tax schemes were the following: in Dublin, the development of the Custom House docks area as a location for a thriving financial services centre with high-quality buildings, the development of the rundown area of Temple Bar as a key part of Dublin&rsquo;s tourist attractions, the successful development of Tallaght town centre and, more recently, the major development of the Harp area in Smithfield in which over &euro;200 mil<Col N="71"/>lion was invested between 1999 and 2004. Outside Dublin, the various urban renewal schemes have helped to revitalise and transform the inner city areas of Galway and Limerick, in particular.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear in this context that I am committed to having an <i>ex-ante</i> cost-benefit assessment of any new schemes and I am also in favour of time limits on schemes, as recommended in the reviews. However, I do not believe it is necessary to provide in the legislation on any particular scheme that there must be a cost-benefit analysis for that scheme. Indeed, the consultants recommended a continuation of the existing tax reliefs for private hospitals, nursing homes and child care facilities without suggesting a time limit for these particular schemes. As I said, I agree with cost-benefit analysis of and time limits on new schemes but they are a matter for Government practice rather than statutory provision.</P>
      <P>A picture has been painted by some commentators and certain Opposition spokespersons of a tax system which has resulted in the emergence of a substantial body of high income individuals who pay little or no tax. That is a distortion of the position. Despite assertions to the contrary, the position is that those who earn more contribute more to the income tax yield than was the case in 1997 when we took office. It is estimated that in 2006, the top 1% of income earners will pay approximately 20% of all income tax collected. In the 1997-98 tax year, the top 1% paid less than 15% of all income tax collected.</P>
      <P>In the same period, the contribution of lower earners to the income tax yield has reduced significantly. Those earning at or under the average industrial wage will pay 6% of the expected income tax yield for 2006 as compared with over 14% in 1997 when we took office. A small number of individuals with very high incomes have been able up to now, through the use of tax incentives and reliefs, to reduce their income tax liability to a very low level or to zero. However, this is precisely what I am addressing in this Bill which will ensure that from 2007 such individuals will generally have an average tax rate of not less than about 20%.</P>
      <P>Under this Government&rsquo;s management, we have given money back to the taxpayer. We have become less reliant on taxes on labour to fund Government expenditure. In 1997, income tax represented 37% of total Exchequer tax revenue while taxes of a capital nature represented less than 5%. In 2005, income tax as a proportion of total tax revenue was less than 29% while the tax take from capital taxes and stamp duties increased to approximately 13% of total tax take.</P>
      <P>As regards the SSIA scheme, it is amusing to see the two leading Opposition spokespersons now criticising as insufficient the new initiative in the Finance Bill for encouraging SSIA holders to invest their SSIA savings into pension schemes <Col N="72"/>when one considers what they said in the past about this very successful savings scheme.</P>
      <P>In his reply to the 2003 Budget Statement, Deputy Bruton was critical of the amount of money going into the SSIAs. He also criticised the fact that the specified amount of money was still being invested every year into the National Pensions Reserve Fund. Deputy Burton in the same debate in December 2002 complained that nothing was being done to curtail the cost of SSIAs. Two months earlier in October 2002, she had described the SSIA scheme as most ridiculous.</P>
      <P>The economic background against which this Bill is being presented is encouragingly benign. The economy is forecast to grow by 4.6% this year. We have one of the healthiest fiscal positions in the EU with a low debt to GDP ratio and substantial savings in the form of the National Pensions Reserve Fund being put aside to meet future pension needs.</P>
      <P>This benign scenario is subject to a number of downside risks.</P>
      <P>As Ireland is a small and open economy, we are especially exposed to changes in the global economic environment. The prospect of further appreciation of the euro as well as increasing oil prices are causes for concern. If the increased oil prices are sustained, the subsequent fall in world demand could be expected to have some negative impact on Irish economic growth.</P>
      <P>The risks I have outlined are effectively beyond our control. Therefore it is vital that we focus on those domestic factors which we can control so as to counter possible negative developments. I am concerned about the decline in cost competitiveness in recent years. This has an impact on employment in the exposed sectors of the economy. A vital part of competitiveness is the cost of doing business in Ireland. If Ireland&rsquo;s inflation rate exceeds that of our competitor countries, our businesses will not be able to expand and provide the jobs that will help us provide the standard of living we want in Ireland. We must ensure that future wage increases are in line with productivity improvements if we are to prevent further deterioration in our competitive position.</P>
      <P>Sustaining economic growth and maintaining full employment in the Irish economy are Government priorities. Low inflation, responsible fiscal policies and effective investment are central to this objective. The Government will keep the public finances in a healthy condition and will keep down personal and business taxes to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy. We will continue to address our infrastructural deficit to safeguard the future economic well-being of our country. To this end, our rate of public investment will remain at almost twice the EU average as a percentage of gross national product. However, prudent management of the public finances remains essential in achieving all these priorities. In this context, <Col N="73"/>increases in public expenditure must be carefully managed with, as I have stressed, a strong focus on ensuring enhanced efficiency, accountability, transparency and value for money. Of particular importance is the need to ensure that public expenditure grows broadly in line with available resources.</P>
      <P>While respecting these parameters, the Government is committed to concentrating the resources available to it on improving the quality of public services and delivering further real improvements to pensioners and people on low incomes. We took important steps in that regard in the budget. The Economic and Social Research Institute&rsquo;s analysis indicates that this was &ldquo;perhaps the most progressive budget package for many years &mdash; poorer households did proportionately better than rich ones&rdquo;. Our economic performance in recent years leaves us in a position of strength to deal with the challenges we may face in the coming years and in addressing the risks which I have outlined.</P>
      <P>This year&rsquo;s Finance Bill, when passed, will remove all those on the minimum wage from the tax net &mdash; 90,000 people; exclude workers on the average industrial wage from the higher tax rate &mdash; 55,000 people would enter the higher tax rate were this action not taken; confirm the restrictions on the use of tax reliefs by high income taxpayers to secure greater equity in the tax system; phase out various existing tax schemes and exemptions; and end the current remittance basis of taxation. It will continue the stamp duty exemption for young trained farmers for a further three years, increase the tax exemption limits for income from farm leasing for over five years and extend certain existing reliefs to cover the EU single farm payment entitlement in appropriate circumstances.</P>
      <P>This Bill will also introduce a new scheme of tax relief for heritage property donated to the proposed Irish Heritage Trust. It will provide for income tax disregard for certain people minding children in their own home as announced in the budget and will adjust the rules governing &ldquo;top-hat&rdquo; pension provisions and approved retirement funds. The Bill will increase VAT registration thresholds to help small business, exempt biofuels from excise duties and reduce excise duties on certain home heating oils, including kerosene and LPG. These measures were announced in budget 2006.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Bill will introduce a new initiative designed to encourage low income earners who hold SSIA accounts to transfer funds into pension schemes and will provide significant improvements in the film tax relief aimed at enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position as a film location. It will provide for automatic reporting by financial institutions and Departments of interest and certain other payments made to taxpayers. The Bill will provide for a surcharge of 10% in certain circumstances on undisclosed tax <Col N="74"/>avoidance schemes. It will ensure that landlords will be obliged to meet their statutory registration requirements as a condition of getting generous tax relief and will tighten up the relevant contracts tax to discourage fraud and tax evasion. The Bill will include a range of provisions to facilitate business, including the financial services sector in particular, to assist in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in these sectors and to create more jobs. It will also close off a series of abusive tax loopholes in the areas of film leasing, transfer of Irish assets into a foreign company, capital gains tax and VAT grouping.</P>
      <P>The Bill consists of 122 sections and two Schedules. In the time available to me today, I will outline some of its main provisions. I will listen carefully to Deputies&rsquo; contributions and will try to respond to their points in my reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>On income tax, the various income tax measures and reliefs announced in the budget are dealt with in sections 2 to 7, inclusive. These widen the tax bands and increase various credits, including the basic personal credit and employee tax credit. The effect will be a reduction in average tax rates and removal of those on the current minimum wage from the tax net.</P>
      <P>Section 8 revises the tax relief provisions in respect of local authority waste charges to maintain the value of the relief for taxpayers following the introduction of the &ldquo;pay by use&rdquo; principle. The existing provisions governing the relief require adjustment to take account of the revised charges structure at local level.</P>
      <P>Section 9 deals with the budget day announcement and financial resolution which abolishes the relief for interest on loans taken out to acquire an interest in property rental income companies after 7 December 2005.</P>
      <P>Section 11 links mortgage interest relief on rental properties to the registration requirements of the Private Residential Tenancies Board so as to encourage compliance with the registration requirement. Section 13 confirms the budget day announcement of a childminding relief for individuals minding up to three children in their own home, provided the income in question does not exceed &euro;10,000 in the tax year.</P>
      <P>Section 14 contains a number of important changes to the tax treatment of pension provision. First, the rate of age-based tax relief applying to all pension products is being increased where the contributor was 55 years old or over at any time during the tax year, to 35% of net earnings or remuneration, and to 40% for those aged 60 and over. This is aimed at incentivising individuals who have underfunded their pension over the years and now wish to improve their position as they approach retirement. The overall benefit limit of two thirds of final salary will still apply.</P>
      <P>Second, the current annual earnings limit of &euro;254,000 for certain contributions to pension schemes is to be indexed from the tax year 2007 to maintain its value in the future. Third, an <Col N="75"/>annual taxable 3% imputed distribution is being applied to the value of assets in approved retirement funds. This will be phased in over three years. Fourth, the maximum tax-free lump sum for draw-downs from a pension fund made on or after 7 December 2005 will be &euro;1.25 million. A cap is placed on the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes, at &euro;5 million or, if higher, the value of the fund on 7 December 2005.</P>
      <P>Section 15 provides for the discontinuance of the remittance basis of taxation with effect from 1 January 2006 in respect of employment income in so far as the employment is exercised in the State.</P>
      <P>Section 17 provides for the measure announced in the budget which will place a limit on the use of tax reliefs by those on high incomes. The measure will ensure that such taxpayers will not be able to use specified tax reliefs to reduce their tax bill in any year below approximately 20%. A full list of the reliefs which are covered is included in the Bill. Broadly, these consist of the various property based reliefs and other incentive reliefs such as film relief, the business expansion scheme and donations. However, the normal expenses of business, including standard depreciation allowances and losses, will still be allowed in the normal way.</P>
      <P>Section 18 provides for significant improvements in the relief for investment in film production. The percentage of expenditure that is eligible for tax relief is being raised to 80% for all films, up from the existing levels of 55% or 66%, depending on the film budget. In addition, the ceiling on qualifying expenditure for any one film is being increased from &euro;15 million to &euro;35 million. These improvements are subject to European Commission approval.</P>
      <P>Section 19 increases the annual cap on the amount that can be claimed for expenditure on farm pollution control measures to the lesser of &euro;50,000 or 50% of qualifying expenditure, with effect from 1 January 2006.</P>
      <P>Section 20 extends the scheme of tax relief for donations to approved bodies to include the donation of publicly quoted securities, which will be treated in much the same way as cash donations of equivalent value.</P>
      <P>As my budget day announcement noted, section 22 abolishes the stallion and greyhound tax exemptions from 31 July 2008. Discussions will take place with the industry and the European Commission on a replacement scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 23 includes the proposed Irish Heritage Trust in the list of approved bodies for the purpose of the tax relief on donations scheme. This will facilitate the trust in building up an endowment fund for the maintenance of its heritage properties. Three other provisions relate to the trust and are contained in sections 66, 107 and 116.</P><Col N="76"/>
      <P>Sections 24 to 33, inclusive, set out the termination dates and transitional arrangements relating to various tax relieved property schemes, the details of which were announced on budget day. Sections 34 to 38, inclusive, deal with capital allowances for private hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes and child care facilities. I am extending the clawback period for these facilities from ten to 15 years and the &ldquo;tax life&rdquo; rules will be revised to facilitate investors in transferring their interests to other investors within the 15 year clawback period. These provisions will apply to facilities commencing in use after 31 July 2006.</P>
      <P>Sections 39 and 40 set out requirements for those who wish to invest some or all of their SSIA funds in a pension product. The purpose of this initiative is to encourage SSIA holders on the lower end of the income scale to provide themselves with improved retirement arrangements by transferring moneys from their SSIA accounts into pensions. A total of &euro;1 will be added for every &euro;3 transferred from an eligible SSIA account into a personal retirement savings account, PRSA, a retirement annuity contract or an additional voluntary contribution, AVC, subject to a maximum bonus of &euro;2,500. In addition, the exit tax to be paid on the SSIA moneys so transferred into individuals&rsquo; pension accounts will be refunded. The scheme is aimed at lower earners and will not be available to 42% taxpayers who have access to considerable incentives. There will be restrictions on the scheme, in particular that the incentive will not be available to fund regular normal pension contributions. This bonus is for making a new additional contribution. This is a once-off special pensions initiative relating to lower earners with SSIA funds. The wider issues relating to improving global pension coverage, as discussed in the recent report of the Pensions Board, will be examined by the Government in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Section 41 amends the law relating to relevant contracts tax, RCT, which principal contractors are obliged to deduct from payments made to certain subcontractors in the construction, meat processing and forestry sectors in order to tighten controls and discourage fraud and evasion. Applicants for C2 certificates will face more stringent application criteria, while the payment limit Revenue operates for some subcontractors regarding C2 payments is being put on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Sections 42 to 44, inclusive, 49, 57 and 99 provide for measures of a substantive, clarificatory and technical nature to assist in the development of the funds industry in Ireland, an important part of the international financial services sector. Section 45 amends legislative changes included in the Finance Act 2005 to ensure the 23% exit tax on the proceeds of a life assurance policy cannot be deferred indefinitely by the continual rolling over of a policy without <Col N="77"/>it becoming chargeable to the tax. The changes respond to certain points made to me by the industry but I am determined to ensure the tax deferral available to investors is reasonable and definite.</P>
      <P>Section 50 ensures life assurance companies only benefit from group losses and certain other loss reliefs at the corporation tax rate of 12.5% as opposed to the standard income tax rate of 20% which applies for the income and gains of policyholders from such policies. Section 51 is aimed at preventing abuses of the patent income exemption through recategorising franchise licence fees as patent royalty payments and also limits the amount of exempt patent royalty distributions that may be made by a company in certain circumstances to the aggregate of its research and development spend over a three-year period.</P>
      <P>Section 53 removes the requirement to deduct withholding tax on interest paid on quoted registered Eurobonds, bringing the treatment of such bonds into line with that of those in bearer form. Section 54 provides for the ring-fencing of losses and capital allowances in qualifying shipping trades. Section 55 gives effect to the 2005 EU mergers directive which broadens the scope of the original reliefs in the 1990 EU mergers directive. Section 56 makes a number of minor additional amendments to the provisions dealing with the tax aspects of the move, by companies, to the new international financial reporting standards, IFRS.</P>
      <P>Section 58 gives effect to the budget announcement on the restriction of interest relief under section 247 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in the context of transactions between related companies. This is an important measure to block off avoidance attempts but I appreciate that the section 247 relief is being used by firms in a perfectly appropriate way. It is not my intention to cut off genuine use of the section.</P>
      <P>Section 59 deals with the research and development tax credit. The section provides that a proportion of expenditure on machinery or plant which is to be used partly for research and development will qualify for the tax credit. Where plant and machinery are included in the incremental spending calculation but are in dual use in both research and development and production, there will be a proportionate allocation of the expenditure for the purposes of the credit. The section also makes additional provision in regard to the credit which is only one of the Government&rsquo;s actions in incentivising the development of research and development in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Section 60 improves the legislation on the taxation of shipping-related profits by providing for a clearer, more streamlined process for applicant companies electing for the tonnage tax regime. Section 61 introduces measures to increase the scope of income against which losses and capital <Col N="78"/>allowances in the big ticket leasing sector can be offset.</P>
      <P>Turning to capital gains tax, section 63 gives effect to the budget proposal that the EU single farm payment entitlement will qualify as an asset for the purposes of the capital gains tax retirement relief, provided the farmer in question fulfils the ten-year rule in regard to the ownership and usage of the land which is disposed of at the same time as that entitlement. The section also caters for the situation where a husband and wife are co-owners of land but only one of them becomes a partner in a milk production partnership.</P>
      <P>Section 66 deals with relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of certain works of art where prior to the disposal they were on loan to and displayed in an approved gallery or museum. The minimum period of loan is being increased from six to ten years and the section is being extended to apply also to such loans made to the proposed Irish Heritage Trust.</P>
      <P>Section 68 is an anti-avoidance measure dealing with capital gains tax in certain circumstances of a disposal of a chargeable asset to a spouse, a separated spouse or a former spouse. Section 69 and 70 provide that the Revenue Commissioners can obtain information for capital gains tax purposes regarding the issue of shares to the members of a mutual life assurance company or a mutual building society on the occasion of these ceasing to be mutual companies.</P>
      <P>Parts 2 and 3 deal with indirect taxes, that is, excise and VAT. These include sections 71 to 84, inclusive, which set out a range of changes in regard to excise duties, including confirmation of the budget day reduction in excise duty on kerosene and LPG used for heating and the reduction of betting duty from 2% to 1% with the industry bearing the liability. In recognition of the environmental issues we face the House will welcome the large-scale scheme I have provided for in the Bill to promote biofuels. This is complemented by providing a new VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles and the extension of the existing relief to dual electric-petrol vehicles.</P>
      <P>Sections 85 to 94, inclusive, contain a number of important revisions to the VAT code. Sections 88 and 94 confirm the increases in the VAT registration thresholds for small businesses from 1 May 2006. The revised thresholds are &euro;27,500 in the case of services and &euro;55,000 in the case of goods. Sections 87 and 89 amend the VAT Act to provide for the taxation of the private use of deductible and non-deductible business services. Section 88 also contains an anti-avoidance measure designed to strengthen the VAT grouping provisions so as to ensure the related companies are appropriately grouped for VAT purposes. Sections 86, 90 and 92 replace the existing rules regarding the VAT treatment of the supply of a &ldquo;package&rdquo; of services comprised of two or more <Col N="79"/>elements which attract VAT at different rates. Sections 91 and 92 provide for the granting of deductibility for VAT incurred on costs associated with the issue of new stocks, shares, debentures and other securities made to raise capital where that person is entitled to VAT deductibility.</P>
      <P>Part 4 deals with stamp duties. Section 96 extends to a foster child the stamp duty reliefs available to a natural or an adopted child. Section 97 provides for an amendment to the exemption from stamp duty of any instrument made for the purposes of or in connection with the demutualisation of an assurance company which carries on a mutual life business. Section 98 gives effect to the budget announcement extending the exemption for transfers of land to young trained farmers from stamp duty for another three years until 31 December 2008. Section 101 provides for an exemption from stamp duty on the sale, transfer or other disposition of an EU single farm payment entitlement. Section 102 gives effect to the budget announcement regarding the abolition of companies capital duty for transactions effected on or after 7 December 2005. Section 103 ensures that where a combined ATM and debit card is used solely as an ATM or debit card, the charge will be &euro;10, whereas if it is used for both functions, the existing &euro;20 charge will apply.</P>
      <P>Part 5 deals with capital acquisition tax. Section 107 is concerned with the clawback of the exemption granted to heritage objects contained in a gift or inheritance if such objects are sold within six years after the valuation date of the gift or inheritance. This clawback does not apply if the objects are sold by private treaty to one of the qualifying bodies referred to in section 77(3) of the Act and the proposed Irish Heritage Trust is now being added to the list of qualifying bodies.</P>
      <P>Section 110 gives effect to the budget proposal that the EU single farm payment entitlement will qualify as agricultural property for the purposes of agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax rules. It also provides that, where land which qualified for agricultural relief or business relief, as the case may be, is disposed of in the period commencing six years after the date of the gift or inheritance and ending ten years after that date, the relief granted will be clawed back in respect of the development value of the land at the date of the gift or inheritance.</P>
      <P>Section 111 amends the provision which grants a credit for capital gains tax that has been paid against capital acquisitions tax where those taxes are chargeable on the same property and arise on the same event. This credit will cease to apply where the gift or inheritance is subsequently disposed of by the beneficiary within two years of its acquisition.</P>
      <P>Section 114 provides a new scheme of tax relief for heritage property donated to the proposed Irish Heritage Trust as announced in the budget. <Col N="80"/>To qualify for relief, the heritage property will have to be approved by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by reference to the criteria set out in the section. There will be a ceiling of &euro;6 million on the aggregate value of the heritage properties that can be approved in any one year. Allowing the proposed trust to avail of this scheme will be important to its successful launch.</P>
      <P>Sections 117 and 118 are important tax administration provisions. The first of these will allow the Revenue Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to introduce regulations governing the automatic reporting to Revenue by financial institutions of interest and other profit payments made to customers as well as certain payments made by Departments. The Revenue Commissioners and my Department will consult the financial institutions before implementing this reporting system. Section 118 addresses the use of tax avoidance schemes by way of a surcharge of 10% on undisclosed transactions that are ultimately determined to be tax avoidance transactions. The surcharge will not apply where full details of the transaction are disclosed in a &ldquo;protective notification&rdquo; to Revenue within a specified time limit. People who are open about their tax planning arrangements will be able to show them to Revenue, and will not be surcharged if the arrangements concerned are later determined to be in breach of anti-avoidance rules.</P>
      <P>I hope the House has benefited from this elaboration of the measures in the Bill. There are still some matters under consideration that I may bring forward on Committee Stage should they receive Cabinet approval. At this stage, they remain part of the deliberative process. Should I have such amendments to bring forward, I will seek to notify Opposition spokespersons in advance of the Committee Stage. I will also give consideration to any constructive suggestions put forward during our debate today and tomorrow. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on the opportunity to introduce the second Finance Bill. While it contains some positive provisions, which I welcome, it contains some negative ones, which I do not welcome. Given the nature of these debates, the time restriction and others reasons, I will concentrate more on the negative aspects.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a further extension of the various property-based tax reliefs. This is happening, even though the Government has known for years that these tax reliefs had outlived their usefulness. It was already evident in 2000 that these reliefs had run out of rope. Naturally, the Minister for Finance at the time left it until after the general election to introduce his decision to curb them and bring them to an end. He did so at the end of 2002, shortly after the election. These reliefs were to come definitively to an end <Col N="81"/>in 2004. However, the Government changed its mind a year later, when it extended the timescale from 2004 to 2006. We are now seeing a further extension, albeit on a partial basis, to 2008. An idea conceived of in 2002 to bring these tax reliefs to an end because they were being abused will be strung out over a subsequent six year period before they will be discontinued.</P>
      <P>No doubt the Minister for Finance will say he did not know definitively that these reliefs were such bad value for money and targeted at the well-off. However, that rings very hollow. It was clear from an early stage that these provisions were very focused on an industry that was already extremely strong, and the so-called social benefits were diminishing. It was also very clear that it was particularly high income people who were benefiting. I sought in the past to put a cap of &euro;100,000 on what any individual could take by way of these tax reliefs, which was rejected by the Government.</P>
      <P>This aspect is not news. For the Government, the Taoiseach or anyone else to come into the D&aacute;il and say they did not know about it and they are acting in a timely way is not true and the evidence does not support it. While the Minister for Finance knew in 2001 that these tax reliefs needed to be curbed, successive renewals and extensions were given without any effort to carry out the necessary evaluation. Yesterday&rsquo;s report must be viewed in this context. The Minister cannot claim plaudits at this stage for phasing out these reliefs four years after the Minister and the Government signalled they needed to be discontinued.</P>
      <P>The amount of money involved is mind-boggling. I recall the Revenue Commissions referring to &euro;200 million at most. The figure for the past five years is &euro;1.6 billion, which is a huge sum of money. It is greater than the spending of at least five Departments. If one contrasts the scrutiny by the Minister&rsquo;s Department of any of the five Departments, compared to the scrutiny which was not carried out of the expenditure of this money year in, year out, one will become aware of the extraordinary contrast in the way the Department of Finance considers spending as against taxation. However, it is coming out of taxpayers&rsquo; pockets in the same way, which is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>It is scary to read in the Indecon report that the net tax forgone was more than double the total tax benefits across the 11 schemes examined. We were paying far too much for the benefits. We were paying twice as much for the benefits as should have been the case, which was a very bad return. The study indicated that while &euro;4 billion has been invested under these schemes, another &euro;6 billion will be invested under the various extensions the Minister for Finance introduced when he started to roll it forward from 2002 and 2004. He has brought &euro;6.5 billion extra into these schemes in the period after he identified they <Col N="82"/>should be discontinued. An avalanche of money has been invested in these schemes in that time. The Government facilitated this and it cannot be defended.</P>
      <P>Its impact on tax equity has been very severe. The Minister is trying to say that people who criticise it are pretending wealthy people do not pay tax, which is not the issue. We are all aware that most wealthy people pay tax, but a small minority have used these schemes to the hilt. Unfortunately, even with the Minister&rsquo;s concession, I do not believe he is going far enough to deal with the issue. One can still invest &euro;250,000 in a scheme, plus &euro;250,000 through a pension fund. Some &euro;500,000 is still allowable without a cent of tax being paid. It is only after that amount the Minister will put some restriction on these investors, which is an extraordinarily high income. At that level, one is talking about a tiny minority of people with mega money, which does not square up to the ordinary person&rsquo;s view of tax equity. Even though the Minister said he wants to achieve tax equity, this is not a practical way of achieving it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said on the radio this morning, and again here today, that he agrees there should be a sunset clause and a cost-benefit analysis before any extension of tax relief is introduced. However, he appears to be saying, &ldquo;Make me virtuous, Lord, but not just yet&rdquo;, which is the problem. The Minister decided to extend the film relief in the Finance Bill. I do not know whether it is a good or bad idea. His predecessor thought it was a bad idea. He produced some sort of cost-benefit analysis from the Revenue Commissioners to back up his view that it was a bad idea. He pulled the rug from under people who had certain expectations, but there was a universal belief across all the benches that one could not pull the rug from under people.</P>
      <P>The Minister is introducing a new concession without carrying out any cost-benefit analysis. I did not hear anyone saying that the film industry deserves more reliefs. I have heard people saying that it is difficult to bring film-makers here, but that is a different issue. Cost-benefit analyses must be carried out before introducing any concessions.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he will extend the tax reliefs to private nursing homes and child care facilities for another few years. He has not proposed an end to this. The Minister has not indicated if it will be for three years, four years or whatever, nor has he said we need a proper cost benefit analysis. I do not know if the Minister has read them but I have looked hard at the cost benefit analyses that were carried out and they do not ring true as being the sort of analysis we ought to have to make sure that the concessions to private hospitals and nursing homes are in the context of the public policy we want to develop in terms of a strong public health system that is equitable. That means, for example, that we <Col N="83"/>should promote public private partnerships, contract out opportunities to deliver within the public system, but by private practitioners. This is not what we are doing here. We are saying we will give tax subsidies to the private sector to do its own thing, which would not necessarily be consistent with public health policy.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We have seen problems with nursing homes and there are clearly public concerns in this regard. If we are to go forward with this approach, and the jury is out on whether it is a good or bad idea &mdash; I suspect it is not a great idea &mdash; we ought to have the kind of real analysis that is required in the context of the type of health policy we wish to pursue and ensure that it is the right way to go. It may be &mdash; I will not prejudge it &mdash; but the Minister has not done that and if he was genuine about wanting to see this, he would start now. I accept that one of his colleagues in Government believes it is the right thing to do but we need to see that stood up.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a barbed comment in regard to the pension relief issue to the effect that it is extraordinary that I would be critical of this. Quite honestly, I am critical of this, for the reason I outlined earlier. The Minister is willing to give people who have substantial income, &euro;32,000 every year for their pension fund. It is not just a once off payment for people who are well placed enough to set up pension funds because he has proposed to index this system so that the sum would increase every year. In contrast, he is saying to people who are at the bottom of the scale, who do not have any pension fund, that he will put in, at most, &euro;2,500. The contrast between those two positions is dramatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is in respect of SSIAs on account maturity. The wider general pension provision is still under consideration by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>This was the opportunity to give a serious kick-start to pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>We need that one-for-one scheme. I would support that. I do not know the position of other parties in the House but the Fine Gael Party would support it. We have advocated that and the Pensions Board has endorsed it. The Finance Bill should contain such a provision. The Minister&rsquo;s scheme is confined to people on the 20% rate of tax so half the tax paying population is automatically ruled out. He has not delivered the promise in regard to people who pay tax above the standard rate and he is capping the sum that can be invested at &euro;2,500. People who have no pensions and those who could not afford to have an SSIA, which is a huge swathe of those who have no pensions, are entirely excluded. I will not turn it down but it will not make the sort <Col N="84"/>of impact the Minister could have made on the pension issue this year when it would have been timely to do so. It would also have been sensible to try to pull a considerable amount of money out of the SSIA to prevent it being spent in the economy and to have it squirrelled away for the long-term financial security of families. The Minister should have seized that opportunity. If these issues are still under review I suggest that this provision should be re-examined.</P>
      <P>A number of issues arise and I will briefly go through them. I am disappointed the Minister has not tackled the issue of paying back to people the money which has been paid to the Exchequer. If one examines the amount of spending people are incurring on private medical expenses it is clear they are getting tax relief on only about a quarter of medical expenses that are properly tax allowable. That is a scandal. No serious effort is made to refund people who are compliant taxpayers. If the boot was on the other foot and these people had failed to pay hundreds of millions of euro, which is what it tots up to, we would be rightly clamouring for the Revenue to be out after them. The Minister would reply that new powers were required and we would agree to give these new powers.</P>
      <P>The amount of unclaimed tax relief on health alone is probably about &euro;200 million but there is no similar urgency from either the Department or the Revenue Commissioners to put in place ways that would facilitate people in getting this money back, such as, for example, simple chits that could be signed and sent in to the Revenue Commissioners at the time the medical expenses are incurred. Those things are easy to do. If the same imagination was put into making sure that people were not taxed too much, as goes into ensuring that the money due is collected, we would have done these things years ago. The Minister could do much more.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I noted the information on approved retirement fund, ARF, abuse. Will the Minister indicate if it only relates to larger funds? If people have small amounts of money in ARFs, if they are just a standard, common or garden pension provider, does the Minister still want to tax them at 1%, 2% and 3% per annum? I do not quite understand this issue but perhaps the Minister can clarify it when we come to the end of Second Stage or on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Another issue that arises in terms of pensions is employers&rsquo; contributions. Perhaps I am wrong but, as I understand it, one can write off pension on up to &euro;254,000 of one&rsquo;s personal income but there is no ceiling on what an employer can put into the pension fund of a privileged manager. If one is talking about equity, should caps not also be applied to the amount an employer can invest? In many cases, senior management is effectively in a position to decide what the employer does. They are not arms-length arrangements but packages put together by the parties involved and to <Col N="85"/>which the taxpayer contributes a significant amount. Perhaps we should do something in this regard if the aim is to produce equity. I am surprised nothing was done but there may be more to be read in these things that may explain why it was not done.</P>
      <P>The other matter that has raised some eyebrows is the automatic reporting requirement. It appears to me that thresholds should be introduced at some point. The Minister is hardly trying to find out about pensioners who have a few thousand euro on deposit. That is not the purpose for which these powers were intended. In trying to identify problems, a great deal of worry can be generated if there is a belief that Revenue is looking for a few bob from people like that. The Revenue powers report put these powers in the context that one had to prove that it was worthwhile and that the benefits to the Revenue justified what was being asked of people in terms of compliance. All I see in this is an enabling provision; I do not see any cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Those issues can be worked out in the consultation process with the financial institutions. The report also made the point that thresholds could encourage the splitting of accounts. We must be mindful of that. The details will be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps one could also include somebody in the process who could put the consumer&rsquo;s perspective. It is all very well consulting financial institutions but the Minister should also consult people who might have a reasonable view. Perhaps the consumer director in IFSRA would have a view that would uphold the rights of consumers. Much of the compliance headache will be on consumers if this is being reported.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister does not have to make a positive motion to the House in order for the provision to be introduced so it would be necessary for us to annul it. It is the old story that the Minister makes the order and we do not see it. Once the Finance Bill is passed we will not get another chance to find out whether the costs and the benefits were warranted. I have no objection to the power. The case for it was well made, but it was done in the context of reasonableness and of putting tests in the way. When one is using invasive and intrusive powers there have to be tests as to how far one can go and how far it is reasonable to go. I heard somebody refer to the right to an Ombudsman in regard to tax. There is an expectation that while the power may be justified, a test of reasonableness must be included in it. Those tests are not in the Finance Bill as it stands but I take it from what the Minister said that he will assess them.</P>
      <P>An issue that keeps coming back from rural Deputies is that of capital gains tax, CGT, on compulsory purchase order, CPO, land. The Minister has rejected this in the past but it <Col N="86"/>appears to be a continuing concern to rural Deputies and I am sure it will come up again on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I noted the Minister made a concession on the old VAT thresholds but he was not at his most generous the day he rewrote those sections. The money must have been beginning to run out at that stage because it was a fairly small increase.</P>
      <P>The other matter I note in passing is the income disregard for child minders. A concern has been raised as to whether such persons will enjoy social insurance cover. I would have thought they would enjoy such cover, that the Minister is providing an exemption from paying the social insurance levy but that they still enjoy social insurance cover. Perhaps the Minister would clarify in his reply on Second Stage that the exemption from tax and PRSI will not leave such people without proper PRSI cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Would such persons not be better off paying the &euro;250 and getting the credit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I expect the Minister to confirm that such persons will get a full stamp and it is just that the Exchequer is paying it for them. I hope that is what the Minister will state but I do not see a flurry of notes going across from the officials to the Minister to tell us the good news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Keep an eye on the Social Welfare Bill; it is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech contained a self-congratulatory piece on competitiveness. While I welcome his introduction of that issue, Ministers have forgotten some of the hard lessons of the 1980s on the competitiveness challenge. We are a small open economy. Our success depends on being more alert, more agile and more competitive than our competitors. The Government has slipped into the economic equivalent of bad eating habits. It has reduced its exercising and does not want to believe what the weighing scales are showing. The Ministers continually come out with this mantra of the importance of being competitive and as we approach the partnership agreement it is vital to be competitive, but it is vital that they themselves are competitive.</P>
      <P>Taking public sector pricing, since 2002 Government charges have increased by 86% &mdash; approximately eight times the consumer price index, CPI &mdash; and the price of public utilities has increased by 40% &mdash; approximately four times the CPI. While Ministers will always say their bit about the need to keep our wage costs competitive, they need to keep our public sector costs competitive. That is an important issue which the Minister and his colleagues are overlooking. Many people are quite bewildered to see electricity prices and gas prices rising by more that what is justified by international costs. The regulators are pushing these prices up and there is a <Col N="87"/>scepticism growing regarding what exactly the Government is about.</P>
      <P>Similar views exist about the Government&rsquo;s charges. After the general election there was a welter of these charges, resulting in significant upward pressure. The Minister&rsquo;s lecture is appropriate but it should be directed internally towards his 14 colleagues as well as externally towards the wider public.</P>
      <P>Let us be blunt. Our economy is much more fragile than it has been for many years. I accept that the performance is strong, creating 90,000 jobs, but equally we have lost our share in export markets in successive years. This is the third year in a row in which we have lost export share. Our performance in the export markets is the worst since 1974. Construction&rsquo;s share of economic growth is unusually, most would say unsustainably, high. We are walking a tighter and higher wire than in the past. People can correctly state that the economic performance is still strong and the public finances are still strong. The Government deserves a share of the credit, not the exclusive credit which I hear some of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues seeking to claim in imagining that all of us on this side of the House were spendthrifts and wastrels.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are serious threats coming down the line and there is a sense that people are seeing the enterprise strategy, long the envy of other countries, creaking and cracks emerging. There are important jobs that the Minister must perform correctly and we must learn from the past. One of them is avoiding boom and bust fiscal strategies. It was crystal clear that in 2001 the fiscal strategy pursued by the Government of which the Minister was a member was seriously damaging to the economy. It was done with an eye to the election and we had to pay a heavy price afterwards. It was a serious mistake and there are worrying signs that the same sort of thinking is afoot again, with spending high this year and the SSIAs on a roll. We do not want to find that there is this froth in the economy over an 18-month period the residue of which would be a further ratcheting down of our competitiveness, more rip-off and more pressure on prices. That would be a serious blunder and unfortunately there are worrying signs that such is a feature of what is happening.</P>
      <P>The Minister correctly called publicly for the delivery of value for money in the public sector but I cannot see that the action of his Government squares with his call. As I pointed out to him in the past, the expenditure review initiative has just collapsed. Big spending Departments like the Department of Health and Children and the decentralising OPW were exempted from expenditure review. The thinking of the Government is that one ought not bother with how the big guys, who are on a political mission of curing the health service or curing the regional strategy with this <Col N="88"/>flawed decentralisation approach, are spending the money. That is what the Minister is saying and his officials have allowed happen. That is so wrong. It is so wrong that these big spending Departments, which have dominated public spending, should be allowed to not have those demands and scrutiny applied to them. The evaluation should be greater in the Department of Health and Children because that is a Department in which they have trebled the amount of public spending. The Minister is now giving &euro;8,500 for every family to the health service, that is, three times more than what was being given when they took power. Then one finds that he has decided to exempt the Department from expenditure scrutiny. It is indefensible. It is not surprising then that one sees bad value for money. The Minister admitted it. He stated that some of the way in which the health service has been run is totally wrong and some of the agreements in place are totally wrong, and yet he is not putting them under scrutiny and making people accountable for those poor performances. The Minister is on the right track in saying value for money is the core issue but he is not doing the jobs that need to be done to make it happen. There needs to be a much tougher line of approach in getting performance delivery. He is talking about having a system but he states it will not be until 2007 that we will begin to see what Departments are doing with their money. There has been such a litany of projects suffering from poor evaluation and poor project management. The list is well known to all of us. It includes PPARS, Media Lab Europe and the Punchestown project. There is an endless list of projects where evaluation systems and project management systems, which should have been running well and which we learnt from Europe, have been allowed rust. That has happened on the watch of the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>Equally, the Government is not delivering in the key infrastructural areas. We have lost our lead in telecommunications and ports. Ireland is bottom of the leagues on ports, broadband and electricity availability. We have lost ground and we are still unable to spend. While I agree with the Minister that he should spend 5% of GNP, over the past three years he is &euro;2,500 million off that target. He is not bringing forward bankable, decent public projects to tackle our infrastructure deficit in a timely way. Many of these basic measures to make his slogans of &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; and &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo; a reality, are not being taken.</P>
      <P>The same may be said in the case of fostering competition in sheltered sectors. That should be a core approach of Government but the Minister has ducked it, for example, on bus services where there was to be competition. His ministerial colleague, Deputy Brennan, the former Minister for Transport, was going to have bus competition three years ago. Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, who pre<Col N="89"/>ceded Deputy Brennan as Minister, was going to have it five years ago. Here we are in 2006 and nothing has happened in that regard. The Government is continually backing off from creating competitiveness within the sheltered sector and if the Government does not get its act together, we will pay dearly for that too.</P>
      <P>Much of what the Minister states is correct, but he is acting far too timidly and is not reforming the way his colleagues do business in the way necessary to achieve the results sought. The Bill would scarcely merit more than a poor pass if marked out of ten.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The publication yesterday of the report on tax shelters revealed in an extraordinary way the extent to which nine years of Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government have succeeded in creating an amazing two-tier tax structure for Irish society. The Labour Party has repeatedly demanded two principal changes to our tax structures to restore some sense of fairness. We propose the introduction of a minimum effective tax rate, such that even where incentives are retained, no one can avoid making a reasonable contribution. Alternatively, schemes could be capped. Our second proposal concerns the creation of a standing committee on taxation which would undertake an independent and costed review of all tax breaks as they arise. I am disappointed to hear the Minister specifically rule out the notion of ongoing review and cost-benefit analysis.</P>
      <P>Opposition spokespersons must play a game of blind man&rsquo;s bluff with the Minister as we try to second guess some of the arcane secrets of our annual Finance Bill. <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> has nothing on the mysteries of the annual Finance Bill. The only thing about which one can be sure is that every year for the past nine the small print of the Finance Bill has contained a secret bonanza for those who understand the Masonic rituals of tax avoidance for the super rich.</P>
      <P>This year, contrary to his promises to mend his ways, the Minister has included several hidden nuggets for Ireland&rsquo;s super rich. Many pensioners on modest incomes must have struggled yesterday to understand the case studies supplied by the Department of Finance which showed pension funds of &euro;100 million being built up for an individual, with a &euro;25 million tax free up-front payment, the balance to be invested in further attractive approved retirement funds with more tax breaks to come. Not only will the pensioner concerned receive a &euro;25 million tax-free payout on retirement but these schemes are arranged in such a way as for the benefits to be passed on to the spouse and children.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister uncharacteristically moaning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that people did not understand how necessary it had been to allow Ireland&rsquo;s tax structure to become a milch cow for the super wealthy. It must have been too early in <Col N="90"/>the morning for him. His extended appreciation of the super rich contrasts with the position of the young single person earning just over &euro;30,000 per annum who will pay income tax at a rate of 42% on any bonuses or overtime earnings he or she receives. That is the reality of tax equity in this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Administration: funds of &euro;100 million for the super wealthy and a tax rate of 42% on overtime payments for a young single worker.</P>
      <P>The Bill shows that the Minister is determined to brazen this out. Not alone has he been timid in applying sunset clauses to some of the most lucrative tax shelters such as hotels and car parks but he is determined to extend the principle of property based tax breaks to new areas of economic activity. The Bill will copperfasten the financial health of investors worth &euro;1 million who will be allowed a new set of tax breaks and conditions to develop private psychiatric hospitals and what the Bill describes as mental health centres.</P>
      <P>Section 34 extends the private hospital tax relief to private psychiatric hospitals and mental health centres. In addition, sections 35 to 37, inclusive, contain changes in the investment regime in private hospitals. Private psychiatric facilities will now qualify for tax breaks at the top rate of 42%. This will provide significant extra investment opportunities for very wealthy private investors wishing to take advantage of these reliefs. In sections 37 and 38 existing institutions such as nursing homes which qualify for tax breaks but are converted into another type of facility such as private psychiatric hospitals will receive roll-over relief and, therefore, continued tax breaks. We have recently heard of several unfortunate scandals involving nursing homes. However, nursing homes closed by the health authorities, thereby losing tax breaks, could, under the Bill, be turned into psychiatric or other health care institutions and carry valuable tax breaks in the special roll-over relief the Minister has introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been forthcoming on this issue before and I hope will be so again. Were these new reliefs the subject of specific representations to the Department of Finance? On Committee and Report Stages I will tease out why the Minister has undertaken to introduce such generous roll-over arrangements allowing cross-travel among care institutions in respect of valuable and lucrative tax breaks.</P>
      <P>The massive extension of tax breaks for private health care institutions is uncosted, contrary to the promises made by the Minister in his Budget Statement. Given that he is in an alliance with the Progressive Democrats, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children may call the shots on these issues in Government discussions. Nevertheless, the Minister promised to provide information and costings. If he proposes to limit property breaks for certain types of investment <Col N="91"/>such as hotels and car parks, he is opening up a new area of tax breaks. I agree with his eminent friend on the backbenches, Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe, who told me hospitals were the new hotels. As the Minister closes one door he opens another.</P>
      <P>Section 17 reflects the Minister&rsquo;s budget announcement that he would introduce a limit on the use of tax reliefs by certain high income individuals. It will apply to those with an income of over &euro;250,000 per annum, with tapered relief for those with an income of between &euro;250,000 and &euro;500,000 per annum. High income earners who pay no tax need not worry too much. The new rules will apply only from 1 January 2007 and any reliefs not claimed by virtue of the new rules can be used later. The relief will be spread over a longer period. The Minister is not capping the total amount. He is simply providing for roll-over relief. This is not an effective minimum tax rate.</P>
      <P>I now come to the sections of the Bill dealing with an extension of the rules in investing in private medical facilities, psychiatric hostels, nursing homes and so on. The individuals in question are of very high net worth and have very high incomes. When God or the Minister for Finance closes the door on one tax break, he never does so without opening another. The consultants&rsquo; report shows that, regarding private hospitals, &euro;500 million in tax breaks awaits projects already in the system in the short period during which they have been available. That is why a cost-benefit analysis is essential.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister should check this with his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats. It can involve a triple whammy against the State, the first being that, according to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, private hospitals and psychiatric institutions will receive public lands on which to build. Second, they will get the tax breaks that the Minister for Finance is so generously providing. For an investment of &euro;1 million a bed, they will receive &euro;420,000 in tax breaks. For a &euro;100 million private hospital of 100 beds, some &euro;42 million will come from the taxpayer. They will also be guaranteed business from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. We already have reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General showing that, while the NTPF has undoubtedly improved access to procedures for those who badly need hip replacements and so on, the cost has been extraordinarily high, since many of the procedures have been carried out by the same consultants in their private business in whose queues patients were waiting in public hospitals.</P>
      <P>We urgently need a serious, detailed breakdown of all the implications of the policy in the taxation feel good factor of the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s predecessor, former Deputy McCreevy. I knew the Minister well and he was a great man for betting on a horse or dog, as well as for a punt <Col N="92"/>on a tax break. A hunch told him that it would do the trick. I noticed that the Minister recently used the term &ldquo;health industry&rdquo;. The Government has abandoned the concept of health care as something we hope to provide for our people on the basis of need rather than the size of their wallets.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s review of tax relief concluded in his own words on budget day that &ldquo;any new reliefs should be time-limited and should, where relevant, be subject to an assessment of costs and benefits prior to their introduction&rdquo;. He said he would follow that advice as far as appropriate. Why, in his speech a few moments ago, has he denied us this and said he will not provide any public information on a cost-benefit analysis? Was it because the Progressive Democrats pulled the plug on greater transparency? It would be interesting to find out why the Minister has signalled such a change from what he announced with some confidence on budget day.</P>
      <P>All the Opposition parties in this House would join in appealing to the Minister to change the position he has just announced and publish the evaluations and cost-benefit analysis of the entire area of tax breaks for private medicine and the investors who are queueing up to put money in. The Minister for Health and Children advised me that she had met a representative of the Department of Finance and her own adviser on economics in separate meetings regarding the hospital in Blanchardstown in my constituency. I understand they took place in one of the Kildare Street clubs rather than in James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. According to her reply to my question, the Minister had had discussions with the consultants and, together with someone from the Department of Finance, prospective developers. We have since heard that developers are queueing up for this.</P>
      <P>The D&aacute;il in general and the Opposition, in particular, would be remiss unless they asked the Minister for Finance time and again to give us some information on costings. We know that projects worth &euro;500 million are in the pipeline, at a minimum cost to taxpayers of &euro;250 million. There may be an argument that there is a better way to improve health and we deserve to be able to make an assessment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the scheme to encourage low income SSIA-holders to invest in pensions, but one should not forget that pension fees are generally high, particularly in the early years. The Minister should clarify how he proposes to ensure the pensions industry does not appropriate that benefit, or a great deal of it, and rip off lower income SSIA-holders. His colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, knows well that one of the reasons the PRSA structure has fallen flat is that it is so costly for low income earners to enter that they perceive no benefit in doing so.</P><Col N="93"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill sets out the standard rate bands and increases for 2006. These expansions, although welcome, will still see approximately one third of taxpayers continue to pay income tax at the top rate of 42%. The Government promised that only 20% of taxpayers would pay at the top rate. The Bill confirms that after nine years in office, the Government remains as far away as ever from meeting its biggest promise to ordinary taxpayers. The challenge for the Minister is to introduce policies that support sustainable growth and employment in the economy, while ensuring a fair system of taxation.</P>
      <P>Despite record levels of growth, a series of recent reports, including from the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, are a damning indictment of our two-tier economy and tax system. I spoke on this issue at the time of the budget. Every year significant numbers of young men leave school with no qualifications to compete for minimum wage jobs or face a life on the dole. They are written off. We are allowing the potential of many young men in working class areas who attend schools where the drop-out rate is high to be wasted. It is an extraordinary indictment of nine years of the Government that yesterday the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, classified no fewer than 750 schools as disadvantaged. That may be a pre-election stroke to try to spread some extra resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a function of the resources provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>After nine years we have an enormous number of schools classified as disadvantaged. One must remember what disadvantage in education is ultimately about. Let us leave the teachers out of it and think of the children who attend a disadvantaged school, asking ourselves how many will secure good, well paid jobs and how many will go on to university. Particularly if they are boys, the answer is that many will drop out into dead-end jobs, a great waste of our people&rsquo;s potential.</P>
      <P>The Bill, contrary to the Minister&rsquo;s promises on budget day to introduce fairness, equity and a level playing pitch for all taxpayers, shows that it is business as usual for the Government. It would make a great deal of economic sense to wean the construction industry off unnecessary tax breaks, something the three reports show. However, so far the Minister has not found the courage to do so. I acknowledge the forces in the construction industry. Big developers are very powerful economically and have significant assets. Any flattening regarding the construction industry must be implemented on a graduated basis because we do not want a construction industry bubble that bursts and hurts the little people in economic terms.</P><Col N="94"/>
      <P>Section 13 deals with the allowance for child minders. During the passage of last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill, I recommended this kind of flexibility and I am happy that the Minister has adopted this proposal. However, the measure could be improved. I spoke on this during the debate on last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill to highlight the many women in the black economy who mind one to three children. They are not insured for pension or PRSI purposes and when they reach 65 or 66 years, are entirely dependent on their husbands to qualify for an old-age pension. It is important that either this Bill or the Social Welfare Bill brings those women in from the cold. Measures exist to enable them to regulate their situation and to be registered as child minders. The measures introduced by the Minister are simple and attractive but he needs to ensure the provision of a PRSI element to bring those women out of the black economy.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the sliding relief for the super-rich with regard to paying some minimum tax. The amount is &euro;250,000 and there is a sliding scale of relief for people on an income of between &euro;250,000 and &euro;500,000 but the limit is &euro;10,000 for the lady minding up to three children in her own home, not a penny more nor a penny less. A person earning &euro;10,500 is out. Why does the Minister not provide a sliding scale? There is a good argument to be made for avoiding a precipitative capping of reliefs both in social welfare and in taxation. However, why is the Minister&rsquo;s proposal so hard on the woman minding a couple of children or one child by decreeing that everything stops at &euro;10,000? I ask the Minister to consider a sliding scale of relief which would not be difficult to arrange and which would not cause the sky to fall in. This would make for a more flexible and more attractive uptake on the package.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of Gama. The Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, disclosed to me by way of a reply to a parliamentary question last year that Gama was obtaining hundreds of exemptions from PRSI certificates. It has been confirmed to me by the Revenue Commissioners that as a consequence, the company flew under the radar of the Revenue Commissioners. They did not know that the Gama workers were employed on a remittance basis. Once the company received the exemption from PRSI for their workers, they were then assigned to the remittance basis for taxation purposes.</P>
      <P>I do not know who worked out the Gama scheme but I suspect it was somebody very clever in a legal or accounting office somewhere in this town. I do not regard it as fair for the same legal and accounting offices to whinge that the Minister is having a look at the remittance basis. There have been scandals such as Gama and over-aggressive tax planning. If business advisers such as tax advisers, accountants and lawyers, <Col N="95"/>choose to exploit our system, then I support the Minister&rsquo;s attempts to ensure that we are not taken to the cleaners and that low-paid workers such as the Gama workers are not abused.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for the film industry. I refer to the principle of carrying out cost-benefit analysis reviews, pulling taxation into the light of day to see how it survives. The debates on the film industry which took place in the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service disclosed that the film industry is very valuable to this country. My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins was the person who really created it as we know it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It was Albert Reynolds actually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a valuable industry employing many people. It is a globally competitive industry which should be encouraged. The other side of the story was that, officials from the Revenue Commissioners and a few officials from the Minister&rsquo;s Department, clearly indicated abuses of the scheme. A public debate and public knowledge about incentives should lead us to examine the arguments for a proposal and also the abuses such as aggressive over-use which have been disclosed in the three reports.</P>
      <P>Many people are concerned about the lateness in the issuing of tax credit certificates and I ask the Minister to comment. This is causing problems. If the work situation changes for a husband and wife claiming as spouses, late amendments to tax credit certificates can produce a nasty shock for the person who may lose some of their tax credits. I have received many representations on this matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to those people who fail to collect tax refunds to which they are entitled, such as those for medical expenses and bin charges, I suggest, as I did last year, the establishment of a tax ombudsman &mdash; or woman &mdash; with the remit to take cases on behalf of the ordinary taxpayer to the Revenue Commissioners. This ombudsman could speak to the Revenue Commissioners on the issue of repayment of money to which the taxpayer is entitled. This office exists in the United States and in many European countries. It is high time such an office was established.</P>
      <P>The proof of the pudding will be in the eating regarding the arrangements made by the Minister for relevant contracts tax. I have raised the matter of significant tax evasion scams which are in operation in the construction industry and as a result the Revenue Commissioners have now agreed to focus audit attention on this matter. Any reform of relevant contracts tax must be thorough, particularly in the case of larger builders and public contracts where there is not a joined-up relationship between PRSI and taxation.</P><Col N="96"/>
      <P>At Christmas, the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, announced on RTE that something like 40% of people involved in claiming the lone-parent allowance were making a fraudulent claim because they were not living alone. A recent report detailed massive PRSI identity fraud, particularly because the computers at the Department of Social and Family Affairs are not geared to recognise non-Irish names. It is the job of the Government to ensure that everybody contributes a fair share but that equally, the country is not left open to identity fraud. This is a growing problem in the UK and much of it is organised by criminal gangs on a global basis. It is indicated that Ireland may be at risk.</P>
      <P>I welcome any measures to ensure that the construction industry and contractors are made more compliant and that the employment status of bona fide workers is recognised and honoured. It is early days to decide whether the measures the Minister is introducing will be successful.</P>
      <P>I have a couple of other queries to which the Minister may revert.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish on this point. As regards yesterday&rsquo;s report into the extraordinary largesse of the pension arrangements for higher income individuals, is the Minister proposing that the existing &euro;100 million schemes &mdash; the seven case studies in the report &mdash; should be capped or limited? Is the Minister trying to close the stable door after these particularly valuable horses have bolted?</P>

	<P>On budget day I remarked on the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s cautious approach to budgetary matters and I meant it as a compliment. It is always important for a person in his position to be prudent. However, the reverse side of the coin is that if one is of an overly conservative bent, one might be less inclined to recognise the need to bring about changes where inequity exists. Where the Minister has pushed out the boat in this Bill he has tended to do so in a half-hearted fashion. The effect of that may be to cause more damage in terms of social inequity. I hope that both on Second and Committee Stages the Minister will be more open to examining how even these cautious approaches towards reform <Col N="97"/>might be further improved because they are necessary.</P>
      <P>Today&rsquo;s debate has been framed by the Government&rsquo;s release of the reports on the review of tax reliefs. The Minister had those reports at his disposal in October 2005 and they helped to inform him in the preparation of the budget. It is unfortunate that Opposition spokespersons and other Members of the House have only gained access to this stage of the review process today, as we begin debating the Finance Bill. The Bill is a fairly weighty document in itself but the fact that three other documents of doorstep dimensions have been added to it hardly helps our preparations in making sure that everything is examined in its proper context.</P>
      <P>The documents reveal facts concerning how tax reliefs have been applied and how their effects will continue to be felt in future. This does no credit to the Government or to the idea of using tax reliefs properly. Even though the reports released yesterday contain useful information, which is necessary to this debate, their terms of reference were wrong. I would like the consultants to have asked why each and every one of these reliefs was introduced, by whom, who influenced the process and how they were introduced at the time? If we had the answers to those questions we could see how arbitrary the introduction of many of these tax reliefs has been. It may be anecdotal but it has never been denied that many of these reliefs were introduced the day before a budget speech was delivered to the House. If that is the way in which taxpayers have ended up paying so many billions of the country&rsquo;s reserves, the practice must be ended once and for all.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he is willing to examine the question of time limits as well as discussing cost-benefit analyses but it will be a matter of debate as to how he goes about doing so. In the interim, the Minister has chosen to extend some of the more contentious schemes and introduce new tax reliefs seemingly without the benefit of such a cost benefit analysis. If that is the way the Government and the Minister intends to proceed, the interests of taxpayers will not be properly served. This is particularly true of the property reliefs, which have been mentioned by other speakers. Not only do we have to account for massive over-expenditure with seemingly little benefit in cost terms but a ratio of two to one is a high price for the country to pay for many such reliefs. The decisions made by the Minister and his predecessor will have a long and swollen tail. As revenues and tax liability increase, so will the amount of tax foregone by the State.</P>
      <P>I was struck by one figure in the Goodbody report. It showed that the extension of property reliefs from 2004 to mid-2006 will cost taxpayers &euro;1.3 billion. I do not think the Minister is being entirely honest in this debate because on his own <Col N="98"/>watch we have seen this type of expenditure going out of control. The Minister states that he can further control such expenditure by extending time periods and increasing benefits to particular people in society but it begs further questions as to why the reliefs were introduced in the first place and why they are being extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <?oasys _cl11- ?>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the recommendation of the consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I found the consultants&rsquo; reports curious in many ways and, as I said earlier, I think the terms of reference had a great deal to do with that. I find it hard to square the analysis and the recommendations of the consultants&rsquo; reports with the facts they presented in the course of the reports. If they are saying, as Indecon has said in its executive summary, that tax reliefs are a highly costly and wasteful form of achieving policy goals, I find some of their recommendations inconsistent in the extreme.</P>
      <P>It is fairly convenient that the expiry date for these reliefs, as with the introduction of tax liability for stud fees on stallions and greyhounds, will be after the next general election. If the Minister wants his legacy to include bringing about change and equity, these changes should be introduced now. If the Government was really interested in making up lost ground on this issue, the changes should have been introduced several years ago.</P>
      <P>The measures the Minister is introducing in this Finance Bill are the rabbits in the hat that we do not get to learn about on budget day. The Minister is showing too tentative an approach, particularly on the proposals concerning SSIA holders and pensions. The Minister should be acknowledged as having tried to put in place some mechanism to encourage further saving and many Members of the House would approve of that. The difficulty is, however, that the thresholds he set for being within the 20% band and the income limit exclude far too many people who could and should benefit from such a move. The Government seems to be in a heap over what exactly its pensions policy is. We have a national pensions fund which seems likely to cover only the public sector pensions bill when it comes to fruition. There is massive inequity as regards how existing tax reliefs are being used and who benefits from private pensions. Those inequities will increase because of the proposals the Minister is making in this Bill. However, the Government seems to adopt an almost timid approach to what the basic State pension should be in ten, 15, 20 or 25 years&rsquo; time. The benchmark we should set for our pension policies is a guaranteed standard of living for all citizens when they retire. They may no longer contribute economically to the manufacturing or services sectors but they will still be consumers.</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5">I wish to share time with Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, Stanton and Deenihan.</P>
      <P>The food and drink sector in Ireland accounts for almost half of the output value and for 29% of employment of indigenous Irish industry. One in every 11 people in the workforce is employed in the industry. More than 700 food companies provide direct employment to more than 40,000 <Col N="100"/>people, while indirectly supporting 180,000 jobs in supply and ancillary services. The industry also has a unique importance in terms of the national spatial strategy as significant volumes of food processing take place in every county.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
      <P>If we were to strategically develop Irish farming and food processing to become more commercial, more consumer orientated and more competitive on the global markets, we could secure a prosperous future for Irish farmers as the main supplier to this industry, which would aid the overall growth of the Irish economy. Sadly, the Government has failed to recognise this fact. This day last week in the House, when the Taoiseach was questioned by our party leader, Deputy Kenny, on the nitrates directive, he replied the position obtained following long negotiations was satisfactory, and this has been explained to Irish farm leaders and in Europe. Sadly, the Government has lost the plot regarding the nitrates directive.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the issue in April last year, the Minister for Agriculture and Food said the problems had been exaggerated by Fine Gael because there are many farmers along the west coast and across the State who would not feel the impact at all. This clearly shows the Minister underestimated the implications of the nitrates action plan. The core objective behind the plan should have been to ensure the voluntary code of good farming practice, published in 1996 by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Ivan Yates, was converted into legal obligations on the farming community. This would have ensured good quality of water and would have protected our environment. However, the goal posts have moved.</P>
      <P>The Government claims the nitrates directive is being forced on it by the European Union. However, the nitrates directive position in Ireland is at variance with that in other EU states. There is no closed period for the spreading of farmyard manure in Northern Ireland, where poultry litter can also be stored on land during the winter. In the Republic we have a closed period from November to January and outside of this farmers must use a thermometer because unless the ground temperatures reach 6&deg; Celsius outside the closed period, they cannot spread slurry. Along with forks and wellies, farmers must now have calendars and thermometers as basic tools of their profession.</P>
      <P>Irish phosphorus regulations are completely out of line with what has happened in the rest of Europe. No other country is banning phosphorus use on all land which tests at over ten parts per million. The Irish phosphorus regulations are now by far the strictest in Europe. In most countries, the phosphates issue has not yet been discussed with the European Union. Northern Ireland farmers have been given until 2015 to implement individual farm phosphorus limits, as have Dutch farmers. The nitrogen and phosphorus limits come on top of other rules with regard to soiled water, and there is huge complexity involved <Col N="101"/>regarding the storage of such water for a minimum of ten days. The implications and cost of that, especially for small producers with fragmented farms, have not been fully considered.</P>
      <P>Last February, the Minister for Agriculture and Food told this house that the introduction of the single farm payment would lead to a significant reduction in the level of bureaucracy both for farmers and her Department. The implications of the nitrates directive show this is grossly misleading. To further compound the problem, as far back as April 2002, in the Fianna F&aacute;il submission to the IFA on general election issues, the party stated that where an action programme is introduced under the nitrates directive it would be on a scientific approach and include adequate time for phased compliance by farmers. One week after the implementation of the nitrates action plan, no information has yet been provided to farmers on how to comply with the bureaucracy set out under the plan. This highlights the double standards of this Government. The nitrates action plan has a direct impact on day-to-day farm practices and farmers are liable to a six-month jail term for non-compliance.</P>
      <P>A major public information campaign is to be introduced regarding the introduction of penalty point offences, in order to address the carnage on our roads. Those responsible for killing and injuring people on our roads will thus get a major public awareness campaign to let them know they may be liable to two penalty points. Farmers, however, who must deal with reams of paperwork on feed and fertilisers, are liable to up to six months in jail for non-compliance with the nitrates action plan, yet have not been given one sheet of paper on how to comply.</P>
      <P>Even the Government statement last week on the suspension of part of the nitrates action plan is full of riddles. There is no indication that the Government will review the nitrates tables, especially those from 12 to 21, which are of critical importance with regard to good farming practice in this country. Those tables need to be amended to comply with Teagasc best farming management practice rather than with the current rules and regulations.</P>
      <P>Last July, the Minister announced details of farm waste management grants. We still have not seen those grants in place and we do not know the specification regarding earthen banks, for example, which farmers require for planning permission. The Minister advised farmers in July that they should apply for planning permission. It is very hard to do that when, six months later, the specifications have still not been issued by the Department of Agriculture and Food. The Minister has still not discussed the issue with the Commission and resolved the difficulties and we have no indication on a possible derogation for Ireland. When Deputy Crawford and I met the Commission last April, the indication was that a derogation would take 12 months from the date of application, if Ireland was lucky enough to <Col N="102"/>receive one. The Commission also warned us on that occasion that it was critically important that Ireland would put the storage requirements in place which would facilitate a positive decision on derogation. Nothing has happened in that regard. Sadly, the Minister has taken a back seat and washed her hands of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Far from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Agriculture and Food has been fully conscious of the implications of the nitrates action plan but for some unknown reason that has not been communicated to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. That was publicly admitted before Christmas at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. Sadly, the Minister has not taken action. It is about time she started taking an active role on the issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also failed on the sugar issue. She failed to make the case at EU level for the survival of the Irish sugar industry. First, she failed to ensure the retention of the Carlow sugar plant until the negotiations were complete, which could have strengthened her hand in those negotiations. Instead she turned her back on the Carlow plant and the people of Carlow. She also failed to impress on the Commission that Ireland was in a unique position in that it had only one processing factory and was not contributing to the over-production of sugar within the EU, and that restructuring was naturally taking place in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A key question which the Minister failed to have answered by the Commission was whether a member state should have the right to produce sugar, and whether Ireland had that right. Even after the negotiations nobody seems to know what exactly was agreed. Does the Minister know what she signed up to and at what cost to Irish farmers? There are currently 3,700 farmers who grow sugar beet and who are in limbo on a number of fronts. What was the specific detail of the Minister&rsquo;s agreement when she signed up to facilitate the closure of the Irish sugar industry? What will be the reference year or years on which compensation will be based? Will farmers be forced to grow beet at a loss in 2006? Under what circumstances must the restructuring levy be paid if there is sugar production in 2006 or 2007?</P>
      <P>The Minister claims that there is no liability but the European Commission stated in a response to my colleague, Mairead McGuinness, MEP, that Ireland would be liable for the levy in both 2006 and 2007 if we were to produce sugar in both years. Who will be paid compensation, under what circumstances and at what level? Under the restructuring fund of &euro;145 million, is it the case that growers and contractors are entitled to a maximum of 10% or at least 10%? That is a key question. What about the 1,000 or so people employed in the sugar beet processing industry and ancillary activities?</P><Col N="103"/>
      <P>Farmers must decide whether to grow sugar beet this year. They must make arrangements about matters such as conacre, fertiliser, seed and getting land ready. Despite a week of negotiations last November, no one, including the Minister, seems to know or have answers in respect of what was agreed. We are now told that we must wait for the legal text before we know what is happening.</P>
      <P>We know there is compensation in respect of the price reduction and a once-off payment of &euro;4 million in the event of sugar beet production ceasing in this country. What about the &euro;145 million compensation available for the economic, social and environmental costs of the restructuring of the Irish sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota? Last week, the Minister of State stated that &ldquo;at least 10% of the fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery&rdquo;. However, no mention was made of farmers who purchased sugar quota.</P>
      <P>This is a mess and the Minister does not seem to know exactly what is happening. She cannot provide answers on the matter. I call on her to immediately instigate multi-party talks on the future of the sugar industry and the scale of the compensation to be made available to beet growers and contractors. The forum must be composed of representatives of growers, contractors, Greencore, the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the employees of the company and the Attorney General to deal with all the complex issues raised by the reform of the sugar industry.</P>
      <P>We need immediate clarification on the production of sugar in 2006 and legal clarity on the ownership of the sugar quota and the powers of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who holds a golden share in Irish Sugar. While the Minister has stated that the quota is not an asset, that is not true. Many farmers have traded quota in the past and now the EU is going to buy back quota from member states. This clearly indicates that the EU believes that the quota is an asset. If that is so, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Attorney General must provide clarity on the ownership and the powers the Minister has under her golden share.</P>
      <P>We must know what plans, if any, the Government has to kick-start the bio-fuel sector, which could be a valuable outlet for sugar beet. Sugar beet is one of the best raw materials for the production of ethanol. However, as matters stand, it is not economical without excise reduction or removal. The Government could be doing more to look beyond mere sugar production to harnessing sugar beet growth for bio-energy.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has published a set of proposals on this topic, including the removal of all excise duties on bio-fuels produced from all renewable <Col N="104"/>energy crops and funds for the establishment and operation of a number of bio-fuel processing plants. Fine Gael also proposes to legislate for all motor fuels to include a blend of fuel from renewable sources. All petrol sold at filling stations will include a 5% bio-ethanol mix and all diesels will contain a 2% bio-diesel mix. This would not necessitate the conversion of standard motor engines and would represent a good start to reducing emissions from cars. It would provide an immediate market for farmers to sell energy crops.</P>
      <P>If the existing plant in Mallow were used to produce bio-ethanol from beet, it would dramatically reduce the Greencore case for compensation as it would not need to foot the cost of job losses or decommissioning the plant to return it to a greenfield site. Furthermore, under no circumstances can Greencore be compensated for the closure of the Carlow plant, a decision that seriously undermined the Irish negotiating position and that the company stated at the time stood up to commercial scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister held discussions with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the issue of utilising the sugar beet crop or is it like her consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the nitrates directive? Each time I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food about the nitrates directive, her first comment was that it was an issue for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Good boy, the Deputy must be learning. If he repeats it long enough, he might understand it. That is his answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that she took a back seat in respect of the nitrates directive and did not lay out the implications of its implementation as it stood for Irish farmers. She has not played an active role with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government towards developing a comprehensive bio-fuel industry. She made an announcement today regarding a three year research programme but it should not have been up to her to do so. Her colleague, the previous Minister for Agriculture and Food, should have done it a long time ago. It is a bit late trying to close the door after the horse has bolted.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s failure to close off various legal loopholes in the area of food labelling is undermining confidence in the Irish meat industry. Irish farmers are obliged to compete with low cost products that should be clearly labelled. Meat derived from low standards throughout the world and with low cost production is entering the European Union and competing on a level playing pitch with Irish products, whether as beef, poultry, lamb or whatever. It is critically important that we at least play on a level pitch. Pork from the United States of America, chicken <Col N="105"/>from south east Asia, lamb from Thailand, beef from Brazil and vegetables from Israel are coming into this country and being passed off on restaurant tables as Irish food or reprocessed here and sent out as Irish products.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
      <P>This causes significant problems, one of which is with consumer confidence. Irish consumers are shopping blindfolded in our supermarkets because they are unable to decipher our ambiguous labelling system. It is disgraceful that we can bring a chicken fillet from Asia into this country, spread breadcrumbs on it and call it an Irish chicken fillet. Something is wrong with that system.</P>
      <P>The prepared consumer food sector is one of our greatest success stories, as the Minister has acknowledged, with annual sales reaching &euro;3 billion. Exports in 2004 were valued at &euro;1.6 billion. What happens if a product that does not meet our basic standards is imported from a third country, reprocessed into a consumer product and sent out of this country with an Irish label? It would have a devastating impact on the Irish processing industry and on Ireland, but it is allowed to happen week in, week out.</P>
      <P>The Minister promised labelling within the catering trade and at long last, the legislation is going through the House. Last September, the Minister announced a voluntary code but I have not yet seen any restaurants that have implemented it.</P>

	<P>I have not yet seen country of origin labelling placed on food.</P>
      <P>A chicken fillet on the Irish market at present is named after an island off the County Mayo coast and its package is green, white and orange. It is processed in Germany but I would lay any money that the product comes from outside the European Union. That is a deception of consumers here and throughout the European Union. Sadly, nothing has happened in the Minister&rsquo;s Department to address the matter. The abuse is continuing. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised the nitrates directive, as currently framed, will cause the worst crisis in rural Ireland since the economic war. I refer to the Government regulations giving effect to Directive No. 788 of 2005, a complex 47 page document. There will be major adverse effects on agriculture throughout the country as <Col N="106"/>a consequence of these regulations, and particularly in my constituency of Cork South-West. The consequences will be calamitous and there will be an appalling impact on all sectors of our rural community and those dependent on them.</P>
      <P>Many kinds of farming and farm-related activities take place in Cork South-West and this has caused me to speak in this debate. We have the best dairy farmers in the country, farming based on growing and grazing grass in an environmentally friendly manner for up to 330 days per year. Currently we have a competitive cost advantage but under the directive this advantage will be severely affected if not totally eliminated. We also have many less intensive farmers and in the earlier debates on the nitrates directive it was believed these would not be affected. It is now clear they will be affected and many will have their viability questioned.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many involved in the pigs and poultry sector recently. Their view is that they will be wiped out and I am not sure what is the Minister&rsquo;s reaction. Serious people involved in serious business foresee a wipeout. This is a major problem, affecting an area that has 10,000 sows.</P>
      <P>I refer to four major co-ops, including Carbery, in my area. The workers in those co-ops will be affected and towns and villages dependent on agriculture and the food sector will be severely affected. I do not think the interests of these people are being properly addressed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food. I do not mean this in a personal sense as, on a personal level, I like the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my death knell. The Chair will be jealous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The interests of rural Ireland have not been looked after by the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Her statement in April of last year, suggesting Fine Gael was exaggerating the problem, defies criticism given the current outcome. This position was reiterated by the Taoiseach last week, who seemed to dismiss the difficulties, in response to Deputy Kenny. The Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food have sleepwalked rural Ireland into a catastrophe. Many farmers have been placed in an untenable position and many are now breaking the law without being aware of it.</P>
      <P>The past is past and the damage has been done. What can be done to rescue rural Ireland? Regulation No. 788 of 2005 should be withdrawn in its entirety. Regulation is necessary as has been clearly outlined by Deputy Naughten, who has highlighted this issue for the past 18 months. Any revised document should take into account the realities outlined by Fine Gael. It should also be based on scientific data and an objective assessment of water quality in Ireland. We seek a framework that can be implemented without <Col N="107"/>threatening farming and farm related operations. This requires a reasoned public debate focussing on the objectives to be achieved. Despite the improvements in water quality objectives must be achieved but we must focus on major concerns that arise.</P>
      <P>We must receive a decent derogation and the figure of 250 kilogrammes is generally accepted. Besides the figure, we must consider conditions that may be attached to the regulations. In the world of single farm payments there is no point in having complicated conditions, endless bureaucracy and high cost in compliance. The derogation should be practical and long-term as there is no point in a one or two year derogation.</P>
      <P>I am not certain how many have studied this entire document but I have studied it with experts in the field. Tables 12 and 13 are a disaster and should be withdrawn. These are economic guidelines from Teagasc set as legal maxima but we want best practice advice from Teagasc for each farmer.</P>
      <P>Confusion exists in respect of grants. Decent grants, perhaps 70%, should be made available for a reasonable length of time but there is no point in having a scheme such as this if the grants cannot be drawn down. Sufficient time should be provided so that farmers can comply and provide storage space. The confusion that exists, with a law that farmers do not understand, must end and we seek proper public consultation and guideline documents for farmers. Farmers, advisors, inspectors, county council members and Deputies do not know what is happening. The information deficit is enormous.</P>
      <P>We must examine the problems of less intensive farmers and the possibility for industries such as pigs and poultry. What has the Minister done regarding advances in technology? Last week a contract was signed between UCC and Moor Park on technology and this reflects the Government&rsquo;s position. A contract was signed last week concerning a regulation that came into effect on 1 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The nitrates directive will have major implications for north Kerry, especially in the Feale catchment area, the most intensive dairy and farming part of the country. It will have major implications for the pig and poultry industries in the area.</P>
      <P>I refer to the food labelling element of this motion. Food labelling is consumers&rsquo; first point of contact with Irish food and they must be assured that products branded Irish are Irish. The same applies to overseas markets, where many customers chose Irish produce over any other product. There is no room for uncertainty or complacency.</P>
      <P>CSO figures show that beef imports increased by a staggering 60% to almost 30,000 tonnes, representing a third of the entire domestic require<Col N="108"/>ment. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has continued to stall on implementing a labelling requirement for the catering sector. Current EU legislation allows any meat product imported from outside the EU to be labelled as an EU product provided it has undergone a substantial transformation. Currently, beef from Brazil, lamb from New Zealand, chicken from Thailand, pork from the United States and vegetables from Israel are being passed off as Irish. Irish labelling laws have failed to make this practice illegal.</P>
      <P>Irish agriculture and food is facing tremendous pressure from imports, price cuts arising from world trade talks and the impact of the global marketplace. We have a quality product, with a good international reputation, which could be severely undermined if we do not protect it with watertight labelling laws. The Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Health and Children lack the willpower to end current labelling loopholes. Many firms are reprocessing meats such as chicken and pork from third countries and selling these on as Irish or failing to point out that the meats are non-Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Chicken and pork, let us get serious. We need some national spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This continues to be a significant problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should have a bit of courage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to hear Deputy Smith. I am glad he has a view on something at last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Feet on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This continues to be a significant problem, particularly regarding the meat sold by the catering industry. Current EU regulations allow for meat, which has undergone what it terms substantial transformation, to be imported into the EU from third countries, processed and passed off as Irish produce.</P>
      <P>There are many problems with current meat labelling requirements. According to EU beef labelling regulations, beef imported into Ireland from a non-EU country which does not meet all the requirements set out can still be sold if it is labelled as non-EU. It is merely an indication as to where slaughter took place. This is far from ideal. It does not give enough guarantees to consumers, particularly as there are numerous food scares in many EU states.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there is an extensive foot and mouth outbreak in Brazil. If third country meat is slaughtered or processed in some manner, such as pork to sausages or the addition of breadcrumbs, the processor can label the product as Irish. This does not represent the true origins of the meat. What we state clearly is that we want to know what people eat. We want to know the <Col N="109"/>truth and it should be labelled as such. Deputy Smith should pay attention now that he interrupted me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Deenihan is strong on the ditch he is on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister expressed her support for regulations at EU level that beef served in catering restaurants should have the country of origin on the menu. This must be extended to all meat types, including chicken, pork and lamb. This provision will be meaningless unless Irish consumers can be guaranteed that what they are eating is Irish or from another country. Current labelling requirements do not guarantee this.</P>
      <P>We were promised that labelling provision of the country of origin on restaurant menus would be introduced. That is still not compulsory throughout the State. To protect Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for producing top quality and safe food, the Minister for Agriculture and Food must take urgent action. Ireland must protect its quality domestic product by distinctively labelling its own produce. It is vitally important. I am aware the Minister&rsquo;s officials are examining this and they must come forward with proposals as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>On the issue of traceability, in October 2004, the EU food and veterinary office identified serious deficiencies within the Brazilian beef processing industry, particularly regarding its traceability and tagging system. However, we continue to import beef which does not meet the high standards required of Irish beef. Following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Brazil in October 2005, the EU moved to ban the importation of beef from certain regions of Brazil. Given that Brazil&rsquo;s tracing systems have been found to be flawed in the past, this ban should be applied nationally.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has put forward a good proposal. Ireland, with its green image, low population density, extensive farm production system and reputation for quality food production, lies on the edge on one of the richest markets in the world and is ideally placed to capitalise on the opportunities to supply this emerging food market. Fine Gael proposes that a green Ireland label should be developed by Bord Bia and marketed throughout the world. The label would seek to build on Ireland&rsquo;s green image and capacity to produce safe quality assured food, which lives up to its reputation. Deputy Naughten will outline the proposal. The bottom line is that we must protect Irish food and we are failing to do so. I am sure Deputy Smith is interested in doing the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss the important issue of the future &mdash; or lack of a future &mdash; of the sugar industry. Our motion calls for the Government to provide clarity, particularly on the implementation of the <Col N="110"/>restructuring levy and the distribution of the compensation package for Irish Sugar.</P>
      <P>What is the position with regard to the &euro;25 million levy? Does the Minister know whether it must be paid this year? I challenge the Minister this evening to answer that question. It is crucial that we know. There seems to be a contradiction. I raised this matter last week on the Adjournment with the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, but he was unable to answer the question I put to him regarding the levy. He did not even refer to it in his response.</P>
      <P>If sugar beet is grown this year, must the levy be paid? The European Commission stated in Brussels to my colleague, Deputy Mairead McGuinness, MEP, that it does, but the Minister is reported to have stated it does not. There is clearly a contradiction. I want the Minister to tell us tonight what is the position on whether it must be paid. It is important that farmers and the industry know. We need clarity on that point.</P>
      <P>Prior to coming here this evening, I spoke to a worker in the sugar plant in Mallow, the last of four. He pointed out that the plant is one of the most efficient in operation, that the sugar company was rationalised during the past 12 months to compete in Europe and that the campaign for this year is now finished. He wanted to know whether it was the last campaign. What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on that? It is crucial that we know.</P>
      <P>There were 72,000 acres and 185,000 tonnes of sugar involved and the campaign was completed last Sunday night, which is a record as far as I know. The workers in the plant need to know their future prospects. Approximately 1,000 people apart from farmers are dependent on it. We saw reports of people supplying machinery, hauliers, contractors and workers in the plant. Their future is at stake. It is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility to state what the future will be, whether it is possible even at this 11th hour to keep the sugar industry going in Ireland or to convert the plant into one which produces ethanol to keep jobs. Does the Government have a view on that?</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the IFA recently commissioned Deloitte &amp; Touche to carry out a report. It maintains that even with single payments and diversification payments, the farming community is set to lose &euro;106 million during the coming years due to the lack of the sugar beet crop. Until this year sugar beet was probably the most profitable crop grown by farmers. It was a sure crop and was important for rotation purposes. The loss in my part of the country in particular will be immense. I emphasise to the Minister tonight how serious this issue is, how seriously farmers are taking it and how uncertain they feel.</P>
      <P>During the past couple of days we had exceptionally fine weather for this time of year. Farmers were out tilling the land, preparing for con<Col N="111"/>acre and buying fertiliser. However, they do not know whether they will grow sugar beet this year. Greencore issued a letter on 27 January indicating that because of the uncertainty regarding the levy and the quota, it was not sure whether it could take the risk of going ahead with the campaign this year.</P>
      <P>The clock is ticking. It is gone beyond the 11th hour and the Minister for Agriculture and Food must bring clarity to the situation. Tonight we have given her the opportunity to do so. I call on her and challenge her to come forward with clear information regarding what exactly is going on in this industry. In his response last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, stated it is up to the company and the farmers to come together and sort it out. I call on the Minister to provide leadership, examine the motion we tabled and establish a forum to bring together all the interested parties to see whether an agreement can be reached on the future of the sector. That is crucial.</P>
      <P>In my part of the country, people are in despair because of the uncertainty. They do not know whether they can grow beet this year. Will the plant be returned to a totally greenfield site if beet production ceases? I challenge the Minister to bring clarity to the debate and to give clear answers. If she does not know the answers to questions, she should say so.</P>

      <P FLI="0">Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis na Teachta&iacute; Carty agus Johnny Brady.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to address issues arising for the agriculture and agrifood sector. The Irish agrifood sector is the most important and successful indigenous economic sector in this country. It is facing major change and challenge arising from a combination of factors, notably developments in EU and world trade agriculture policy, technological developments, changes in food markets and increasing trade liberalisation.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the CAP has been fundamentally reformed and is now based firmly on the principles of sustainability and market orientation. The Irish agricultural sector showed its readiness to fully embrace the opportunities of the reformed CAP by opting for the full decoupling of direct payments.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office as Minister for Agriculture and Food, one of my top priorities was to ensure the implementation of the decoupled single payment scheme, the most significant change to agricultural support since our accession to the European Community.</P>
      <P>This huge task was successfully implemented when over &euro;1 billion in single payments issued to 118,500 farmers last December meeting the target we had set ourselves of making the payments on the first possible date. By any standards, this was a major undertaking and the outcome, after painstaking preparatory work in establishing individual entitlements, was a major achievement.</P>
      <P>Currently, total payments amount to &euro;1,114 million with 95% of farmers paid. A number of payment runs continue to be made weekly as the more complicated files are cleared. I should add that the changeover to the single payment was undertaken while work continued on winding up <Col N="113"/>existing schemes. This was but one achievement in a year marked by many.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the negotiations on the financial perspectives was very significant in terms of the preservation of the CAP in the face of a number of powerful member states whose priorities lay elsewhere. At the December European Council, political agreement was reached on the financial perspectives for the 2007 to 2013 period. Key objectives for Ireland were the provision of adequate funding for CAP direct payments, market supports and rural development. This was achieved.</P>
      <P>Over the seven years 2007 to 2013, Ireland will receive over &euro;9.1 billion in CAP direct payments. Additional spending on market supports should put this figure well over &euro;1 0.3 billion. We also secured a good outcome on EU support for rural development. We will receive an allocation of EU rural development funds on the same basis as the other EU 15 member states but we will also receive a special additional allocation of &euro;500 million. The precise details remain to be finalised but I expect that our receipts under rural development should be in the region of &euro;1.9 billion.</P>
      <P>We also wanted to ensure that any deal reached would remain intact for the full seven years until 2013. While the December agreement includes a review clause under which the Commission will report in 2008-09 on both the expenditure and revenue sides of the budget, unanimity will be required for any decisions taken under this review. As far as I am concerned, the review process will not in any way prejudice the funding for CAP up to 2013. We can now plan for the future with the confidence that direct payments under the CAP are secure up to 2013 and that the EU will continue to be a strong supporter of rural development.</P>
      <P>Earlier in 2005, agreement was reached on a new EU rural development package for the 2007 to 2013 period. This provides an excellent support framework and was particularly satisfactory in so far as forestry support and the classification of disadvantaged areas was concerned. We are now proceeding to draw up a national strategy and rural development programmes in consultation with the stakeholders.</P>
      <P>In the ongoing negotiations on the WTO development round, we resisted pressure in the Hong Kong ministerial meeting to agree to 2010 as the end date for export refunds. A more satisfactory outcome was achieved providing for conditional agreement on the end of 2013 for elimination of all forms of export subsidies &mdash; not only refunds but also export subsidies used by non-EU countries. This gives the industry in Ireland eight years to adjust and ensures there will be a level playing field with our competitors on world markets. We also ensured that the flexibility on how to phase out export subsidies has been retained by the EU which is very important for Ireland.</P><Col N="114"/>
      <P>In addition to these over-arching achievements the Government&rsquo;s proactive approached to the sector was demonstrated throughout the year in a number of areas. We negotiated a major package to deal with the overshoot of the special beef premium ceiling. The package included funding of &euro;17.5 million benefiting some 25,000 farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>They are still looking for the rest of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We achieved the highest level of participation in REPS with a record level of 48,000 farmers receiving nearly &euro;283 million in payments in 2005. This is the highest figure since REPS began in 1994 and represents an increase of 36% on the previous year.</P>
      <P>A generous package of measures was provided for farmers in the 2006 budget. Farm-specific measures worth over &euro;24 million will help meet the challenges ahead in relation to competing on global markets. The main focus of these budget measures is to help farmers consolidate farm holdings through leasing or purchase of land, to further the productive use of land and to encourage the entry of young farmers into agriculture.</P>
      <P>The gross Estimate for my Department for 2006 will exceed &euro;1.516 billion, an increase of 12% on last year&rsquo;s outturn of &euro;1.355 billion. Generous funding is provided for a whole range of schemes designed to put money directly into farmers&rsquo; pockets and to assist them in adjusting to the requirements of the reformed CAP. Increased funding was provided for REPS, the early retirement scheme, installation aid, on-farm investment schemes, disadvantaged areas incomes support and forestry.</P>
      <P>This massive financial support is hardly the hallmark of a Minister or an administration whose commitment to the farm sector can be questioned. The upshot of the support provided in 2005 combined with good market conditions for principal sectors resulted in an increase of almost 20% in farm incomes, hardly indicative of a sector in crisis. There was progress on many other fronts, including the animal health area and in food safety but I wish to turn to the specific issues raised by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The nitrates directive has been there since 1991. Sooner or later it had to be complied with. We are coming to the end of long and difficult negotiations with the Commission in which both the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and I have fought hard to get the best outcome for Ireland and Irish agriculture. In spite of all the exaggeration, scare-mongering and general grandstanding that have gone on in the past few weeks, I believe we have succeeded.</P>
      <P>We must all face certain realities, however tempting it might be to pretend they do not exist. The nitrates directive is European law and is not optional. The basic provisions of the directive <Col N="115"/>have been clarified by the European Court of Justice in a series of cases that the Commission brought against several member states, including Ireland. The court has found that Ireland had not implemented the directive. When the court finds that a member state has not implemented European law, only two things can happen. Either the member state comes into line or the Commission returns to the court and asks it to impose a fine. In this case, our advice is that a fine would be in the region of &euro;11 million a year, back-dated for several years. No Government could risk taxpayers&rsquo; money in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>What about electronic voting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The court judgment and the threat of a fine were not the only things to be taken into consideration. Most Irish farmers depend on EU payments for their viability. When the current round of rural development measures was approved in 2000, the Commission insisted on an undertaking to implement the nitrates directive. The current round runs to the end of this year. It was made very clear to us that continued EU funding for the duration of the round was contingent on some movement on our part on nitrates.</P>
      <P>The next rural development period starts in January 2007 and will run to 2013. Within months, we will enter discussions with the Commission on our proposals for the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, compensatory allowances, forestry, on-farm investment and the Leader programme for the next seven years. We must be in a position to launch all these new schemes in January. Without agreement on nitrates, there is no prospect of getting Commission approval in time. Moreover, the introduction of the single payment scheme marks the most important change to the system of direct payments in many years and is vital to the vast majority of farmers. Every cent of it comes from Brussels and without agreement on nitrates it would also have been at risk.</P>
      <P>These considerations tend to be overlooked in some quarters when the nitrates directive is mentioned. It is hard to tell whether this is deliberate. Others lightly wave aside the threat to EU funding, as though it is a transparent bluff by Brussels. Such issues should not be disregarded during the debate this evening and tomorrow. The nitrates directive, with the regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, cannot be discussed in isolation. They are part of a much bigger picture and the idea that we could stonewall the Commission, as if rural development funding, the single payment scheme and daily fines were completely unrelated matters, is nonsensical.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the implementation of the regulations will be challenging for some farmers. <Col N="116"/>The Government is committed to helping the farming community meet the challenge by providing information as well as improved financial assistance and tax reliefs, which are already in place. Following from commitments made in the Sustaining Progress agreement, which related explicitly to the nitrates directive, the Department negotiated average increases in REPS payments of 28%. The REP scheme is now hailed on all sides as a success, with numbers and spending reaching record levels last year. We also introduced improvements to the farm waste management scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme.</P>
      <P>I have tabled proposals to the Commission for further major improvements to the farm waste management scheme which will provide a far more attractive package to farmers than that which was previously available. The proposed changes include the introduction of a standard grant rate of up to 70%, instead of the present 40%, for both animal housing and slurry storage. The scheme will be extended for the first time to the pig and poultry sectors. There will be an increase in the income ceiling for farmers from 450 to 650 income units, with no upper limit being applied in the case of pig and poultry farmers. Moreover, the maximum eligible investment will go up from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding. I also seek the removal of any minimum income requirement from farming from the scheme so that all small farmers can participate in it.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the improved scheme are at an advanced stage and I have recently written to Commissioner Fischer Boel, stressing the major importance of this issue for Ireland. I expect that any remaining issues will be resolved shortly and that the revised scheme will be introduced at an early date. I have secured an Estimates provision of &euro;43 million in 2006 for the revised scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to an improved farm waste management scheme, I have also sought EU approval for the introduction of a further scheme to support the demonstration of new technologies to help the agriculture sector, particularly the pig and poultry industries, to meet the requirements of the nitrates directive. The scheme envisages the granting of financial support for up to ten projects for the treatment of livestock manures and the maximum eligible investment ceiling per project will be &euro;1 million with a grant rate of 40%. The Exchequer contribution will therefore be a maximum of &euro;4 million for this scheme. The scheme will be introduced as soon as the required EU approval is received.</P>
      <P>My Department, working in conjunction with Teagasc and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will do everything in its power to explain the new nitrates regulations to farmers. A farmers&rsquo; handbook, explaining the main provisions of the regulations in plain language, is ready to go to print and on to the website as soon as the nutrient limits in the regulations are finalised. Information meetings <Col N="117"/>will be arranged with the help of Teagasc. To help farmers with record keeping, my Department will send them an organic nitrogen statement every year. This will be taken from the Department&rsquo;s own cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, records and area aid information, and will inform them of the quantity of organic nitrogen produced by their cattle per hectare.</P>
      <P>I am aware that many of the comments in recent days and weeks have worried farmers. It is not an overstatement that they are frightened of the impact of the nitrates directive. That is not necessary and it is time for the farm organisations, Teagasc staff, private advisers and my Department to bring some balance to the discussion. Farmers will not be forced out of business left, right and centre. They will not be forced to operate at uneconomic levels of fertilisation. They will not be hounded under the single payment scheme or tormented with extra inspections.</P>
      <P>The two Departments concerned, with a great deal of extremely valuable input from Teagasc, have discussed the matter with the Commission for several years. The negotiations were prolonged and difficult, not least in respect of the technical details, which came under extremely critical scrutiny from the Commission. The Commission has its own scientific experts, who are not easily persuaded. Nevertheless, the critical tables on nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisation rates in the regulations are in line with good agricultural practice and agronomic requirements as defined by Teagasc.</P>
      <P>Acceptance by the Commission&rsquo;s experts of Teagasc&rsquo;s scientific data was in itself an achievement by the Irish negotiating team. Teagasc has indicated that it may be possible to review part of its advice in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. Therefore, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, having consulted the Commission, has agreed to a short deferral of that part of the regulations which deals with nutrient management. Both the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I have made it clear that if Teagasc comes forward with revised phosphate tables that are supported by robust underlying scientific evidence, the Government will be prepared to make a case to the European Commission to revise the current limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no movement on nitrogen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the regulations were made before Christmas, we were able to start to pursue our case for a derogation for certain farmers from the organic nitrogen limit set by the directive with the Commission and other member states. The proposal is designed to allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg. This is particularly vital for <Col N="118"/>farmers in the more intensive dairy sector. My Department has taken the lead role in this matter and, with the support of Teagasc, will continue to work with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government towards achieving a successful outcome. For the sake of the farmers who need this derogation, it is essential that we get clarity on the regulations as quickly as possible so that the negotiations can go ahead.</P>
      <P>A decision on the future of beet growing in Ireland will be a commercial decision by the stakeholders concerned, having regard to the reformed EU sugar regime which will apply from 1 July. While the regime had remained largely unchanged for 40 years, its reform was inevitable and could no longer be postponed due to internal and international pressures.</P>
      <P>The political agreement reached at the Council in November with regard to reform of the regime was the culmination of protracted and difficult negotiations. I engaged with the stakeholders on a regular basis and had their full support for my negotiating stance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must be joking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The outcome, from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, was the best possible deal in the circumstances. The main features of the reform package have been widely publicised. We succeeded in having the proposals changed to provide a longer phasing-in period, as well as a number of options to enable the sector to adapt to the new regime. There will be a lower reduction in the support price of sugar than originally proposed, namely, 36% instead of 39%, as well as the phasing-in of the corresponding reduction in the minimum sugar beet price over four years, instead of the two step reduction originally proposed.</P>
      <P>We also secured an enhanced compensation package. Beet growers will be compensated for up to 64% of the price reduction in the form of direct payments, which will be worth approximately &euro;123 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years. A once-off payment of almost &euro;44 million will also become available under the diversification heading, in the event that sugar beet production ceases in Ireland. In that event also, an aid package of up to &euro;145 million becomes available for economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring the Irish sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. This will involve the submission of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry. The reform agreement provides that at least 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. This proportion may be increased by member states after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance <Col N="119"/>between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. The entire compensation package for Irish stakeholders has an estimated value in excess of &euro;310 million.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The final legal texts giving effect to the reform agreement have yet to be adopted. They could not be considered and approved by the Council of Ministers until the opinion of the European Parliament had been received. That opinion was delivered on 19 January. It is expected the legal texts, which are being discussed at technical level in Brussels, will be approved by the Council at its meeting later this month. In these discussions we have succeeded in removing the requirement to deliver beet in the year preceding renunciation of quota to qualify for restructuring aid. In parallel, the EU Commission is working on preparation of detailed implementation arrangements which can only be finalised once the Council texts have been adopted. Until all the various legal texts have been adopted, it will not be possible to finalise the implementation arrangements definitively but all parties concerned fully appreciate the importance of having this process completed as soon as possible. I have continued to keep in close touch with the stakeholders about these developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>What about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am prohibited from being definitive on the basis that I have not received the legal text. The question asked in the context of the political agreement prior to the decision of the Council in December was whether the sugar company has to pay a levy in the year it renounces the quota and the answer was no. The implication of that must be finalised in the legal texts. Political agreement will be reached in February. Unfortunately, I cannot give a definitive reply on these issues until 20 and 21 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>When must it be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not have to be paid in the year the company renounces the quota but other issues must be dealt with before a decision is reached on 20 and 21 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this the final year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked a particular question and received a particular reply. I cannot say anything definitive in a legal vacuum and without the availability of the legal texts. I have asked the sugar beet representatives to wait until 20 and 21 February when we will be a position to be definitive on that matter.</P>
      <P>Food labelling is of great importance. Consumers need to be provided with full information on foodstuffs and that is why the food labelling group was introduced. Nineteen of the group&rsquo;s 21 <Col N="120"/>recommendations, many of which went beyond the remit of my Department, have been activated with a number of others to be completed. We all agree the issue of substantial transformation must be addressed. I have not received much support at European level on this matter but I have restated my concerns, particularly to Commissioner Kyprianou. Despite the lack of EU legislation, we introduced a Bill in the House and, hopefully, the matter will be finalised as quickly as possible. There are concerns about products imported into the Community and I have raised them with the Commission. I am sure we will get as much political support as possible to address consumer and producer concerns.</P>
      <P>Agriculture and the agrifood sector is in a period of major transition but it is vitally important to Ireland. I will provide a broad framework for the future development of agriculture and in tandem with farmers, State agencies, my Department and I look forward to developing the full potential of this important industry in the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Johnny Brady.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned REPS in her speech and I congratulate her and her officials for making such an excellent scheme available to farmers. Mayo has one of the highest participation levels in the country. More than 5,500 farmers are in REPS and last year their payments came to more than &euro;32 million. It is vital to safeguard the future of REPS for all farmers. I wish the Minister every success in her negotiations with the Commission on REPS 4. It is important that those negotiations are not overshadowed by difficulties with the nitrates directive.</P>
      <P>I welcome that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, has put aspects of the nitrates regulations on hold until Teagasc can review its scientific advice. It is important these regulations, which will have an impact on so many farmers, are based on the best scientific advice we can get but, whatever may come out of this temporary deferral of part of the regulations, the nitrates directive is in place and we have to live with it. Like most Members, I have been approached by many farmers who are worried about what it may mean for them and there is a great deal of uncertainty. It is important that farmers should be given clear information as soon as possible, and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments about information meetings and a simple handbook for farmers. When farmers know where they stand, they can plan for the future but the uncertainty worries them.</P>
      <P>I refer to the issue of the nitrates regulations as they affect REPS farmers. The Minister stated recently that REPS farmers and planners can carry on as before as far as nutrient management is concerned. As far as other aspects of the <Col N="121"/>nitrates regulations are concerned, they will have some impact on a certain number of REPS farmers. The closed periods for spreading may be slightly longer than they have in their REPS contracts, and they may need to get extra storage capacity. Based on the inquiries I have made, however, I am satisfied the impact will be minor. As far as extra storage capacity is concerned. REPS farmers have the same time as every other farmer to meet the new requirements &mdash; up to the end of 2008 &mdash; and they can also take advantage of the improved grants under the farm waste management scheme.</P>
      <P>The nitrates regulations will also require farmers to keep records, but REPS farmers are already well used to keeping records. The only extra item they will now have to record is the amount of concentrates that they feed to grazing livestock. On the issue of record keeping, it is good news that the Department will use CMMS to give every farmer a statement of the amount of organic nitrogen that his or her cattle are producing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>What will a 75-year old farmer outside Knock do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>It was noticeable that Labour Party Members were not present when the Deputy contributed but they were present to hear the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. The Deputy&rsquo;s Green Party colleagues were also not present.</P>
      <P>The section of the regulations that Deputy Roche has deferred deals with nutrient management. As the section stands, some of the more extensive REPS farmers would be allowed to use less chemical fertiliser and this would also apply to other farmers. The work that Teagasc is doing may lead to a change in these rules but, in any event, through better spreading technology and better timing, farmers can improve the efficiency of livestock manure and that this would compensate for a reduction in chemical fertiliser. Grant aid for the new technology will be provided in the improved farm waste management scheme, which will be a big help.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on her work. I wish her well and she has the full support of this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on her Trojan work on behalf of the farming community. Since assuming office 16 months ago, her efforts at the Cabinet table, at EU level and at the WTO negotiations in Hong Kong last December have been second to none. The agriculture industry is in safe hands with the Minister and her two Ministers for State. It is cheap of Fine Gael to table a vote of no confidence in the Minister. As chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture Food, I have met many members of the farming community from across the political spectrum who have the height of respect for the Minister. I meet these people every day. I meet <Col N="122"/>people from the Fine Gael Party who say they are very lucky to have a capable Minister, who cares about the interests of agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Chomhairle. I will add three and a half minutes to my time which I wish to share with Deputy Penrose and Deputy Sherlock.</P>
      <P>The debate is to be welcomed because it is not just about the future of agriculture but about the future of rural Ireland, which cannot be separated. If rural Ireland is to survive in the way we would like, we must bring together the responsibility for the management of agriculture, rural development and food production under one roof. It is a very artificial separation that rural Ireland and rural development is separate from the Department of Agriculture and Food. We need the same Minister to be responsible for agriculture and rural development. If Ireland is to survive, we must give that one Minister responsibility for food. The future of rural Ireland and <Col N="123"/>agriculture depends on a joined-up approach in Government.</P>
      <P>What should the Minister with responsibility for agriculture, rural development and food do to save Irish farming, and what is wrong with the current Government? Despite Deputy Carty&rsquo;s passionate description of how great it is, I have a few challenges to the questions he raised. The nitrates directive and food labelling are two aspects I want to address. My colleagues, Deputy Penrose and Deputy Sherlock will address, in particular, the nitrates and sugar beet aspects. I also want to speak on the nitrates directive and food labelling.</P>
      <P>It is clear that a total mess has been made of the nitrates directive. None of us will deny that while there was a need for a nitrates directive, a fudge has taken place in recent weeks, especially in the past ten or 12 weeks, in that we did not have a nitrates directive. We had an opportunity to put in place a system that was workable but the Government failed to do so.</P>
      <P>The main problem with the implementation of the nitrates directive is that the Government is insisting on using a statutory instrument to spell out how much or how little fertiliser Irish farmers might spread over their land. However, we know that the land&rsquo;s tolerance of fertiliser varies according to soil conditions, weather and a number of other different factors. This is why a number of other EU countries implemented the directive without stipulating precise amounts. In a number of other EU jurisdictions, farmers will follow a voluntary code of practice and together with a government inspector they will draw up a legally enforceable plan to govern when and how much nitrates they can spread on their land. In other words, an element of common sense will be introduced.</P>
      <P>The value of the system developed elsewhere in Europe is that flexibility which allows for variations in the land&rsquo;s tolerance is built into the legislation transposing the directive. Thanks to this Government,however, Ireland now has more than 50 different straightjackets into which farmers must cram themselves to comply with the legislation and avoid a criminal conviction. The Government, through its unco-ordinated approach to implementing the nitrates directive, is threatening to destroy rural Ireland&rsquo;s largest industry, and with it rural Ireland itself. It is not that the nitrates directive is not important and that we should not have one &mdash; of course, we should. When I examined the figures last week, it occurred to me that one would need a PhD in soil science, an ion-exchange column and perhaps a small laboratory in the garden shed to meet the detail of the requirements.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister saying that there would be simple uncomplicated instructions and guidance for farmers, but I hope they will <Col N="124"/>have moved on significantly from what has already been made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>God help them if they have to decipher the regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The nitrates directive is not the only recent mess for which the Government is responsible in terms of food. I want to speak about food labelling, in particular. We hear almost daily reports of outbreaks of foot and mouth in the cattle herds of countries such as Brazil. Meanwhile, Irish farmers are protesting at the continued importation of potentially diseased Brazilian beef into this country. The Minister made clear to me her view in reply to a parliamentary question in December when I asked if she was satisfied that beef from a country with endemic foot and mouth is still being imported into Europe and taking away potentially the livelihoods of Irish farmers. Her reply was as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">With respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system but that the exporting country provides guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU.</P>
      <P FLI="0">All third countries, like Brazil, must do is provide us with guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU. This means that a guarantee from the Brazilian Government is not equivalent to applying the same standards as Irish farmers must struggle to uphold. A guarantee is a piece of paper. The standards Irish farmers must follow are much more than a piece of paper; they are a way of life. Despite this, we allow the importation of beef from countries with foot and mouth disease on the strength of a piece of paper. A guarantee is just that. It is a piece of paper, not an inspection system, a traceability system or a blood test. We need much more evidence, stringency and labelling.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say that she does not make the rules and that we operate within the constraints of EU law. I will leave aside the point that she represents us in Europe and that we would hope she would make a very strong case on our behalf at the Council of Ministers. While I accept she may not be able to stop Brazilian beef coming into country, she can ensure that we know where it is coming from. The Minister may be happy with a guarantee from the Brazilian Government that its standards are equal to ours, but I do not think the rest of us as consumers are happy about that.</P>
      <P>What is needed is legislation, with the country of origin clearly defined. There must be a level playing pitch in regard to products that are imported and our own home produced products. The country of origin must be defined for all imported meat. A voluntary code of practice is all <Col N="125"/>very well, but there is no way of enforcing it. One should welcome it in so far as it is a step in the right direction, and there is clearly the implication that we are all in favour of having the country of origin and clear labelling on our products, but it cannot be policed or enforced. Therefore, it is crucial to have in place proper legislation.</P>
      <P>The future of farming will not be secure, even if the Minister persuades the Minister, Deputy Roche, to withdraw the nitrates directive in its current form. The future of farming and rural Ireland will only be secure if the Government co-ordinates its approach to rural Ireland, the production of food and the challenges that face agriculture. A number of challenges face agriculture that have not been addressed.</P>
      <P>Countries which achieve the optimum balance on the one hand between profitability in agriculture and food processing and, on the other, society and the consumer&rsquo;s increasing quality requirements will succeed best in the agriculture and food industries in the immediate years ahead. We need that balance. A Minister with responsibility for agriculture, food and rural development might be able to secure this future for Irish farming if we have the courage to meet the challenges with which Irish farming is faced. There are challenges over which no one can have control, but we can address them and try to respond to them. We have relatively little control over climate change. We need consolidation of agri-industrial enterprises, EU subsidies are ending and we have a globalised economy whether we like it or not. These facts may not be very pleasant or helpful, but we must face up to them. We must put in place the systems that will allow agriculture to remain vibrant.</P>
      <P>We must examine the new terminology being used in agriculture, namely, multifunctionality. Multifunctionality embraces food production, quality, safety, the environment, animal welfare and the production of biofuels. It means embracing the knowledge economy in Irish agriculture, but it is difficult to see how we will do that when we cannot roll out broadband in the city of Dublin never mind in more remote parts of the country, yet we talk about the importance of the whole education and information society.</P>
      <P>We need much more research. I acknowledge the moneys and supports that have been given to food research in this country, which is very important, but we have much more to do in that area. We need to establish national capabilities in agrifood biotechnology, for example, and to promote those. We need to quantify the costs and benefits of EU and national environmental policies. We require Government policies that embrace the production of biofuels, not just policies which merely tolerate it. There is scope for that now and there is also an obligation on this country to meet the requirements in regard to biofuels. There is an opportunity to develop it and we should move that forward, not just aiming <Col N="126"/>to reach minimum standards, which we are not yet doing.</P>
      <P>We must combat the rural brain drain. What are we doing to stop young people moving out of rural Ireland? If we do not have such supports as broadband, we are expecting educated, well-informed young people to put up with prehistoric facilities. We need education and training programmes to raise the human resource capabilities of rural business and of rural populations generally. We must be more specific in terms of helping young farmers remain on the land.</P>
      <P>Rural Ireland will face many challenges in the coming years. Judging the Government on its performance on country of origin labelling and the nitrates directive, it does not have the energy to face them. That is why I urge this House to support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this topic again. My colleague, Deputy Upton, has outlined the obstacles and impediments that may well face us in the immediate future, and how we should deal with them.</P>
      <P>An inextricably linked topic is that of getting young people involved in agriculture. In the last week I met young people applying for installation aid. Inspector Clouseau would not do a better job than some of the Department officials. What is happening is an absolute scandal. Documents that are accepted by the Revenue Commissioners are being rejected. Some officials are a law unto themselves. They think they are God Almighty. In one case, instead of helping a 24-year old young man to get started on the farm he had bought, they assumed an omnipotence and operated on the basis that nobody but themselves knew anything. They are treating young farmers with contempt.</P>
      <P>I will bring the example to the Minister to show her what has been sent back to the young farmer in question. He was in tears on Sunday when I met him. He is not even in my constituency but, as somebody who is committed to the future of rural Ireland and to the future of agriculture, I am astounded at the barriers that have been placed in his way. Installation aid of &euro;9,000 is very important for a young farmer who has borrowed in excess of &euro;80,000 to buy land. For the life of me I cannot understand what is going on.</P>
      <P>The Minister has missed the boat in regard to Brazilian beef. I am disappointed that a greater effort was not made at the WTO talks. Deputy Upton is correct about what is happening there. I recently read that the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Brazil is becoming more serious; new cases are still being identified and the disease has spread beyond the original area. Efforts there to contain the disease have failed and we must be extremely vigilant in this regard. We have rightly insisted on the highest and most rigid standards in regard to food production here, which we are achieving. Adhering to these high standards is <Col N="127"/>extremely important in the context of food safety and, ultimately, consumer confidence. Why should we accept beef from Brazil, or anywhere else, that does not apply the same high standards from the perspective of traceability, residue testing and general controls on movement?</P>
      <P>It is time we put in place barriers that will ensure people can operate on a level playing pitch and that our consumers can be assured they are getting Irish beef. Perhaps we should do as the French and put a little tricolour on our beef in the way the they did with their lamb which I saw in evidence at the Rungis market. The sticker told people it was French. Much is made of our having to be great Europeans, which we are, but the French also claim they are great Europeans while at the same time demarcating their own products. Let us label our own products and let us not be afraid. That will tell people where the beef is produced and what has gone into its production. All that information is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I studied agricultural science many years ago but I do not know what went wrong with the nitrates directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Penrose did not learn about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>It requires that the good farming practice code should be made legally binding in nitrate vulnerable zones. Farm organisations had no problem with that requirement being implemented in law. Can the Minister explain what went wrong? The authoritative Teagasc publication on nutrient and trace element advice for grassland and tillage crops is referred to as the &lsquo;green book&rsquo;. It is the code of good practice in this area &mdash; in effect, it is the bible for farmers. It gave people usage levels for fertilisers and so on. It is also the reference document on the specification for nitrates and phosphorous use for participation in the REP scheme.</P>
      <P>Somebody intervened but nobody knows who it was. We cannot gain access to the documents that were used. We do not know who wrote them. Everybody went to ground when the pressure was felt. Who devised this? Who were the authors? From where did they get their information and from what scientific basis did they arrive at this conclusion? They have made a shambles of the whole thing. We will end up with a large number of people being ousted from farming activities. I do not speak of big farmers either. People with REPS plans in place will find they will not be able to achieve their targets. Where do we go from here?</P>
      <P>Ongoing communication evidently took place between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the farming organisations, so why did we end up at this point? The Department of Agriculture and Food evi<Col N="128"/>dently accepted the thrust and genesis of the &lsquo;green book&rsquo;, which was considered the best advice for farmers from Teagasc&rsquo;s farm advisers. It was accepted as part of the REPS 3 process that was agreed in early 2005. What happened and who intervened to say it was no longer acceptable? From where did the evidence come? Who blew the house down? Some official must be responsible and he or she should be identified. This matter is too serious to be ignored.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have to delete most of the provisions from the regulations enacted in SI 788 of 2005. There is no use fiddling around with it. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, should prevail upon the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to delete the regulations and go back to the drawing board. If necessary we should get independent scientific advice but we should not introduce something that would sound the death knell for Irish farming.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1990 I was the only Deputy on this side of the House to oppose the Fianna F&aacute;il policy to privatise the sugar industry. Section 2 of the legislation at that time provided a golden share for the Minister for Agriculture and Food which would give the Minister a say in what the sugar company could do under the Greencore regime. The Minister should tell us clearly whether she thinks Mallow sugar factory will be producing sugar beyond 2008 and if the decision hinges on whether the IFA will accept the compensation package. The IFA appears to be dictating the terms in this regard.</P>
      <P>The factory at Mallow has produced sugar since 1933, that is 40 years before we joined the Common Market and 40 years before a subsidy was ever paid to beet growers. How come we cannot do that now? The Irish sugar industry depends on 72,000 acres for the production of the beet crop. The Mallow plant processes 1.2 million tonnes of sugar and under the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats regime that will be no more. I say to the Minister that this matter is not over yet.</P>
      <P>The decision of the EU Council of Ministers to overhaul the sugar industry begs serious questions about the negotiating position of the Minister for Agriculture and Food in these talks. Why is there such uncertainty surrounding the future of the industry when it is clearly profitable and viable? Why have a ridiculous situation, whereby the IFA president, Mr. P&aacute;draig Walsh, has accused Greencore of planning a massive cash grab in compensation for the shutdown of the Irish industry while the growers of north Cork are holding firm in favour of retaining a viable industry?</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous that the Minister will not be able to tell us until the Council of Ministers meets in 20 February next whether she or the Irish sugar industry must pay the &euro;25 million restructuring levy if a crop is grown in 2006. The Minister has <Col N="129"/>given an assurance that there will be no compulsory growing of sugar beet in 2006 in order to qualify for the restructuring fund. Added to this is the EU Commission warning that growers must reduce their production quotas in 2006 on the basis of overproduction. Does this mean that the Commission will seek to reduce production quotas for 2006-07?</P>

      <P>We need a clear statement from the Government on this matter. The workers want to keep working and the growers want to keep growing. It is clear that the negotiating position adopted by the Minister in Brussels was at variance with that of the growers in north Cork. Is there a disparity between the growers&rsquo; position and that of the IFA which is calling the shots here? Every grower to whom I spoke wants to keep growing the crop. The workers in Mallow have the right to know what the future holds for them. As the negotiating position taken by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for debate. Obviously I would have concerns about the proposed closure of St. Davnet&rsquo;s Hospital in Monaghan.</P>
        <P>I have to acknowledge that the need for vast psychiatric institutions does not exist because over the years numbers have fallen dramatically in such institutions, nationally and in St. Davnet&rsquo;s Hospital, Monaghan. The profile of patients within the hospital has changed as well. Effec<Col N="130"/>tively, there is an ageing psycho-geriatric population and an admission unit, although the admission unit comprises more first-time admissions.</P>
        <P>Service delivery has changed to community-based service, as proposed by the report, Planning for the Future, quite a number of years ago. That community-based service is in existence. It is a fact of life and it is working well.</P>
        <P>Recently another report, A Vision for Change, was published. Most of what was contained in Planning for the Future has been reprinted in A Vision for Change. While it envisages community-based services, there are a couple of issues in A Vision for Change about which I have major concerns. One of them is the proposal to close psychiatric admission units. The proposal is for one 50-bed admission unit per 300,000 of the population. This will have serious implications for the health service. It is a crazy proposal, a retrograde step. It puts us back in time, into an institutional form of care and admission units. It is not personal. It is not a good form of service. It baffles me how anyone could recommend what would obviously be an overcrowded 50-bed admission unit to treat acutely ill patients. It is difficult to understand how anybody could recommend more than 18 to 20 persons in an admission unit. They should look at that again.</P>
        <P>We all know that the ethos of psychiatric treatment is to treat the person in the home initially, the community next, the day centre then and an admission unit thereafter, which is preferably close to home. Planning for the Future was all about bringing services to the people, not taking services away from them, which is what this involves. We will not even have an admission unit in Cavan/Monaghan if these proposals go ahead. This is occurring at a time when there is an increasing need for such services. Suicide rates are increasing and there is pressure on society generally. It is not the correct move to make. It is not a well thought through move.</P>
        <P>While there is a proposal to sell St. Davnet&rsquo;s Hospital, we are proud that the World Health Organisation has adopted the Cavan/Monaghan model of care as best practice, one to be followed and copied internationally. We should take a closer look at that.</P>
        <P>The St. Davnet&rsquo;s complex is like a village or campus. It contains quite a number of services other than the psychiatric hospital. It is a thriving community. It includes two community hostels, three private houses, a local health unit, the headquarters of the health care services for County Monaghan, a day centre training unit for the intellectually disabled, a residential intellectual disability unit, Enable Ireland which the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, opened a short time ago, a third level education centre, an occupation unit, a sheltered industrial therapy unit, a 40-bed nursing home, day centres, day hospitals, laundries, admission units and psycho-geriatric units. A large volume of day patients are using <Col N="131"/>this service. The service there is operating effectively and we should not ignore that it has been adopted as a model of care by the World Health Organisation.</P>
        <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>One could sell these hostels and there would be a short-term gain, but we should look again at this policy of selling off the family silver such as excellent sites in the centre of towns. There is an undesirable practice within the health service of renting premises. Many Departments throughout the public service rent, rather than purchase, premises. This is a fantastic site, located in the centre of a town, which could possibly be sold off. We should be getting back to the Departments and asking whether they have need of a greenfield site, whether there is a need for an Irish school in Monaghan, for a theatre or for a third level college which could be built on the complex. It would offer a fantastic greenfield site for decentralisation. Selling should not be top of the agenda.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>We should take another look. If there is a better location for a psychiatric unit they should consider it. In the case of St. Davnet&rsquo;s, however, such a better option does not exist. It is a fantastic site, a lovely leafy place with lawns, a private and dignified place for somebody who is ill and a good environment to facilitate recovery. If the Minister of State can get a better location in a general hospital, he may opt for it but I do not believe one exists.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Connolly for raising this matter.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of A Vision for Change which outlines an exciting vision of the future for mental health services in Ireland and sets out a famework for action to achieve it over the next seven to ten years. This report is the first comprehensive review of mental health policy since Planning for the Future was published in 1984 and has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of mental health policy.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change recommends that specialist expertise should be provided by community mental health teams, CMHTs, expanded multidisciplinary teams of clinicians who work together to serve the needs of service users across their lifespan. Community mental health teams should serve defined populations and age groups and operate from community-based mental health centres in specific sectors throughout re-configured mental health catchment areas. Some of these CMHTs should be established on a regional or national basis to address the complex mental health needs of specific categories of people who are few in number but who require particular expertise.</P>
        <P>Recent years have seen dramatic changes in both the concept and innovative practice of mental health care delivery in the Cavan/Monagahan <Col N="132"/>mental health service. These changes have been very much in line with the model of service provision now recommended by the expert group.</P>
        <P>The focus of mental health service provision in Cavan/Monaghan is to work towards a community-based model of care, supporting, caring for, and treating people with mental illness who are living in their own communities. This is being achieved through a range of services, which include out-patient clinics, day hospitals, home visits, community residences and supported accommodation as well as working in collaboration with voluntary organisations. This approach to care delivery has resulted in a sharp decline in the number of acute inpatient admissions to the admission unit at St. Davnet&rsquo;s Hospital. A Vision for Change envisions an active, flexible and community-based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. This has already taken place to a great extent in Cavan-Monaghan, as I have outlined. The expert group stated in the report:</P>
        <P LI="1">Mental hospitals have been the mainstay of mental health services in Ireland for many years. However, the type of person-centred, recovery-oriented care recommended cannot be provided in institutions of this size or environment in the future.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On that basis, the group has recommended that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all the remaining psychiatric hospitals which are a legacy of a bygone age and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health services.</P>
        <P>The closure of the large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984. Several large psychiatric hospitals around the country have already been closed, including Our Lady&rsquo;s in Cork, St. Patrick&rsquo;s in CastIerea, St. Columba&rsquo;s in Sligo, St. Mary&rsquo;s in Castlebar and Our Lady&rsquo;s in Ennis. The reorganisation of services which these closures entailed has resulted in the expansion of community facilities, new acute psychiatric units in some cases and most importantly an overall improvement in the delivery of services for the service users, their families and carers.</P>
        <P>Most of the remaining stand-alone psychiatric hospitals cater in the main for long-stay patients, many of whom are over 65 years of age. This is also the case at St. Davnet&rsquo;s Hospital, Monaghan, where the majority of patients are cared for in elderly care wards.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that a plan be drawn up for the phased closure of each of the hospitals. It is recommended that this plan consist of a four-stage process: identify measures required to enable admissions to cease and put these measures in place; cease admissions to the <Col N="133"/>hospital and draw up plans for relocation of existing patients; implement plans for the relocation of existing patients; and final closure of the hospital. This process should take place on a phased basis with wards closing sequentially and will require funding for training and upskilling of staff who will then be redeployed to work within the mental health services provided in the community.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has welcomed the publication of this report and stated that the national mental heaIth directorate within the HSE will immediately establish an implementation group to ensure the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner. The HSE has also emphasised that hospitals can close only when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to the implementation of this report, which has been accepted as the basis for the future development of mental health services. This is Government policy and has been accepted widely by service users and carers in the service. I hope the level of debate in future will enhance the services for people with mental illnesses and that no one will try to exploit the vulnerability of mental health patients.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the announcement last Friday of the closure by Irish Pride of its plant in Kanturk. This results in the loss of 76 full-time and 20 part-time jobs in the town.</P>
        <P>This bakery started out as Keating&rsquo;s Bakery until Irish Pride took it over in 1997. Many generations of Kanturk people have worked in the industry which provided much needed employment in the town since 1914 when Keating&rsquo;s Bakery first opened. The closure has baffled the workers. I spoke to many of them on Friday evening and to management and local people over the weekend. They do not know why Irish Pride closed the Kanturk bakery although it was the first bakery and one of the only ones to receive the ISO 9002 award.</P>
        <P>Yesterday on the local radio station the shop steward spoke of the shock, dismay and anger of the workers. Many of the workers who heard the news at 4 p.m. on Friday have mortgages and borrowings, and spending commitments for education and so on. It is a terrible blow to them and also to the people of Kanturk.</P>
        <P>For some time people in the area surrounding Kanturk have been baffled by the failure of State agencies to attract industry into the area. Over the past eight or nine years I have been in constant contact with the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the State agencies, and more recently with the cur<Col N="134"/>rent Minister, Deputy Martin. I brought the chief executive officers of the main State agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, there to try to advance the issue of creating jobs in Kanturk.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister is taking the debate in person tonight. What efforts have these State agencies made to market Kanturk? There is a great deal of employment in the surrounding towns, Millstreet, Charleville, Newmarket and Mallow. Unfortunately, we seem to have a serious problem attracting employment into Kanturk, the capital of the Duhallow region, one of the oldest and largest baronies in the country. It has a central location, although many years ago people did not think so. However it is close to Cork city, Tralee, Limerick and to the airports in Cork and Farranfore and the port of Cork. It is baffling that it is unable to sustain employment.</P>
        <P>In 2000, after the Government announced its decision to consider towns as locations for decentralisation I made a submission to the Department of Finance suggesting Kanturk for this programme. Great credit is due to the Government for announcing its inclusion in the decentralisation programme, but that was two years ago. We need to move that agenda forward, particularly in light of the closure of the Irish Pride bakery and bring jobs into Kanturk.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister and all the agencies under the aegis of his Department to get together. I spoke on Friday afternoon to the new assistant county manager in charge of north Cork and to many agencies since then. As somebody said at the weekend it is time to get off the fence, take the finger out and take action for Kanturk. The town has many attractions as one of the central towns of Duhallow. I am fed up listening to people say they are marketing the town and so forth. It is time for real action. We need to reassure the workers who left Irish Pride on Friday evening that all the State agencies, the Government and I as a local representative, are doing all that we can to ensure employment is found for this wonderful town and people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I too was very concerned to hear that Irish Pride Bakeries Limited in Kanturk had announced that it was closing with the loss of 76 full-time and 20 part-time jobs.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the effect these job losses will have on the workers involved and their families, as well as the community in the surrounding area. This is very disappointing news for those who will lose their jobs given the long history of the bakery as outlined by Deputy Moynihan.</P>
        <P>The State agencies will provide every support they can. The priority will be to find alternative employment for those involved. The job losses will be in production and administration but ten distribution jobs will be maintained. The reason for the closure is that it is no longer viable for the <Col N="135"/>company to continue, as the Kanturk bakery is loss-making and is no longer a viable production unit. The company was reviewing the situation for some time and, unfortunately, has arrived at this decision.</P>
        <P>The industry has changed significantly in the past few years in response to more competitive market conditions. In view of the bakery&rsquo;s lack of viability, main-line production items will be transferred to Irish Pride&rsquo;s other plants in County Wexford and County Mayo. The company is consulting employees&rsquo; representatives regarding the proposed redundancies and consultations will continue over the coming weeks. The decision to close is no reflection on the workforce but rather a recognition of the commercial realities of operating in the bread market and the company&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>The role of F&Aacute;S, the State training agency, will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs. The agency has contacted the company, and a meeting has been arranged for Friday next. The full range of services will be made available to the affected workers and we urge them to avail themselves of them. F&Aacute;S has worked to great effect on similar situations in other localities where this has occurred. Finding alternative employment for the workers will be a priority for the State development agencies. I assure Deputies that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in addition to F&Aacute;S, will play their part in developing a way forward for the affected workers and the surrounding area.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland supported an initiative for the bakery in Kanturk under its Techstart programme in 1998. The agency&rsquo;s policy for the bakery sector is to support those companies that are exporting or demonstrating the capability to be able to service export markets. Enterprise Ireland also provides supports to the sector through research and development initiatives. The company has invested &euro;10 million in Taghmon, County Wexford, which includes a new state-of-the-art plant that is doubling its capacity to produce a world-class range of products.</P>
        <P>I know that IDA Ireland is promoting north Cork to potential investors from across the full range of its targeted sectors such as pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, information and communications technologies and internationally traded services. Every effort will be made to secure new, advanced, knowledge-based industry for the area. The agency&rsquo;s strategy for the county is to advance the development of a knowledge economy so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment and to work with the existing IDA Ireland client base to help them to develop further their presence in County Cork.</P>
        <P>The recognition of the importance of Cork city as a major gateway location and Mallow as a hub will assist in promoting the entire region for <Col N="136"/>inward investment. The town of Kanturk is marketed as part of the broader north Cork area. While IDA Ireland has only one client company in Kanturk, Packo Blackwater, which employs 32 people, it also has a land holding of 2.6 hectares available to both indigenous and overseas companies. Alps Electric, based in nearby Millstreet, which employs approximately 450 people, announced an expansion of its operation in December 2005, with the creation of 140 new jobs. I met the personnel and management of Alps Electric last year, when they came to see us. Other significant IDA Ireland-supported employers in the north Cork area include Molex in Millstreet, FCI and Sanmina SCI in Fermoy, and Kostal in Mallow.</P>
        <P>I know that the loss of any full-time or part-time job is a severe blow to the Kanturk area. While I in no way wish to underestimate the loss of the bakery jobs, I am encouraged about the future in so far as County Cork is concerned. Already in 2006, two new projects have been announced for Cork which will result in 1,350 new jobs at full production. The recent Amgen announcement of 1,100 new jobs at an &euro;820 million facility is of particular importance. That major global project has chosen Cork as its development location. In addition, Citco will create 250 new financial services jobs.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the ongoing efforts of the industrial development agencies and local interests will continue to provide investment and job opportunities for Cork city and county. I will work with the Deputies and representatives from the local area to do all we possibly can to secure alternative industry for the Kanturk area.</P>

      <sTitle>Tribunals of Inquiry.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Next Tuesday marks the 25th anniversary of one of the greatest tragedies in the history of this State, the deaths of 48 young people in the Stardust club in Artane, Dublin 5. Most of those victims came from the ward and constituency that I have represented for the past 15 years. The publication of the tribunal of inquiry report in June 1982 was marked by incredulity on the part of many of the victims&rsquo; families. Despite modest payments to victims and relatives&rsquo; families in the mid-1980s, there has always been a sense of injustice and lack of closure among the people of Coolock, Raheny and the adjoining districts that I represent.</P>
        <P>Those feelings have intensified in recent years. The book <i>They Never Came Home</i> by two distinguished young north-side journalists, Mr. Tony McCullagh and Mr. Neil Fetherstonhaugh, raised serious questions about the Stardust tribunal&rsquo;s investigations of the club&rsquo;s electrical system and the seat of the fire&rsquo;s outbreak. The book is, of course, the basis of a two-part film made by RTE that will be shown this Sunday and Monday.</P><Col N="137"/>
        <P>Approximately two years ago, I became aware that the Stardust victims&rsquo; committee had commissioned a new report from Ms Geraldine Foy to re-examine the key conclusions of the Stardust tribunal. That report rejected the conclusion that the fire had been started deliberately and seriously challenged the Stardust tribunal inquiry about the location and cause of the fire. Arising from that later report, a delegation of Stardust victims&rsquo; relatives and I met Mr. Se&aacute;n Aylward, Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and his principal officer, Mr. Noel Sinnott, in November 2004. The Stardust committee and its advisers walked out of the meeting in dismay at the officials&rsquo; indication that the establishment of a further tribunal of inquiry could not be recommended. However, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, stated that any material submitted by the solicitor for the Stardust relatives might be reviewed by the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
        <P>Tonight I call again for the establishment of a new tribunal of inquiry into the Stardust fire of 1981. The works referred to above and new information that has become available make the conclusions of the Keane Stardust tribunal report, which I have here, untrustworthy, unfair and unsafe. Some of the key points that must be re-examined include the following. First, there was a clear conflict of interest in the appointment of the fire research station of the UK Department of the Environment as expert adviser to the tribunal, since it was working for Dublin Corporation at the time, a body with grave responsibility for the tragedy.</P>
        <P>The Stardust was never inspected by the fire service and a litany of breaches of the building by-laws and public resort laws was revealed in the Keane report. Section 8.92 of the tribunal report states: &ldquo;the practice of locking and chaining the exit doors until midnight at the earliest on disco night was not known to the Corporation&rdquo;. That statement is untrue. A few days ago a city council official rang me and informed me that he had reported to officials in the building controls section over three weeks before the catastrophe that exit doors had been locked late into the night at a function at which a friend had been present. It is further reported that a corporation staff party had been held in the Stardust the previous Christmas, 1980, and that the then Lord Mayor was present. That official was interviewed in the presence of the city architect by garda&iacute;, yet the evidence does not seem to have reached the tribunal.</P>
        <P>Third, conclusion 9.64 in the Keane tribunal report refers to serious shortcomings in the forensic examination by the garda&iacute; and the Department of Justice, concluding that samples of material that might have been crucial were not taken and that important tests were not carried out. It is also clear that Mr. Eamon Butterly, the owner, and several of his staff seriously <Col N="138"/>obstructed the Garda investigations. For those reasons alone, a new tribunal is essential.</P>
        <P>Fourth, the Keane tribunal report concludes that there was no professional supervision of the electrical system in the reconstruction and fitting out of the Scott&rsquo;s Food factory that became the Stardust. However, the report disregarded compelling evidence relating to the electrical system and new research has challenged the tribunal&rsquo;s findings.</P>
        <P>Fifth, in the light of those new findings and much testimony that is clearly present in the Stardust tribunal&rsquo;s report of 1982 from disco-goers and outside witnesses, it now seems clear that the fire began in the store room and spread through the roof space until it exploded over the dancers. Mr. Justice Keane concluded:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">the cause of the fire is not known and may never be known. There is no evidence of an accidental origin and equally no evidence that the fire was started deliberately.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That was point 6.139 of the report. However, with such conflicting evidence, it bizarrely concluded that the most probable cause was that the fire had been deliberately started in the west alcove and not in the roof space.</P>
        <P>Sixth, it is incredible that no one has ever been brought to account for the Stardust tragedy. The owner, Mr. Eamon Butterly, was severely criticised for his actions, but why was no prosecution pursued? The city management of the day was never called to account for its failure to implement even the existing planning and building and public resort by-laws.</P>
        <P>As we approach the 25th anniversary of this appalling disaster, no counselling service has ever been provided for the survivors or relatives of victims. Recent media reports confirm that several families have suffered because their loved ones have never been identified. Many people ask why the most modern forensic techniques cannot be used to put those citizens&rsquo; minds at rest at last. Relatives and survivors to whom I have spoken continue to ask for justice so that they can find some measure of closure regarding this horrific disaster. Such closure can come only when the issues outlined above, among others, are addressed. The most practical way to do that is for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Government to launch a new Stardust tribunal of inquiry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important matter this evening. I am sure that the entire House joins the Minister and me in expressing our sympathy and support for the families as the anniversary of the tragedy approaches. I fully understand the families&rsquo; concerns regarding the background to the tragedy, and the Minister and the Department will assist them in any way they can. It is for that reason <Col N="139"/>that officials from the Department have met representatives of the families on several occasions in recent years. These discussions led in 2004 to the presentation to the Department of a submission prepared on behalf of the Stardust victims committee and which examined a range of issues relating to the fire and its investigation. This submission was forwarded to the Garda Commissioner and to the forensic science laboratory for examination as to whether it constituted new evidence or material otherwise not dealt with by the tribunal of inquiry. Both the Garda Commissioner and the forensic science laboratory responded to the Department stating that the report contained no new evidence.</P>
        <P>More specifically, the forensic science laboratory concluded that the report in question amounted to a different interpretation of matters already brought to the attention of the tribunal and not new evidence. Similarly, the Garda response concluded that no new evidence was forthcoming that would warrant the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na revisiting the investigation and that all the matters raised in the report had been adequately addressed by the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
        <P>A meeting was subsequently held in November 2004 between the Stardust victims committee and officials of the Department, including the Secretary General of the Department who attended on behalf of the Minister. The committee was informed of the views of the Garda Commissioner and the forensic science laboratory and advised that in the absence of compelling new evidence, the establishment of a further tribunal of inquiry could not be recommended.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister is of the view it is important to note that the original inquiry carried out by the former Chief Justice was a substantial and extensive examination with comprehensive terms of reference. It sat for 122 days and heard evidence from 363 witnesses, 161 of whom were present in the building on the night of the fire. The tribunal had available to it a range of national and international expertise in matters relating to fire safety and building construction and detailed forensic and pathology evidence was also heard.</P>
        <P>In drawing attention to the extent of the original inquiry, the Minister&rsquo;s intention is not to suggest that it cannot be revisited but rather to highlight that the grounds for doing so would have to be substantial. At the November meeting it was, however, made clear to the delegation that any further submission they or their representatives wished to make would be carefully examined. The present situation is that no new information has been brought to the Department&rsquo;s attention since then and that there is essentially no further advice that the Department can give to the families other than that conveyed at the meeting in November 2004.</P><Col N="140"/>
        <P>It remains the cases that any submission received will be examined and in that light the Department has forwarded recent correspondence from the committee to the forensic science laboratory for its observations. The Minister&rsquo;s Department will keep the committee fully informed of any developments arising out from this and he will meet a delegation from the families if there is some new information or advice he can usefully give.</P>

      <sTitle>Garda Deployment.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important and serious matter.</P>
        <P>It is not alarmist to state that Lifford has fallen victim to a crime wave. In recent weeks, there has been a spate of criminality, most notably a succession of fires of a suspicious nature, with property damage estimated at more than &euro;1 million and six houses burned out. On top of these arson attacks, criminal incidents have included the desecration of a graveyard, a number of armed robberies, cars burned out, a shooting, a stabbing and a litany of incidents of anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>It is quite clear that the crime problem in the area has escalated in recent times and the mostly law-abiding local residents must be fearful for their safety. Because Lifford is a Border town, some of the incidents are cross-Border intrusions and the criminals perpetrate their attacks and simply retreat back across the Border. As Lifford Garda station does not operate on a 24-hour basis, these criminals believe they can operate with impunity. The answer is obviously an increase in Garda numbers to tackle this very worrying growth in criminal activity.</P>
        <P>The present total Garda strength in Lifford is approximately 12 to 13 personnel. Not alone must they cover the Lifford station area but they must also give cover to the sub-station areas of Castlefinn, Raphoe and Carrigans. These stations are only open a limited number of hours daily. This means that outside the hours of 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Lifford station is more often closed than open. Such a situation creates a vacuum which certain people are only too willing to exploit.</P>
        <P>Until recently, Lifford Garda station had a complement of upwards of 50 garda&iacute; and this was as a result of the security situation across the bridge in Northern Ireland. Very few towns in County Donegal or indeed in Ireland, had a more visible Garda presence than Lifford. Since the cessation of paramilitary operations in Northern Ireland, Lifford Garda station has been drastically downgraded to its present strength. There are so few garda&iacute; on duty with such a huge area to cover that there is a virtual breakdown of communications between the local population and the Garda authorities. What is the point in going to the Garda station to report a crime when there is no one there to whom to report it?</P><Col N="141"/>
        <P>The criminal incidents in Lifford in recent times are not of a minor nature, being in the first category of violent crime. Arson is a serious crime because not alone is property destroyed, there can also be loss of innocent lives. The same goes for armed robbery. The people in Lifford feel isolated, vulnerable and exposed to these attacks.</P>
        <P>There have been incidents of desecration of holy places, personal attacks with the intent of injuring or maiming, the burning of cars, shootings, stabbings and other anti-social behaviour that cannot and should not be tolerated. The majority of the population of Lifford abhor and condemn these acts. Condemnation is one thing but prevention is another. Garda numbers in Lifford Garda station must be increased to a strength where the station can be open on a 24-hour basis. There can be no short cuts.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister, the Government and the Garda authorities to address this escalating crime situation before it gets out of hand. Prevention is better than cure. This matter must be addressed urgently. The business community in Lifford feels vulnerable and unprotected. No one can predict when the next armed hold-up will take place. So far it is fortunate there has been no loss of life but where firearms are used, anything can happen. It is better to act now than to wait until it is too late.</P>
        <P>Lifford is a good town with good people. It is the administrative capital of County Donegal and it is an historic town. We are proud of its architectural and administrative heritage. We owe it to the residents of the town and its hinterland to end this spate of criminality before it gets completely out of hand. I appeal to the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government to address this problem and to ensure the Garda station in Lifford has the personnel to provide a 24-hour presence so criminality can be addressed before it gets out of hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McGinley for raising this matter. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who unfortunately is unable to be present. I assure the Deputy the Minister and I share his concerns about recent incidents in Lifford.</P>
        <P>Before commenting on the particular matter identified by the Deputy, it would be helpful to put the issue of crime into perspective. The level of headline crime in 2005 is lower than that for 2003 by 1.6% and for 2002 by 4.4%. Furthermore, in 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population.</P>
        <P>It is also important to put on the record that headline crime for the Lifford area in 2005 was actually 12% lower than in 2004. However, the Minister has expressed his disappointment that <Col N="142"/>there was an overall increase of 2.78% in headline crime in 2005 and he does not play down his concerns in that regard. The Minister is giving the highest priority to providing the resources to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle crime. He takes great satisfaction in the Government&rsquo;s decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result, there will be a combined organisational strength of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The Minister has repeatedly promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. The Minister is also pleased that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now better resourced than at any time in its history. The funding for the Garda, which the Minister secured in the Estimates for 2006, is at a historic high of over &euro;1.29 billion, compared to just &euro;600 million in 1997. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 will be &euro;83.5 million, an increase of &euro;23 million on the allocation for last year. This increase will greatly aid the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and in crime prevention generally. The &euro;83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.</P>
        <P>The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; due to the programme of accelerated recruitment into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take place next month. During the allocation of the newly attested personnel, the needs of the Donegal division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social and unlawful behaviour. The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.</P>
        <P>Because of the Minister&rsquo;s concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, he has brought forward tough new provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order. Furthermore, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</P>
        <P>The Minister has recently published the general scheme of the intoxicating liquor Bill 2005. The main purpose of the proposed Bill is to streamline and modernise our liquor licensing laws and it will also contain provisions which will combat anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister recently published his legislative proposals to deal with anti-social behaviour, including pro<Col N="143"/>vision for anti-social behaviour orders. The Minister proposes to introduce these proposals by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House.</P>
        <P>The Minister attaches great importance to the development of a real partnership between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities on matters affecting policing. His intention and that of the Oireachtas, as set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, is that joint policing committees and local policing fora established under them will provide arenas where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities can work together to address local policing and other issues.</P>
        <P>Before addressing the particular issues raised by the Deputy, it is important to re-state that headline crime in Lifford fell by 12% in 2005 <Col N="144"/>compared to 2004. The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the incidents raised by the Deputy are currently under investigation by an investigation team compromising members of detective branch and uniform members under the direction of the district officer at Letterkenny. An incident room has been set up in Letterkenny Garda station to co-ordinate the investigation of these incidents.</P>
        <P>The Minister is assured that all available resources are being deployed in the Lifford area to respond to the current policing demands and with a view to ensuring a concentrated and visible Garda presence in the area, with additional patrols being performed by uniformed officers, detective branch and the traffic corps. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na patrol the area on a 24-hour basis.</P>

	<P>The number of inspector posts in the labour inspectorate of the Department is 31. The assignment of previously announced additional labour inspectors was completed in November 2005. That brought the complement of serving inspectors to 31 officers. That increase in staffing represents almost a doubling of the number of labour inspectors in the past 18 months. However, the Deputy may wish to note that in the past week one officer has commenced a career-break. The vacancy arising as a consequence will be filled next week.</P>

	<P>The 2002 Competition Act prohibits anti-competitive practices in the same way as the prohibitions set down in Articles 81 and 82 of the EU treaty. Section 4 of the Competition Act reflects the prohibitions in Article 81 of the treaty regarding anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices while section 5 mirrors Article 82 of the treaty which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position.</P><Col N="146"/>
        <P>Predatory pricing is an abusive and anti-competitive practice that acts against the interests of consumers. It is a tactic employed by a firm that is dominant in its market and involves the sale of product below cost for a prolonged period in order to damage or eliminate a competitor. Therefore, predatory pricing is already prohibited by section 5 of the Competition Act 2002 which outlaws the abuse of a dominant position and I do not consider that any action is necessary to further outlaw this practice.</P>
        <P>Predatory pricing should not, however, be confused with other forms of low cost selling, such as promotional sales, disposing of old stock, or matching competitors&rsquo; prices. These are legitimate pro-competitive pricing strategies which benefit consumers. Low prices are only predatory when they are reduced in order to subsequently harm consumers through higher prices later.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the resolution of trade disputes is a matter for the parties involved. The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery to assist the dispute resolution process, which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntary in nature. The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing an extensive set of legislative conditions on the parties to a trade dispute.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal, hearing both sides in a trade dispute. It then issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled. Labour Court recommendations for the resolution of trade disputes are not legally binding. However, as the Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to that process in good faith and consequently are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, namely the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
        <P>The procedures set out in the code of practice on grievance and disciplinary procedures are well established and are in line with the voluntarist tradition of Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 13 county and city enterprise boards operating in the Border midlands and western region. Under the BMW regional operational programme 2000-2006, these boards are responsible for delivering the micro-enterprise measure and, in this regard, continue to support, through both financial and non-financial measures, the development of micro-enterprises in the BMW region. The BMW region&rsquo;s Objective One status allows the use of comparatively better rates of incentives to business and assists the region in promoting and developing indigenous micro-enterprises. This status is also taken into account in allocating funds to the boards in the region. In 2005, for example, the funds allocated to the region amounted to some 37% of the total funds allocated even though only about 27% of the national population reside in the region.</P>
        <P>The specific types of CEB assistance available to micro-enterprise is broken down between: measure one &mdash; project support expenditure, including grants for feasibility studies, employment grants and capital grants; and measure two &mdash; soft supports activities such as business advice, management and e-commerce training, enterprise education and programmes aimed as assisting and promoting women in business.</P>
        <P>The function of the CEBs is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level. In providing support to enterprises, the CEBs are required to have regard to the quality, local relevance, cost effectiveness and viability of proposals. They must also seek to avoid supporting projects that would displace existing jobs or businesses. In this regard, the boards are required to give priority to manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, which over time may develop into strong export entities.</P>
        <P>The CEBs in the BMW region performed strongly in 2005. They paid out more than &euro;4 million in direct grant aid to 350 projects and assisted in creating more than 1,000 net jobs in grant-aided companies. The CEBs also provided training and management development programmes to the value of &euro;3.4 million to 4,566 participants in the BMW area, of which 2,588 &mdash; almost 57% &mdash; were female. The local base of the CEBs which are responsible for the delivery of the micro-enterprise measure in the BMW region means that the projects supported are tailored to the <Col N="148"/>particular needs of the local economic environment.</P>
        <P>Overall the CEBs continue to play an extremely important role in the development of the micro-enterprise sector throughout Ireland and it is my intention that an appropriate level of support for the CEBs, in both the BMW region and the south and east region, will be made available again this year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 129 together.</P>
        <P>In the area of pay and conditions, it is primarily the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 that apply to adult workers who are employed in domestic service. Employees, working in the provision of domestic service, as is the case for employees in most other areas of the economy, are not categorised in any unique fashion in current employment legislation.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the publication of a case study document that focused on the circumstances of 20 women working in the provision of domestic services. In this connection I engaged in dialogue with ICTU and others and am, as a result, very conscious of their concerns for the workers providing these services. The possibility of establishing a joint labour committee under the auspices of the Labour Court has been mooted and officials of the Department have been examining the issue. I understand there is ongoing dialogue with the interested parties to determine the feasibility of that approach, including enforcement difficulties arising both from provisions in our Constitution and in the European Convention on Human Rights. I await the outcome of these deliberations.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission commissioned the University of Limerick to carry out a review of the JLC system in 2005. Arising from <Col N="149"/>this review and following bilateral consultations with the social partners and stakeholders, the Department has prepared a paper that will be used as the basis for implementation of the review in further consultation with the social partners and stakeholders, in the context of the forthcoming partnership talks. The issue of a JLC for domestic workers, and proposals for new JLCs for other sectors, will be considered in this context.</P>

	<P>The issues of job creation and retention in companies supported by the industrial development agencies under my remit, is a day-to-day matter for the agencies and not one in which I am directly involved. Employment figures for both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are recorded by Forf&aacute;s in the annual employment survey. Figures for 2006 are not available yet.</P>
        <P>In respect of companies supported by Enterprise Ireland, the agency informs me that the total number of jobs created from 1998 to the end of 2005 is as follows: 1,776 jobs in Carlow; 4,201 jobs in Kildare; 3,428 jobs in Meath; and 4,026 in Wicklow. The new jobs created in the period cover the range of sectors that fall within Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s remit, namely: food, consumer and retail, industrial and internationally traded services. Many of the new jobs created are heavily concentrated in high value-added, knowledge based companies that offer greater security in the face of intense international competition.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland works with companies in its portfolio to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets. The productivity improvement fund, which I launched last year, supports manufacturing companies to adopt advanced technologies and focus on skills development to improve productivity, thus laying the foundation for export readiness. Research and innovation are also critical to success in the increasingly global marketplace for all companies, regardless of sector. Enterprise Ireland encourages sustained levels of research and development activity through its RTI scheme and research and development initiatives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of IDA Ireland, the agency informs me that figures for 2005 will not be available until later this month. For the period 1998 to 2004, IDA Ireland reports the following jobs created in client companies: 97 jobs in Carlow; 4,768 jobs <Col N="150"/>in Kildare; 634 jobs in Meath; and 3,053 jobs in Wicklow. IDA Ireland is actively promoting all four counties for additional new and expansion investment projects. IDA Ireland has achieved the delivery of a new business and technology park in Carlow; a 290 job project for PFPC Financial Services in Navan which was announced last year; and the attraction of some world class manufacturing companies in Kildare.</P>
        <P>I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional, sustainable jobs and investment for counties Carlow, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Officials from my Department&rsquo;s employment rights section have participated in five meetings of the European Commission&rsquo;s group of national experts on the implementation of the posting of workers directive since October 2003 when the group was first established. The group&rsquo;s mandate is to foster practical co-operation between EU member states regarding implementation of the directive. Further meetings of the group will take place during 2006. The contributions of the officials in question are informed by the provisions and experience of the operation of the directive and relevant Irish legislation providing for the enforcement of employment rights.</P>
        <P>While there have been no formal complaints, from either posted workers or EU member state governments, regarding the treatment of workers posted to work here, nevertheless, my officials reported on the application of the directive in Ireland and, as and when required, completed questionnaires from the European Commission on this subject. In particular, my officials provided information to the group on how the directive would be enforced here by the labour inspectorate.</P><Col N="151"/>
        <P>The group also agreed procedures for enhanced co-operation between member states in relation to the directive.

In addition, a list of national liaison offices and authorities responsible for monitoring the terms and conditions of employment of posted workers is also available in English, French and German on this website. This list facilitates posted workers if they have a complaint about their rights under the directive.</P>
        <P>The expert group has also drawn up a code of conduct on co-operation standards for communications between liaison offices in the member states.

This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff who worked on a number of these investigations or those legal costs borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
        <P>Costs of some &euro;9.3 million were incurred by High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990, &euro;5.8 million in the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and &euro;3.5 million in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. In the case of the Ansbacher inquiry, the High Court proceedings taken by the State to recover the costs of the inquiry were settled out of court for the sum of &euro;1.25 million in favour of the State. In the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, the court ordered that National Irish Bank pay the full costs of the investigation. I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which had borne the costs of the investigation, has recouped the full cost from National Irish Bank. The aggregate recoupment to the State from section 8 investigations was &euro;7.05 million or more than 75% of the total of &euro;9.3 million.

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s unprecedented period of economic prosperity has led to the creation of a modern, advanced European economy typified by all the associated advantages of high incomes, employment growth and rising living standards. Our future prosperity and success is dependent on our ability to develop, attract and retain higher value added operations that are characterised by both high productivity output and higher returns to labour.</P>
        <P>Despite increasing global competitive pressures, the latest quarterly national household survey from the Central Statistics Office shows that the number of persons in employment grew by 96,200 in the year to reach almost 1.99 million in the third quarter of 2005. Moreover, we have seen employment increase in most sectors of the economy, not only construction, with financial and business services showing strong growth. These facts demonstrate that we remain a competitive economy for both foreign and indigenous enterprise and retain a strong capacity to generate and sustain employment while managing the transition to a more knowledge and services oriented economy.</P>
        <P>To further expedite this transition my Department and its agencies are encouraging enterprises to undertake increased levels of investment in research, to make more and better use of technology, to invest in training, and to encourage more innovation across all sectors of the economy. This will help firms produce improved value added products and services. In the longer term this will provide longer lasting and higher quality jobs.</P>
        <P>Sustaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness continues to be a key priority for this Government. It is monitored in particular through the work and advice of the National Competitiveness Council. The Government&rsquo;s response is manifested in numerous ways, most recently as evidenced by the fact that for the third consecutive year it implemented a non-inflationary budget in budget 2006. This displays the Government&rsquo;s prudent fiscal management of the economy at a time of ever increasing global competitiveness pressures.</P>
        <P>In my Department I have assigned more resources and given more powers to the Compe<Col N="154"/>tition Authority. I am currently steering legislation through the Oireachtas to repeal the groceries order. Furthermore, I have established the enterprise advisory group, which is charged with the overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group, ESG. The group&rsquo;s work is progressing well and it will submit its first periodic report to Government on the pace and progress in implementing the ESG&rsquo;s recommendations by June.</P>
        <P>Another fundamental element to safeguarding our competitiveness will be the successful completion of the present partnership talks. These talks will strongly influence our economic progress over the next few years. They will be crucial in setting wage increases at sustainable levels, which will both simultaneously protect our competitiveness and improve our living standards.</P>

	<P>On 21 December 2005, the European Commission adopted new regional aid guidelines for 2007-2013. The regional aid guidelines govern the areas in which member states may grant regional aid, more commonly known as investment aid. Investment aid is intended to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union to redress regional disparities. The guidelines specify rules for the selection of regions which are eligible for regional aid and define the maximum permitted levels of this aid. In line with EU cohesion policy and European Council requests for less and better targeted State aid, the new guidelines refocus regional aid on the most deprived regions of the enlarged Union.</P>
        <P>Under Ireland&rsquo;s current regional aid map, which defines the areas where regional aid may be granted until the end of 2006, all parts of the country currently qualify for some level of aid. Given Ireland&rsquo;s economic performance since the current regional aid map was approved by the European Commission in 1999, it was to be expected that our scope to designate areas for regional aid for 2007-2013 would be significantly reduced. Nevertheless, Ireland has secured entitlement under the new guidelines to maintain regional aid qualification for areas accounting for <Col N="155"/>50% of the country&rsquo;s population for the period 2007-2013 and for a further 25% of population on a transitional basis for 2007-2008.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the guidelines, the Border, midlands and west region &mdash; 26.5% of national population &mdash; will be classed as an &ldquo;economic development region&rdquo; and will continue to qualify for regional aid throughout 2007-2013 on a phasing-out basis. Ireland will be permitted to designate a further 23.5% of population to qualify for regional aid for 2007-2013. The south east sub-region would also qualify on the basis of unemployment criteria specified in the guidelines. The remaining areas which could qualify for designation for 2007-2013 under the 50% population threshold must meet the strict requirement in the guidelines that they are relatively more in need of economic development than other areas on the basis of recognised economic indicators. Following the selection of areas up to the 50% population threshold for 2007-2013, areas representing an additional 25% of population may be designated for 2007-2008.</P>
        <P>No decision on designation has been taken yet, pending detailed analysis of the guidelines and economic indicators for the areas concerned. Member states have to submit proposals for designation to the European Commission for approval. Any area no longer entitled to regional aid would continue to qualify for other forms of State aid, including aid for research and development, aid for SMEs, training aid, employment aid and aid for environmental protection.</P>

	<P>The number of redundancies recorded by the Department for 2005 was 23,156, a reduction of 7.5% over the figure of 25,041 for redundancies in 2004. This downward trend is an indication of the continuing healthy state of the Irish economy. This comes on top of a 2.8% reduction in redundancies in 2004 from the 2003 figure of 25,769.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 182 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The assignment of additional labour inspectors was completed in November 2005 bringing the complement of serving inspectors to 31 officers. That represents almost a doubling of the number of labour inspectors in the past 18 months. In the past week one officer has commenced a career-break and a replacement officer will take up assignment next week.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of employment rights is too often characterised as a discrete function undertaken solely by the labour inspectorate. The reality is that there is a very formidable corpus of legislation that provides for a range of obligations and entitlements for both employers and employees. The employment rights arena is populated by various bodies, for example, the Labour Court, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Rights Commissioner Service to name just a few, each charged with the task of administering that volume of employment law. As always there is scope for improvement but it is no solution to just simply appoint even more labour inspectors.</P>
        <P>The challenge in a rapidly growing economy is to ensure that there is adequate, timely and effective enforcement of compliance with the statutory and other provisions now in place. This was recognised in Sustaining Progress and, arising from commitments in it, the Government has completed reviews of: the employment rights bodies; the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate; and the joint labour committee system. Each of these reviews has been completed and follow-on work is now in train.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the inspectorate, in early 2005 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment circulated a discussion document on the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate to the social partners. That document has been the basis for further consideration by the employment rights compliance group, ERCG, since September 2005. The ERCG, which is made up of representatives of the social partners, including the CIF and SIPTU, together with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance, is now finalising its work in this regard. The outcome of those discussions will inform debate in the context of a new social partnership agreement.</P>
        <P>While the work of the ERCG is not entirely complete it can be indicated that among the key features emerging are options with regard to: a streamlining of access to redress through the existing employment rights bodies thus enabling individuals with the information and facility to <Col N="157"/>more easily vindicate their employment rights and entitlements; a re-orientation of employment rights compliance procedures away from the civil courts; greater emphasis on proper record keeping together with increased transparency regarding pay and the associated information provided to employees on payslips; organisational improvements in the service provided by the employment rights compliance section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment &mdash; including the labour inspectorate and including a regionalised structure; and major investment in education and information dissemination on employment rights obligations and entitlements for both employers and employees.</P>
        <P>Much has been agreed during the course of the ERCG discussions. Final comments from the social partners will be reflected in the finished report and the remaining issues relating to a more effective compliance model and the related organisational aspects &mdash; which may embrace a further strengthening of the labour inspectorate &mdash; have been clearly signalled as being matters for consideration in the forthcoming social partnership discussions.</P>
        <P>The Government is not about reducing the high employment standards that we have attained, rather, it is fully committed to working with the social partners to not only maintain, but build upon and improve the situation of those at work, and, in the context of social partnership, has every confidence that agreement will be reached on all outstanding matters to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.</P>

	<P>I have nothing further to add to my reply of 28 September 2005 when I stated that Enterprise Ireland has primary responsibility for the development of indigenous small and medium enterprises, SMEs, in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors. The decision whether to provide funding to a company is a day-to-day matter for the agency and is not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland offers a range of supports aimed at assisting client companies to expand and compete in the international marketplace. As each company has its own distinctive ambitions, capabilities and needs, Enterprise Ireland delivers a flexible set of solutions tailored to the needs of the individual circumstances of Irish enterprises. Each client company is assigned a <Col N="158"/>development adviser who works with the company in assessing its needs and capabilities, formulating an agreed growth plan and in assisting the company access the range of services and resources it needs to execute that plan.</P>
        <P>The key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s policy is to work with companies which have the potential to develop sustainable export sales and to qualify for support, a company should demonstrate clear potential to do this. Within this general policy context however, each business development plan is considered on its merits. Import substitution by itself is typically considered insufficient to justify the investment of significant resources in funding and support services. Enterprise Ireland believes that companies should also strive to supply such goods into overseas markets. To this end Enterprise Ireland has a range of supports available to assist Irish companies to develop their businesses in a manner that will facilitate them to effectively target and win customers in overseas markets, and will work closely with companies to achieve increased sales and exports in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is important for companies to recognise that Ireland operates within a global market and that supplying the domestic market will be carried out in competition from suppliers in other countries. However, it is well recognised that import substitution can contribute to the viability of a new or growing enterprise and, to that extent, it can be a valuable and welcome constituent part of the company&rsquo;s target market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s sustainable development strategy 2003-2005 is built around four pillars. Three of these relate to reducing the environmental impacts of business in the areas of climate change, competitive sustainability and corporate social responsibility. The fourth pillar addresses the issue of departmental sustainability. I am pleased to report that very significant progress has been made across all four pillars.</P>
        <P>In the area of climate change, for example, my Department had a very significant involvement with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in regard to negotiations at EU and national level on the development and implementation of the EU emissions trading scheme which commenced on 1 January 2005. <Col N="159"/>Through their participation in emissions trading, Irish companies are making a significant contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which will facilitate Ireland in meeting its Kyoto target.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>In the area of competitive sustainability, key activities include my Department&rsquo;s involvement in negotiations on the energy using products directive. This directive, which was adopted in July 2005, establishes a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for energy using products. My Department is also participating in the EU environmental technologies action programme, ETAP. The ETAP is a broad ranging programme which is designed to stimulate the development and uptake of environmental products and services. In addition, my Department supported the work of Sligo County Enterprise Board in regard to improving the competitive sustainability of micro-enterprises. My Department established a multi-stakeholder working group to promote the uptake of environmental management systems, EMSs, by SMEs.</P>
        <P>In the area of corporate social responsibility, CSR, significant progress has been made at both national and EU level. It is widely acknowledged that implementing corporate social responsibility in workplaces requires the closer involvement of employees in dialogue with employers to manage change and develop more sustainable ways of working. The implementation of the national workplace strategy, which was launched by the Taoiseach in March 2005, is being overseen by a high level group chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Killeen. The strategy aims to develop the supports that are required for the development of workplaces that are adaptable, flexible, participatory and highly productive. My Department is also contributing to EU corporate social responsibility policy through continued involvement in an EU high level group. A European Commission communication on corporate social responsibility is expected shortly, and I look forward to considering the details of the document when it is published.</P>
        <P>The fourth pillar of my Department&rsquo;s sustainable development strategy relates to departmental sustainability. Over the period of the strategy there have been many achievements in this area, including the establishment of a departmental green team to promote the incorporation of best environmental practice into the Department&rsquo;s operations and the adoption of a departmental environmental management plan. Some achievements in the area of departmental sustainability include the introduction of paper recycling and ensuring that the Department&rsquo;s new building in Carlow incorporates high environmental standards. In addition, the Department provided training for key departmental and agency staff on the EU strategic environmental assessment.</P><Col N="160"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>One of the commitments in the CSR pillar of the strategy relates to green consumerism, which is about supporting sustainable consumer choices through ensuring the provision of accurate and credible social and environmental information on products and services. In 2000 the European Commission engaged consultants to assist it in identifying specific issues on which guidance for making and assessing green claims, in the light of the international standard ISO 14021, would be useful, and to develop informal guidelines on the subject. This work culminated in December 2000 with the publication of informal guidelines for making and assessing environmental claims. These informal guidelines are available as a support to those wishing to apply good practice in making environmental claims.</P>
        <P>One of the key actions in ETAP, in which my Department is involved at national and EU level, is raising consumer awareness, with a particular emphasis on product labelling in order to ensure consumers have the necessary information to make informed choices. Enterprise Ireland recently participated in an ETAP seminar specifically targeted at raising business and consumer awareness of environmental products and services. Another way in which my Department is continuing to promote green consumerism is by promoting the uptake of environmental management systems, EMSs, by SMEs through a multi-stakeholder working group which it has established. EMSs facilitate more informed consumer choice, as the EMS is a clear demonstration of a company&rsquo;s commitment to reducing its environmental impact.</P>
        <P>I should also mention that the new National Consumer Agency, whose establishment has been approved by Government, will have specific statutory functions in the area of consumer education, awareness, information and advice to help ensure that consumers are sufficiently empowered to make informed choices about the goods and services they buy and use in their day to day lives.</P>
        <P>I consider the significant progress made over the period of the strategy has resulted in my Department addressing the challenges posed by sustainable ways of doing business, while maximising the business and competitiveness opportunities presented.</P>

	<P>The Health and Safety Authority has responsibility for enforcement of occupational safety and health law as set out in the Safety, <Col N="161"/>Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. Matters relating to enforcement of the Act are consequently the responsibility of the authority.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the Health and Safety Authority was granted a High Court order in accordance with section 71 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 prohibiting work on a construction site in Dungarvan, County Waterford on 24 January 2006.

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Following the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Martin, on 12 April last, there are now 31 inspector posts sanctioned for the labour inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of inspector personnel in the past 18 months and is indicative of a determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation. While the additional officers have been appointed and have been serving since late last year a vacancy has arisen in the past week. An application for a career break from one of the longer-serving inspectors was approved and became effective on 26 January. I expect that the vacancy will be filled next week.</P>
        <P>The officers will concentrate on those employment sectors that have traditionally required considerable attention from the inspectorate. These are the services sectors covered by employment regulation orders such as, hospitality, cleaning and agricultural work. It is notable that many migrant workers are employed in these sectors at present.</P>
        <P>The latest CSO statistics indicate that currently the number of people in employment is now more than 2 million. Accordingly, it might be characterised that for every inspector there are about 65,000 persons in employment. However, such an analysis is highly misleading since significant groups of people, substantial in number within <Col N="162"/>that global figure, are securely in receipt of pay and conditions that exceed the statutory minimums provided for in employment rights legislation.</P>
        <P>It has to be noted also, that in addition to the remit of the labour inspectorate, there is a wide corpus of employment rights legislation administered by various other State organisations and services. These include, for example, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Labour Court, the Rights Commissioner Service and the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>Immediately within the Department there is also, for example, the redundancy and insolvency sections together with the employment rights compliance section, ERCS. The latter comprises three distinct but inter-related business units, that is, the labour inspectorate, the employment rights information unit and a further separate unit that administers the referral of cases for prosecution and legal enforcement of orders. A complement of staff, who number in excess of 150 people, administer the various functions that are the remits of these bodies and services.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to the promotion of lifelong learning. In today&rsquo;s rapidly changing world, we all must be prepared to adapt our skills. As the majority of the 2020 workforce are already working today, the training of those in employment is particularly important.</P>
        <P>The primary responsibility for training rests with employers and individuals. However, the State funds training for particular groups where necessary, especially for the low skilled and the vulnerable. Increased funds have been provided in recent years to a number of programmes to support the one step up initiative through the training of those in employment. These programmes include the F&Aacute;S in-employment training initiatives, the skillnets training networks and accel programmes and the Enterprise Ireland in-company training programme.</P>
        <P>Any discussion of paid learning leave must acknowledge the State&rsquo;s role in the training of those in employment. I am aware that ICTU, in a report published last June, proposed the introduction of paid learning leave. As that document implicitly acknowledged, progress on this issue will require consensus between Government, employers and trade unions.</P>

        <P>In a second report to the European Commission in January 2005, the Department provided a detailed account of the main provisions of Irish legislation which applies to posted workers. All employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in the State applies to posted workers in the same way as it applies to Irish workers. The report covered issues such as: the definition of a &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in Ireland&rsquo;s employee protection legislation; how Article 3(1) of the directive regarding the rights of posted workers was implemented; national case law, if any, in relation to posted workers; collective agreements giving effect to Article 3(1); co-operation procedures between member states; penalties for failure to comply with the legislation implementing the directive; and statistics on posted workers.</P>
        <P>The European Commission did not require member state governments to consult their national social partners on the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s response but this response was informed by both direct experience and ongoing contacts with the social partners regarding the functioning of the labour market and compliance with employment legislation.</P>

	<P>I am very pleased with the positive conclusions of the report referred to by the Deputy, which I launched in December. This evaluation report, Science Foundation Ireland The First Years 2001-2005, which was commissioned by Forf&aacute;s, is the culmination of a substantial evaluation process carried out by an international panel led by Professor Richard Brook, director of the Leverhulme Trust in London.</P><Col N="164"/>
        <P>While the panel indicates in the report that it is early in the life of SFI to assess the long-term cultural and economic impact of the research it supports, overall, it endorses the establishment and strategic direction of SFI and I welcome this endorsement. The panel found that SFI has been a positive driving force for change in the Irish research system in recent years and that impressive progress towards developing a world-class capability in biotechnology and ICT has been achieved in a short time. The report provides strong confirmation both of the need for SFI and of the contribution it has made, and continues to make, to strengthening our national research system, which is a fundamental building block for the knowledge economy to which we aspire.</P>
        <P>The panel has made a number of recommendations on research excellence, sustainability of research funding, coherence and co-ordination by research funding agencies, commercialisation of research and some operational issues. SFI will work on the implementation of these recommendations together with my Department and other agencies as appropriate. In addition, a number of these issues will be addressed in the context of the strategy on science, technology and innovation 2006-2013, which I am currently finalising and which I will bring to Government in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140, 327 and 334 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth and development is built, to a significant degree, upon the export activities of Irish based companies. The global economy, which Ireland has fully embraced for the betterment of all export orientated firms and <Col N="165"/>their employees, offers immense opportunities for Irish companies with a small domestic market.</P>
        <P>While considerable effort is devoted to developing and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s traditional existing markets for exports, with northern Europe remaining our biggest market, Irish companies have achieved notable success in opening up new markets in recent years. From a position of 75% of Irish exports going to the UK in 1960, we have now reached a point where the EU now accounts for 62% of our exports with only 18% of exports going to the UK. Since last year, the US has replaced the UK as our leading export market and now accounts for about 20% of Irish exports. For example, Asia, a relatively new market for Irish companies, shows significant promise for sustained future growth. Pursuing the targets set out in the Government&rsquo;s Asia strategy is a priority for the next five years. We have therefore actively supported Irish enterprises in exploiting the prospects offered by the Asian market as well as by existing export markets and newer markets such as central and eastern Europe which will also be important for future growth.</P>
        <P>The ability of Irish companies to successfully market and sell overseas is critical for the success of the Irish economy, particularly in the rapidly evolving international marketplace. In this connection, there has been a very creditable performance on the part of Irish exporters in a difficult trading environment against the background of the current global economic slowdown, in particular the slow growth in the major European economies of France, Germany and Italy and fluctuations in exchange rates of the euro against the US dollar and the pound sterling.</P>
        <P>To further support Irish exporters in competing with competitors on world markets, my Department and its agencies are encouraging our enterprises to undertake increased levels of investment in research, to use more technology in product development and to encourage more innovation across all sectors of the economy. This will help firms produce improved value added products and services. In the longer term this will provide longer lasting and higher quality jobs.</P>
        <P>I and my departmental colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin, have been active in leading trade <Col N="166"/>missions, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, to a range of markets. Last month a major trade mission to India took place, led by the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>In relation to recent trends in trade, the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show that exports increased by 7% in November 2005 relative to October 2005 and imports decreased by 9% in the same period. In addition, the export figure for November 2005 was 11% higher than the corresponding period for the same month in 2004. Strong export growth has taken place in 2005 across a number of key indigenous industry sectors including software and financial services, life-sciences and food, with the construction and engineering sectors maintaining performance levels.</P>

	<P>There are currently a total of 26 directives due to be transposed by this Department. Of these, ten are overdue for transposition and are detailed as follows. Eight directives require to be transposed before the end of 2006 and a further eight in 2007 and subsequent years.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to provide definitive information on infringement proceedings prior to 2001. However, since 2001, my Department has received 26 notifications &mdash; additional to the five extant notifications in the following table &mdash; from the Commission in respect of the non-transposition of EU directives. All the directives covered by the 26 notifications have been transposed and the infringement proceedings have been satisfactorily resolved.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to accord a high priority to the transposition of directives and makes every effort to transpose directives in time to meet the deadline given for transposition. </P><Col N="165"/>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 158, 171 and 181 together.</P>
        <P>Figures published by the Health and Safety Authority show that 71 work-related deaths were reported to it in 2005 compared to 50 in 2004. I extend my sympathy to all the families of those involved and affected by the workplace fatalities. Unfortunately, for 2005, the same industry sectors, construction and agriculture, remained the most dangerous. There were 23 construction-related fatalities in 2005 compared to 16 in 2004 and 17 in 2003. Seventeen people died in the agricultural sector in 2005 compared to 13 in 2004 and 19 in 2003. Of the 17 deaths in the agricultural sector, seven involved people over 65 years of age. There were two child fatalities in the sector in 2005. To date, a total of 7,901 non-fatal accidents, resulting in absence of more than three days from normal work, was reported to the authority across all sectors in 2005. Of these 1,612 related to the construction sector.</P>
        <P>A total of nine non-national worker fatalities occurred in Ireland in 2005, of which six were from other EU member states and three from other countries. Five of the worker fatalities occurred in construction, two in manufacturing industry and two in wholesale-retail and other services.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority has expressed concern over the number of deaths involving non-<Col N="170"/>nationals in 2005 and I agree that this concern is well founded and the number of fatalities involving non-nationals is out of proportion to their representation in the workforce.</P>
        <P>The following table shows the number of fatalities by sector over the past three years. The rate of deaths and injuries in Irish workplaces is unacceptable and a range of approaches is necessary to secure and maintain a significant improvement. There are huge responsibilities on all parties in the workplace and the issue of safety can only be corrected by dedicated efforts by all those involved in day to day operations. I repeat my appeal to all parties to do more to promote awareness of the need for a safe work environment which has benefits for workers, employers and for society generally and which will engender a safety culture.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the drafting of new Safety, Health and Welfare (Construction) Regulations, following consideration of submissions received on foot of the public consultation process, are at an advanced stage. Also, drafting of new Safety, Health and Welfare (General Application) Regulations, designed to revoke and replace in a single text the remaining provisions of the General Application Regulations 1993, as well as seven full sets of other regulations made under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, together with certain other provisions are well advanced. I expect to be in a position to sign both sets of these new regulations into force within the next few months.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s work programme for this year includes prioritising the high risk sectors of construction, agriculture and mines and quarries, as well as the health services, local authorities and process industries. Key actions in these sectors in 2006 will include: a major national road show which will visit a minimum of 5,000 construction workers; the development of a farm &ldquo;safety village&rdquo; at the World Ploughing Championships; the publication of three codes of practice tailored to those employing three or fewer in the agriculture, quarrying, and construction sectors; an effective inspection programme targeting key risks; a series of construction briefings targeting managers and designers on the new construction regulations including information on vibration, noise, work at height, underground services, roof work and cranes; and research into the issues involved in the employment of non-English speaking workers.</P>
        <P>In relation to the construction sector specifically, the authority in 2006 is committed to carrying out a focused programme of 7,500 construction site inspections covering appointment of duty-holders and assignment of responsibilities, safety and health plans and safety statements, work at heights, reversing vehicle safety, welfare arrangements, training arrangements and slips, trips and falls. </P><Col N="171"/>

        <Quest>the steps he intends to take to reduce the level of unemployment among people with disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed to addressing the needs of those with disabilities. In particular, we are committed to removing the obstacles which make it difficult for people with disabilities to participate in the labour market.</P>
        <P>We have already done a great deal in this area. Under the Government&rsquo;s mainstreaming policy, my Department through F&Aacute;S is seeking to increase the participation of disabled workers through a three-pronged approach involving: first, facilitating progression into sustainable employment through skills development; second, stimulating awareness among employers of the contribution that disabled people can make and encouraging them to recruit them; and, third, providing specific employment supports for disabled people and employers.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities now benefit from the full range of F&Aacute;S training programmes and services. Since 2002 F&Aacute;S has realised approximately 29,000 placements of people with disabilities in employment, training and other options. Since 2002 the F&Aacute;S budget for vocational training and employment for people with disabilities increased from &euro;54 million to &euro;64 million in 2005.</P><Col N="172"/>
        <P>F&Aacute;S provides an extensive range of schemes and grants specifically to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector. These include: the workplace or equipment adaptation grant; the employee retention grant scheme; the job interview interpreter grant; and the personal reader grant.</P>
        <P>In addition, last year I launched a new wage subsidy scheme. F&Aacute;S administers the scheme. It offers financial support to employers outside the public sector to encourage them to employ disabled people. Grants varying between &euro;7,650 and &euro;9,500 are indefinitely available for each person recruited into employment.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing a multi-annual sectoral plan. The primary objective of this plan will be to ensure that those disabled people who aspire to avail of vocational training and employment options are given those opportunities, with the necessary financial and other supports. In formulating our plan, extensive consultations are under way and the viewpoints of all will be given careful consideration. We will also give close attention to the level of success of State supports provided to date and the need to adapt them as necessary.</P>

        <Quest>the investigation his Department has carried out into reports highlighted in the media of the treatment and subsequent dismissal of 14 female mushroom pickers from Latvia and Lithuania employed in County Cavan, who claimed that they had been required to work for an average of &euro;250 per week for a working week of between 80 and 100 hours and had also been asked to work on Christmas day; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The labour inspectorate of the Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P>Employment regulation orders govern the wages and employment conditions of workers who are employed in the mushroom industry, unless they are already covered by the terms of a registered employment agreement, pursuant to the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate has been in contact with the individuals who carried out work at the premises over a number of months and several statements have been recorded. At present, the inspectorate is clarifying the position as to the employer and employee relationship that may exist in respect of the individuals mentioned and the current owner-operator of the facility.</P><Col N="174"/>
        <P>The issues arising are complex and to some extent may be further compounded by the fact that the current operator is possibly not resident in the State. The inspectorate is actively pursuing the case and will be focused on trying to secure appropriate redress for the people concerned once the facts, as distinct from media reports, are satisfactorily established. Should the question of prosecution arise it will be considered at the appropriate time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The agreement reached in Hong Kong provides for a continuation of negotiations across the full spectrum of areas within the Doha Development Agenda, with a recommendation of a deadline of concluding the negotiations successfully in 2006.</P>
        <P>The Hong Kong ministerial meeting progressed important objectives including that of agreeing a package of measures of benefit, in particular, to least developed countries, as well as making progress on other aspects of the DDA negotiations, including in agriculture. An important achievement in Hong Kong was the agreement on the development package, including 97% Everything But Arms coverage, progress on cotton subsidies and on Aid for Trade. In agriculture, WTO members agreed to the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect to be completed by the end of 2013.</P>
        <P>Ireland, as with other EU member states, would have liked to have seen more progress in reaching agreement on lowering tariffs and trade barriers in the areas of industrial goods and services. EU Ministers, in their conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, in Hong Kong, shared the assessment of Commissioners Mandelson and Fischer Boel that, despite certain deficiencies and lack of ambitious progress on various issues, the overall outcome was acceptable.</P>
        <P>Ireland is hopeful that the further negotiations, over the coming year, can achieve greater negotiating success through greater market access in areas of interest for Irish industrial goods and services exporters, and that the development objective of the negotiations can be fully met. Ireland, as with other EU member states, will work towards the achievement of an ambitious and balanced overall outcome to the DDA negotiations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including Mayo, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day to day operational matter for the agency. While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>The agency has specifically assured me it is actively marketing and promoting the linked hub towns of Ballina, Castlebar and Westport for new greenfield investment. However the attraction of FDI to regional locations such as Mayo is not an easy task, with clients looking at Ireland often only willing to consider larger centres that have the scale, infrastructure and services capable of sustaining their investment.</P>
        <P>In line with the national spatial strategy, a key goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. In this regard IDA Ireland is seeking to promote all regions and works closely with a range of local bodies including the county development boards, the local authorities, utility providers, third level institutes, private sector property solution providers etc., with a view to encouraging infrastructure development and expanding the number of alternative locations within Ireland that overseas investors will consider.</P>
        <P>In the west region the agency is investing significantly in the development of world class business and technology parks at a number of towns throughout Mayo. The goal is to ensure that these locations have the appropriate property solutions, tailored to specific key sectoral targets, to attract inward investments. Specifically in Ballina, IDA Ireland is at an advanced stage in the acquisition of 27 acres of land on the Sligo Road with a view to developing a high quality business and technology park.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2004, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 22 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Mayo employing 3,213 <Col N="176"/>people. The agency is actively working with these clients with a view to encouraging them to grow and expand.</P>
        <P>I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland in the county together with the ongoing commitment by Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for County Mayo.</P>

        <Quest>the number of inspections carried out by the labour inspectorate and the number of prosecutions initiated by the inspectorate in respect of the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005; his plans to increase this number during 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of workplace inspections-visits undertaken by the labour inspectorate, during and after normal business hours, and prosecutions initiated in respect of the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 is set out in the following tabular statement. It should be noted that substantial and multifaceted investigations appear in the 2005 figures as one unit.</P>
        <P>The primary function of the labour inspectorate is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including payment of any arrears due to employees. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and seek redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Successful prosecution can be dependent on adequate support from witnesses.</P>
        <P>The number of inspector posts in the labour inspectorate of the Department is 31. The assignment of previously announced additional labour inspectors was completed in November 2005. That brought the complement of serving inspectors to 31 officers. That increase represents almost a doubling of inspector personnel in the past 18 months and is indicative of a determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the new round of social partnership talks will embrace consideration of further resourcing of the labour inspectorate together with options to enhance the effectiveness of our overall employment rights compliance regime.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Since adoption of the WTO July 2004 Framework Agreement, WTO members have focused their attention on non-tariff barriers, NTBs, in recognition of the fact that they are an integral and important part of the non-agricultural market access, NAMA, negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda.</P>
        <P>The recent Sixth World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference, in Hong Kong, noted that the WTO NAMA Negotiating Group, in Geneva, has made progress in the identification, categorisation and examination of notified NTBs. It also noted that WTO members are developing bilateral, vertical and horizontal approaches to the NTB negotiations, and that some of the NTBs are addressed in other fora including other negotiating groups. These NTB negotiations would include those in respect of electronic and other industrial products.</P>

	<P>The Health and Safety Authority, the body charged with overall responsibility for administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health, is responsible for the implementation of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. This legislation deals with occupational safety, health and welfare.</P>
        <P>The authority has 164 staff involved in inspection, investigation and enforcement of health and safety legislation and it works to an ambitious planned work programme. For 2006 the authority has a budget of &euro;20.598 million and in the context of the overall allocation of resources I am confident the authority can achieve the objectives in its programme.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of the Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland. <Col N="178"/>Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are 31 inspectors working in the labour inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of inspector personnel in the past 18 months and is indicative of a determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation.</P>

	<P>Support for job creation and investment in individual counties and regions is a day to day operational matter for the development agencies as part of their responsibility under the Industrial Development Acts. While I may give general policy directives to the agencies I am precluded under the Industrial Developments Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland, the agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland, is actively marketing the east Cork area which includes locations such as Youghal, Little Island, Carrigtwohill, Midleton, Carrigaline and Ringaskiddy to potential investors on an ongoing basis. I am informed that every effort is being made to secure further advanced knowledge based industries for Youghal. The availability of a 4 hectare site with two high quality manufacturing facilities is a valuable asset in this regard. Existing FDI companies in Youghal include Avery Dennison, Tytex, and Artesyn Technologies.</P>
        <P>Since 2003 more than 60% of all new investments announced in Cork city and county have been based in the east Cork area. The recent Amgen announcement of 1,100 new jobs at an &euro;820 million facility at Carrigtohill, which is only 20 miles from Youghal, is a significant achievement by IDA Ireland, as it involves a major global project which has chosen east Cork as its development location.</P>
        <P>From an inward investment perspective, IDA Ireland believes that Youghal, due to its proximity to the greater Cork area, benefits considerably from ongoing developments in the city and county. Since 1993 direct employment in IDA supported companies in Cork city and county has grown by more than 80%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enterprise Ireland, which is the agency with prime responsibility for the development of indigenous industries, is working closely with <Col N="179"/>community groups in the towns of east Cork including Youghal, to foster further embryonic enterprise and to encourage young graduates to set up businesses in their own localities. In association with the South Cork Enterprise Board, the agency facilitated and encouraged the coming together of the group Enterprise Youghal, comprising representatives of the Youghal Chamber of Commerce, the town council and other interested parties, to drive and encourage an enterprise culture within the town.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has set up a meeting with the Enterprise Youghal group and the South Cork County Enterprise Board, SCCEB, scheduled for 8 February 2006 to discuss the prospect of an application by the group for Enterprise Ireland assistance under the recently announced community enterprise scheme for the provision of community based incubator units which would stimulate business start-ups in the town.</P>
        <P>The SCCEB, was established in 1993 to provide support to the south Cork area for small businesses with ten employees or fewer. Since its inception SCCEB has approved a total of &euro;175,734 to 12 projects in the Youghal region in the past two years.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of east Cork, including those living in Youghal.</P>

	<P>Section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 transposed the posting of workers directive into Irish law. Section 20 provides that, for the avoidance of doubt, all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in the State applies to posted workers within the meaning of the directive in the same way as it applies to Irish workers. Posted workers are workers who are sent to another country on a temporary basis by an employer.</P>
        <P>The enactments that regulate the rights guaranteed to posted workers by Directive 96/71/EC include: Employment Agency Act 1971; Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004; Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996; Organisation of Working Time Act 1997; Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004; National Minimum Wage Act 2000; and Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to provide evidence regarding the impact on wage levels of the increase in new European accession states&rsquo; nationals working here. This is because it is not possible to conclusively isolate this impact from that of the various other factors which affect wage levels.</P>
        <P>It is true that a significant number of EU-10 nationals have joined our labour force since accession in May 2004. We know that since May 2004 more than 160,000 PPS numbers have been issued to them. Based on Revenue Commissioners data, it is estimated that about 70% of these people have employment details and therefore worked here at some stage, although many of them may have returned home in the meantime.</P>
        <P>Preliminary indications regarding whether the participation of these EU-10 nationals has had a significant impact on overall wage levels, or on unemployment rates here, are that in overall terms it has not. Unemployment in Ireland remains at very low levels and has averaged 4.3% over the past year, the lowest in the European Union. In the year to the third quarter of 2005, employment grew by 5.1%, in other words, an additional 96,000 jobs were created, of which approximately 40,000 were taken up by non-nationals. In general, non-national workers appear to be filling jobs in those sectors which are experiencing strong jobs growth.</P>
        <P>Most sectors of the economy in which a high proportion of EU-10 nationals are working are also showing fairly robust levels of earnings growth. For example, many EU-nationals are working in the construction sector and the latest <Col N="182"/>figures for that sector show fairly strong annual wage growth to the third quarter of 2005 of 6.8%.</P>
        <P>I am advised that up until 30 April 2006 it is open to us to restrict access to the labour market of the nationals of new member states. Thereafter, in the period to 30 April 2011, the approval of the European Commission would be necessary to impose restrictions, which would have to be justified by reference to a threat of serious disturbance to the Irish labour market.</P>
        <P>However, in the context of our current robust employment position, I have no plans to change current policy regarding the access of EU-10 nationals to our labour market. These workers have already made a positive contribution to our economy and have participated significantly in the development of our infrastructure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The labour inspectorate of the Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. To effectively exercise their powers when checking or pursuing possible non-compliance with employment rights obligations, inspectors require clarity around the employer-employee relationship in order that relevant provisions of the legislation can be applied. The phenomenon of bogus self-employment-bogus sub-contracting can frustrate that process.</P>
        <P>In the construction industry, the recent significant Labour Court decision relating to the registered employment agreement in this area is notable. In this case, the employer maintained that two workers were employed as self-employed sub-contractors and accordingly not covered by the Construction Industry REA. The court concluded in this case that the workers were covered by the REA. In its consideration of the matter the Labour Court was guided by a 2005 High Court case, which found that the definition of a &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the 1990 Industrial Relations Act is wide enough to include an individual sub-contractor.</P>
        <P>The imminent discussions on a new social partnership agreement will include issues relating to a more effective compliance model and the related organisational aspects that might arise as a consequence. As a particular topic it is likely that the question of bogus self-employment-bogus sub-contracting will be considered in that context.</P>
        <P>The Government is not about reducing the high employment standards that we have <Col N="183"/>attained, rather, it is fully committed to working with the social partners to not only maintain but build upon and improve the situation of those at work, and, in the context of social partnership, it has every confidence that agreement will be reached on all outstanding matters to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 172 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of recent reports regarding so-called gifting schemes operating in Cork and Kerry. Under these schemes people pay sometimes large sums of money to other people in the expectation of other people giving them multiples of the original amount. The Pyramid Selling Act 1980, which prohibits people from inducing others to participate in pyramid selling schemes, applies to goods and services but there is a legal doubt as to whether this type of transaction is covered under the Act.</P>
        <P>Ultimately it is for the courts to determine the law in this matter. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the enforcing authority for the Act.</P>
        <P>I intend examining this issue in the context of the transposition of the unfair commercial practices directive, 2005/29/EC. The unfair commercial practices directive, which was adopted by the Council in May 2005, has as its aim increased protection for the consumer. The directive will outlaw certain practices. Specifically, the practice of &ldquo;establishing, operating or promoting a pyramid promotional scheme where a consumer gives consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation that is derived primarily from the introduction of other consumers into the scheme rather than from the sale or consumption of products&rdquo; will be banned. I will ensure that the Pyramid Selling Act 1980 will be reviewed in the context of the transposition of the unfair commercial practices directive.</P>
        <P>I urge people to be vigilant in how they use their money. People should reflect on whether it is realistic to expect other people to give them large sums of money for nothing.</P>

	<P>The issues of job creation and retention in enterprise development agency supported companies is a day-to-day matter for the agencies and not one in which I am directly involved. I assume the question refers to client companies of the enterprise development agencies.</P>
        <P>In recent years Irish manufacturing firms, particularly in the more traditional sectors, have operated against a backdrop of an increasingly competitive international environment. Despite these pressures, total unemployment in Ireland remains relatively low at 4.3% and economic growth is estimated at 4.8% for 2005.</P>
        <P>A total of 4,710 people are employed in 194 client companies of Enterprise Ireland in County Wicklow. Provisional figures for 2005 indicate that in County Wicklow, 426 jobs were created and 855 jobs were lost resulting in a net loss of 429 jobs. A total of 2,547 people are employed in 88 client companies of Enterprise Ireland in County Carlow. Provisional figures for 2005 indicate that in County Carlow, 204 jobs were created and 312 jobs were lost resulting in a net loss of 108.</P><Col N="185"/>
        <P>In County Wicklow, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding support of more than &euro;7.3 million and paid more than &euro;7.8 million to client companies in the past three years. Enterprise Ireland has also approved funding of more than &euro;1.5 million in support of community enterprise centres in Arklow and Wicklow town. Arklow Community Enterprise Centre opened in April 2005. In County Carlow, in the past three years, Enterprise Ireland approved support of more than &euro;5.3 million and made payments of more than &euro;3.5 million for manufacturing industry in the county. Enterprise Ireland assisted the establishment of Carlow Community Enterprise Centre, which opened in December 2004 and has also approved &euro;1.42 million for the construction of a campus innovation centre at Carlow Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P>The county enterprise boards, CEBs, develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity throughout their regions. Carlow County Enterprise Board reports that in 2005 its clients created 60 jobs and lost ten jobs resulting in a net increase of 50 jobs.

        <P Just="Left">IDA employment figures for 2005 will be available at the end of February 2006. It is actively working with client companies in Carlow to encourage them to grow and expand their range of activities. The role of third level colleges such as Carlow Institute of Technology and St. Patrick&rsquo;s College is critical to ensuring that Carlow and the region develops its educational and research capability to support existing and new investment. IDA Ireland is committed to the development of County Carlow and is actively promoting Carlow town for new foreign investment in international services and high value manufacturing activities. IDA Ireland has invested almost &euro;11.5 million to date in developing the Carlow business and technology park on the Dublin Road. IDA Ireland is already actively marketing the building and park through its network of overseas offices. For County Wicklow, IDA Ireland reports that Takeda Pharmaceutical&rsquo;s &mdash; Japan &mdash; new expansion facility at IDA Ireland Bray business park is almost complete which will result in an increase of 90 jobs.

The Deputy will be aware that a Bill to repeal the order in its entirety and to amend the Competition Acts to strengthen the prohibitions in relation to resale price maintenance, unfair discrimination and &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; in the grocery trade is progressing through the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the other recommendations of the CSG, a number of the recommendations relating to my Department have already been implemented. For example, the fines for breaching consumer protection laws have recently been significantly increased, as recommended by the CSG, the fundamental review of the existing code of consumer protection law, as recommended by the CSG, is already under way and additional resources have been dedicated by my Department to this task.</P>
        <P>The CSG report contains more than 30 separate recommendations involving a variety of different of Departments and agencies whose activities directly impact upon the interests of consumers. Given the scope of the CSG&rsquo;s report, a high level interdepartmental committee was established to examine and prepare a detailed plan for the implementation of the recommendations. The committee&rsquo;s report, which was endorsed by the Government, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>I trust the Deputy can see that considerable progress has been made in progressing the recommendations of the CSG since the publication of its report. I am determined that this progress con<Col N="187"/>tinues throughout the coming year and I am confident that together with the interim board of the NCA, progress will continue to be made to the benefit of consumers.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the survey to which the Deputy refers. It was undertaken by assessing the contents of websites of various recruitment organisations and counting the IT vacancies being advertised at that time. The results attest to the overall buoyancy of the economy and, in particular, the upturn in the ICT sector since 2001.</P>
        <P>The expert group of future skills needs advises Government on skills and labour supply issues for the enterprise sector. It carried out work in 2005 that pointed to skills shortages in a number of IT occupations. These include computer programmers, analysts and software engineers. While there does not appear to be a shortage at present among electronic and electrical engineers, the upturn in IT activity means that available skilled manpower is in greater demand than heretofore.</P>
        <P>The expert group on future skills needs is closely monitoring the supply of graduates from the third level education system. The declining number of students opting to study ICT related subjects at third level, largely due to mistaken perceptions among students and their parents that the IT industry is not a good career choice, is of concern. Those perceptions are no longer valid in the light of current labour market manpower needs.</P>
        <P>Last October, the expert group on future skills needs convened a meeting of key stakeholders, including Discover Science &amp; Engineering, Engineers Ireland, ICT Ireland, the Irish Computer Society, the Higher Education Authority and IDA Ireland. The objective was to devise a co-ordinated action plan to reverse these mistaken perceptions and the consequential fall-off in students undertaking ICT related subjects.</P>
        <P>All these organisations have since then been actively promoting technology-based courses in the run-up to the recent CAO applications deadline. A longer-term awareness campaign to highlight the opportunities now available to graduates with third level qualifications in technological disciplines is in development. It will be launched during 2006. In summary, I am aware of the emerging manpower problems in this sector and we are taking action to address them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation governing rates of pay within the tourism sector depends on the nature of that work. The wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the hotel and restaurant business are in most instances governed by employment regulation orders made pursuant to the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004.</P>
        <P>The hotels employment regulation order applies to workers employed in hotels anywhere throughout the State except the county borough of Cork and areas known, until 1 January 1994, as the county borough of Dublin and the borough of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
        <P>Wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the catering industry are governed by two catering employment regulation orders, one of which covers workers employed in catering establishments in the areas known, until 1 January 1994, as the county borough of Dublin and the borough of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and the other employment regulation order which covers catering establishments outside that area. In the area of pay and conditions, for all other employees in the sector the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 apply.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of the Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P>Since November 2005 the number of labour inspectors assigned and serving has been increased to 31 officers. As part of the programme of work that is being implemented to train the new inspectors, their schedule includes a focus on national minimum wage compliance during February. In addition to the new inspectors, a number of experienced officers will be participating in this exercise also to provide support and guidance as well as undertaking inspections themselves.</P>
        <P>It should be noted also that in many cases, employment rights legislation has provisions whereby workers who believe that they have been denied their entitlements or otherwise unfairly treated can, as an alternative to dealing with the labour inspectorate, take the matter <Col N="189"/>before a commissioner in the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
        <P>I urge anyone who has specific evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>

	<P>The labour inspectorate of the Department has been in contact with relevant colleagues in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Health and Safety Authority. An inspector has interviewed the boat owner and two of the Latvian people who were gathering the shellfish. It has not been possible to establish any detail of an employment relationship and the Latvian interviewees made no complaint.</P>
        <P>The Latvian Embassy has been contacted in the matter to ascertain if any complaints had been received there in connection with the incident. It appears that there have not been any complaints received. The embassy was assured that any complaints would be investigated and advised that in the event an employment relationship was established, the inspectorate would undertake a full inspection of relevant employment records and pursue any non-compliance with legislation within its remit.</P>
        <P>In the absence of evidence of non-compliance with employment legislation the labour inspectorate does not propose referring the matter to the prosecution unit of the Department. In the event that new information comes to light, the inspectorate will consider what further action, if any, is appropriate.</P>

	<P>Sixteen investigations into company law matters were initiated by my predecessor in the period since 1997. In three cases, the High Court appointed, on an application by the Minister, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published and referred to the DPP.</P>
        <P>The inspectors appointed to National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited presented their report to the High Court on 12 July 2004. The report was subsequently published. The court ordered that a copy of the report be referred to several relevant authorities, including the DPP. In 2005, the Director of Corporate Enforcement initiated proceedings in the High Court under section 160(2) of the Companies Act 1990, as amended, seeking the disqualification of nine persons against whom adverse comment was made by the inspectors. I note that last October the High Court granted a disqualification order against one of the nine persons. The proceedings against the other eight remain before the court.</P>
        <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this was referred to the DPP. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this was referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors who undertook the section 8 investigation into that company.</P>
        <P>Eleven investigations were initiated by the Minister under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were referred to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and a further report was completed in March 2003. Both reports have been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Two of the 11 section 19 investigations were held up in legal appeals. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>In relation to the three remaining section 19 investigations, the current position is that in June 2005 I directed the authorised officer to place at the disposal of relevant public authorities, including tribunals, whatever information and assist<Col N="191"/>ance arising from his investigative work was required by those authorities for the purpose of the performance of their statutory functions. This process is continuing and will be completed as soon as possible. My objective in giving this direction is to achieve the earliest possible pursuit by the appropriate authorities of any matter which may require action by them.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 169 together.</P>
        <P>This was by far the largest trade mission from Ireland to have ever visited India, and, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s Asia strategy, it was an important step in a structured programme designed to bring Ireland and India closer together. The mission to India visited three key business centres &mdash; Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai. A total of 85 Irish companies, industry associations and organisations participated and a total of 120 business executives from these bodies travelled as delegates. The companies were from a broad range of sectors, from software and IT, through industrial products and services and education services to food and beverages. Significantly, 12 companies from Northern Ireland also participated and representatives from Invest Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry were also present.</P>
        <P>The companies on the mission participated in more than 500 business meetings in the three cities. Most of the companies involved were making their first visit to India and Enterprise Ireland undertook to set up and manage individual itineraries for more than 50 of the Irish companies. In addition to setting up individual schedules, Enterprise Ireland organised three major networking lunches, one in each city. A total of 700 people attended these lunch events. Also, a number of group meetings were set up with leading Indian companies to give EI client companies access to high level connections within these companies, which they can later follow up. Separate events were organised by Enterprise Ireland for the education sector participants in Bangalore and in Delhi.</P>
        <P>Eight Enterprise Ireland client companies signed contracts during the mission and 20 edu<Col N="192"/>cation sector partnership contracts, between Irish higher education institutions and their local equivalents, were also signed. It is estimated that these partnerships and contracts will generate an increase in revenue from India of the order of &euro;35 million over the next three years. In addition, three of the Northern Ireland companies signed contracts or partnerships with Indian businesses.</P>
        <P>A number of other stakeholders used the mission to initiate partnerships with their opposite numbers and clients. Examples include the signature of various agreements between the Irish Software Association, the Irish Biotech Association and the Irish Exporters Association, with their counterpart organisations in India.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and I also used the mission to meet privately with a number of senior business leaders and it is likely that some of these executives will make exploratory business visits to Ireland in the coming months. During the mission, the Taoiseach announced that it had been decided that Enterprise Ireland is to establish an office in India to better service the needs of Irish companies in that market. I signed a bilateral science and technology co-operation agreement on behalf of my Department with the Indian Minister for Science and Technology. In addition, Science Foundation Ireland signed an agreement with the Indian Science Academy.</P>

	<P>I note the resolution of the European Parliament of 15 January 2004 on the implementation of the posting of workers directive. The resolution makes a number of proposals which are, in the main, matters for the European Commission, under its right of initiative, to address in the first instance.</P>
        <P>Posted workers are workers who are sent to another country on a temporary basis by an employer. While Ireland has not had any complaints in respect of persons sent here temporarily by their employers, should the European Commission come forward with any concrete proposals in the area, such as an amending directive, for consideration by the Council of Ministers, Ireland will play a constructive role. Our aim will be to ensure that any agreement reached will be of practical benefit to posted workers throughout the European Union.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Allegations of non-compliance with labour legislation in respect of a major construction firm were raised in this House on 8 February 2005 by Deputy Joe Higgins. Those allegations were that certain non-national construction workers were required to work excessive hours and that such workers were in receipt of pay of between &euro;2 and &euro;3 per hour in contravention of the statutory minimums applicable.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department undertook an investigation of these allegations. That investigation was completed within six weeks and required the exclusive attention of three labour inspectors under the direction of two senior members of staff. A report on the investigation was prepared and circulated to relevant parties, including the construction firm involved.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the Department was informed that the firm proposed seeking a judicial review with regard to the investigation and inspector&rsquo;s report. At an interlocutory hearing a judgment was given whereby the Department was restrained from publication of the inspector&rsquo;s report but permitted to forward the document to relevant prosecutorial bodies. On foot of this outcome a copy of the inspector&rsquo;s report was sent to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Competition Authority, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The inspector&rsquo;s report was quashed in the judgment that followed the full High Court hearing of the case. That decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court. Accordingly, I am unable to elaborate any further on the content of the inspector&rsquo;s report or offer any observations on the actions that the prosecutorial bodies mentioned above may be considering.</P>
        <P>I was concerned that all Turkish workers would have access to the money that had been transferred to their bank accounts in Finansbank in Amsterdam. To that end, I and my officials met senior management from Gama Turkey and Gama Ireland, the legal advisers to Gama <Col N="194"/>Turkey, and a human resources consultant retained by Gama. At that meeting, I was assured by these senior managers, their legal adviser and the human resources consultant that all Gama workers in Ireland, past and present, would have full access to the money that had been transferred to their bank accounts in Finansbank.</P>
        <P>I contacted the President of Finansbank. He assured me that, provided the consent of the workers was forthcoming, his bank would co-operate in ensuring that my officials would have sight of relevant bank records in his bank so that they could be satisfied that all workers would have access to the money in their bank accounts. Officials from my Department travelled to Finansbank on 14 April last.</P>
        <P>Following these meetings and contacts which my officials had with SIPTU and Deputy Higgins, I am satisfied that a substantial number of Turkish workers who were in Ireland around last April received value for the funds that had been transferred to their personal bank accounts in Finansbank.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department wrote to Gama Turkey&rsquo;s legal advisers on 29 April seeking certain details on each current and former Gama employee, including the money transferred to Finansbank and the money transferred from Finansbank to their personal bank account in Isbank in Turkey. Despite reminders to Gama Turkey&rsquo;s legal advisers and engagement with a PR company engaged by Gama, this information has not been supplied to date. Accordingly, I cannot assure the Deputy that all Gama workers in Ireland, both past and present, have received value for the amounts that were transferred into their personal accounts in Finansbank.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, there were ongoing contacts between officials of my Department and the company. Matters were brought before the Labour Relations Commission and then the Labour Court. Arising from these actions, substantial transfers of money were secured for workers in lieu of overtime worked. In addition, certain professional Gama workers in respect of whom transfers were not made into Dutch bank accounts were also awarded sums of money by the Labour Court. Many of these Turkish workers have now returned home. A routine inspection by the labour inspectorate of Gama is now under way.</P>

	<P>Enterprise Ireland has been in ongoing contact with the company in question since the day after the fire. The agency met company management on 25 January 2006 to assess the situation and discuss the options available. I understand that an evaluation process is under way to determine the extent of the damage as well as the remaining production capability.

There are many other issues which still need clarification and, as these become clearer, the company will be in a position to make an informed decision on the future of the facility.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has offered to provide any assistance, the company may require, in particular through the use of its regional network of offices to locate premises or manufacturers that may be suitable for temporary production purposes.

Notwithstanding this, F&Aacute;S has been in contact with employer and union representatives to outline the labour market supports that will be made available to those employees who may be out of work for some time. These supports will include vocational guidance, motivational supports, job-seeking skills, technical skills, training and information on job vacancies &mdash; all tailored to meet the needs of each individual. Every assistance possible is being given to the company to ensure that a viable pet food manufacturing facility will continue to exist in Edgeworthstown.</P>

	<P>The Competition Authority is an independent statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State. Accordingly, I have no role in relation to its day-to-day activities.</P>
        <P>I presume, however, that this question relates to the decision of the authority regarding Irish Actors&rsquo; Equity SIPTU and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland concerning the terms and conditions under which advertising agencies hire actors. The authority&rsquo;s decision, which is published on its website,<i> tca.ie,</i> states that while it is perfectly legal for Equity to represent employed actors in collective bargaining with their employers, its trade union mantle cannot exempt its conduct when it acts as a trade association for self-employed contractors. In this particular case the authority determined that the actors in question were self-employed contractors and not employees.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Competition Act prohibits anti-competitive practices, such as price fixing, by undertakings. An undertaking is defined in the Act as &ldquo;a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply, or distribution of goods or the provision of a service&rdquo;. This definition has been in use in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by EU case law.</P>
        <P>I understand that the view expressed by the Competition Authority concerned this particular case only and it should not be taken as a definitive interpretation of the law. It is only the courts which can interpret the law. However, the parties <Col N="197"/>to the investigation appear to have accepted the authority&rsquo;s view as they entered into undertakings in settlement of the case, thereby avoiding the necessity of going to court.</P>
        <P>In considering the question of whether self employed individuals should be permitted to have a trade union negotiate on their behalf, we need to bear in mind that almost any group of self employed contractors, such as barristers, publicans, doctors or pharmacists, could, by coming together, adding union to their name and getting a negotiating licence, attempt to circumvent the protections afforded to consumers by the Oireachtas in the Competition Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The fundamental approach of successive Governments to industrial relations has been one of voluntarism. There is a consensus among the social partners that the terms and conditions of employment of workers are best determined through the process of voluntary bargaining between employers and workers and between employers&rsquo; associations and one trade union or staff association or more. This approach to industrial relations has served us well over the years.</P>
        <P>In general, our laws do not try to impose a solution on parties to a trade dispute but rather are designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences. The State has, by and large, confined its role to underpinning voluntarism through the provision of a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper. Institutions have been established that can assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers such as the Labour Relations Commission, including its rights commissioner service, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The Irish Ferries dispute was ultimately resolved through the utilisation of the industrial relations machinery of the State. The agreement between Irish Ferries, SIPTU and the Seamen&rsquo;s Union of Ireland was brokered by the Labour Relations Commission following the intervention of the national implementation body, and shows that, even in the must difficult of circumstances, our industrial relations and social partnership system is successful at resolving disputes between employers and employees.</P>

	<P>My Department operates an internal early warning system of potential job losses and firms in difficulty based on material provided on a confidential basis by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. This information includes details as to why each particular situation has developed.</P>
        <P>There are various reasons for job losses and factory closures. The early years of this decade saw a substantial restructuring and downturn in the information and communications technology industry globally. This brought about a strong focus on reducing costs and improving efficiency to meet a harsher global demand environment. Ireland is no longer a low-cost economy and we have experienced increased competition from locations elsewhere in the world where goods can be produced more cheaply than here. In addition, innovation and productivity in manufacturing processes have led to increases in output and wage levels for employees but with a reduced employment requirement.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, the year just concluded was the best since 2000 in terms of the range and quality of new investments, the development of our research capability and capacity, and in new jobs created. According to the latest quarterly national household survey published by the Central Statistics Office, 1,989,800 persons were in employment in the third quarter of 2005, an increase of 96,200 in the year.</P>

	<P>As was stated in the reply on this matter to Deputy Howlin in November 2005, the issue of whether legislation to provide for the creation of a new offence of corporate manslaughter as suggested by the Law Reform Commission in its recent report is not a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The main thrust of the recommendations are at a much wider area of responsibility than that covered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and, consequently, the Department does not have a primary function in the matter.</P><Col N="199"/>
        <P>At the time of the launch of the report, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, made it clear that consideration of the report will take place primarily at Government level by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of his main responsibilities for the criminal law system.</P>

	<P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment circulated a discussion document on the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate to the social partners in early 2005. That document has been the basis for further consideration by the employment rights compliance group, ERCG, since September 2005. The ERCG, which is made up of representatives of the social partners, including the CIF and SIPTU, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, is finalising its work in this regard. The outcome of those discussions will inform debate in the context of the talks on a new round of national social partnership.</P>
        <P>Much has been agreed during the course of the ERCG discussions. Final comments from the social partners will be reflected in the finished report and the remaining issues relating to a more effective compliance model and the related organisational aspects have been clearly signalled as being matters for consideration in the forthcoming social partnership discussions.</P>
        <P>The Government is not about reducing the high employment standards that we have attained, rather it is fully committed to working with the social partners not only to maintain but also to build upon and improve the situation of those at work and, in the context of social partnership, has every confidence that agreement will be reached on all outstanding matters to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 330 together.</P>
        <P>Data on the number of jobs that have been relocated to lower cost economies in the past five years are not available nor is it possible to predict how many will be outsourced to overseas locations in the future. Apart from definitional issues, outsourcing is two-way flow; many of the jobs in this economy, especially in the multinational sectors, could be looked upon as having been outsourced to here and we still continue to capture a significant share of such employment. Inter-firm outsourcing is also an important part of the enterprise activity. I would be confident, therefore, that the net gains well exceed the net outflows. This is evidenced at a macro level in the quarterly employment statistics from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the latest of which show that the number of persons in employment grew by 96,200 in the year to reach almost 1.99 million in the third quarter of 2005.</P>
        <P>While it is true that employment in the manufacturing sector has experienced a loss of more than 32,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004, it is impossible to attribute this to outsourcing. It is fair to say that the present competitiveness characteristics of our economy has made a reliance on low technology based manufacturing less sustainable than it was in the past. It is <Col N="201"/>encouraging that the most recent CSO data points to a slight increase in the numbers employed in manufacturing.</P>
        <P>Outsourcing and relocation are inevitable in a free market and open economy like ours and our economic performance has benefited considerably from winning this type of investment from other economies in the past. For some firms, outsourcing of low-end operations makes complete financial and strategic sense and may be the only means to ensure their continued viability. We must recognise that the challenge for Ireland is to attract and retain the high end, higher value added operations that are typified by higher output, improved productivity and greater returns to labour which will ultimately provide longer lasting and higher quality jobs. The enterprise agencies under my Department have adjusted their support strategies to reflect this new paradigm.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including Cork, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency. While I may give general policy directives to IDA Ireland, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving preference to one area over others. However, at the request of the agencies, I can and do assist the agencies from time to time in their efforts to promote Ireland and its regions for new investment and jobs.</P>
        <P>To date in 2006 two new projects have been announced in Cork by Citco and Amgen which will result in 1,350 new jobs at full operation. Citco will create 250 new financial services jobs while the recent Amgen announcement of 1,100 new jobs at an &euro;820 million facility at Carrigtohill is of particular importance being a major global project that has chosen Cork as its development location. These projects follow on from a number of projects announced in 2005 by companies such as Engenio, Siemens, Parsons, VMware, Alps, Cascade Designs and Alcon.</P>
        <P>The loss of the jobs mentioned by the Deputy is regrettable. The recent success means that <Col N="202"/>Ireland is much less competitive as a location for low wage manufacturing jobs. The focus for the future must be to attract investment requiring high skill levels, that are innovation rather than production orientated. Only economic activities with these characteristics will allow us maintain economic growth in the face of increasing competition from emerging economies such as China and India.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for attracting FDI to the south-west region, including Cork is to progress the development of a knowledge economy in the region by targeting sectors such as pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, information and communications technologies, ICT, and internationally traded services via its network of overseas offices and project divisions; work with its existing client base to help them identify new investment opportunities, move up the value chain into higher value products and services and into higher order functions, such as research and development, that are more suited to the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy in the medium to long term; provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure; and work with local authorities and relevant infrastructure and service providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the region.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Cork.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. Data on job creation in supported companies are compiled from an annual employment survey carried out by Forf&aacute;s. The breakdown of IDA Ireland employment data is available only on a regional and county basis.</P>
        <P>County data for 2005 will not be available from IDA Ireland until the end of February. Once the data are available I will arrange that they be forwarded to the Deputy. The number of jobs created by IDA Ireland in County Mayo in each of the years 1995 to 2004, inclusive, is as set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
        <P>It is not possible for IDA Ireland to predict the specific number of FDI jobs that will be created in the county over the next three years as ultimately decisions regarding investment and job creation are taken by supported companies and are highly dependant on global developments as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, com<Col N="204"/>petitive forces, restructuring and technological change.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has advised me that it is actively working towards maximising the level of high value sustainable FDI employment opportunities in Mayo and in the west by investing in the provision of focused property solutions to support this objective. Specifically, IDA Ireland is developing world class business and technology parks in a number of towns throughout Mayo.</P>
        <P>A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. The Government&rsquo;s national spatial strategy provides a framework for the achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations. On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract foreign direct investment into the gateway and hubs as well as a small number of additional locations throughout the west, particularly in Mayo through the linked hub of Ballina, Castlebar and Westport. The attraction of FDI to regional locations is not an easy task, with clients looking at Ireland often only willing to consider larger centres that have the scale, infrastructure and services capable of sustaining their investment.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s sectoral emphasis is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in the medical technologies, life sciences, information and communications technology and international services sectors. The agency is also actively working with the existing base of overseas companies in Mayo to encourage them to grow and expand. In this respect it was heartening to see the recent announcement by Advanced Medical Optics in Westport of its intention to expand its workforce in the future. I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for County Mayo. </P><Col N="203"/>

	<P Just="Left">The 150th Anniversary of the Great Famine was commemorated by the Government in 1995.

        <P>In addition, in the context of State and official visits to countries with large Irish communities often as a result of emigration in the famine years, the opportunity is taken whenever possible to include an appropriate act of remembrance in the official programme.</P>
        <P>I am of the view that there has been a significant and appropriate commemoration to date of the famine and its impact on Ireland and its people. I am satisfied that remembrance and commemoration of the famine will continue to occur on many appropriate occasions.</P>

	<P>The national disability survey, NDS, will be undertaken by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in September 2006. The sample for the survey will be selected on the basis of the responses to the two disability questions in the April 2006 census of population. The survey will broadly follow the definitions and principles outlined in the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s international classification of functioning, disability and health, ICF. The survey questionnaires are being finalised by the CSO in conjunction with a consultative group comprising representatives from Departments, the National Disability Authority and organisations working within the disability sector. Advice has also been sought and <Col N="206"/>received from a very broad range of other organisations, both within Ireland and abroad.</P>
        <P>The overall objective of the survey is to provide a more comprehensive picture of persons reporting a disability in the census of population through an analysis of such factors as the degree of severity, the type of disability, the ability to use transport and the built environment and the extent to which persons with a disability are enabled to participate in education, employment and social life. Results from the survey are expected to be available around mid-2007.</P>

	<P>The CSO&rsquo;s quarterly release on public sector employment and earnings includes information on numbers employed and weekly average earnings. The information on numbers employed relates to all sectors within the public service, while the statistics on average weekly earnings are available for all sectors except health. Owing to the lack of suitably-structured and comparable earnings data across the health sector, only employment data was included for this sector.</P>
        <P>The CSO is phasing in a new survey, the earnings, hours and employment costs survey, which will replace all of the existing short-term earnings surveys. Initially, the industrial and financial sectors are being surveyed. When fully operational, the new survey will cover most of the public and private sectors, including the health sector.</P>
        <P>The survey will provide more detailed information on earnings and labour costs than is available from existing data. It will also make it easier to compare earnings between sectors and categories of workers by providing a measure of earnings per hour as distinct from earnings per week. The CSO has already begun discussions with the Health Service Executive with a view to arranging the compilation of the quarterly earnings data needed for this new survey.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Government has committed &euro;575 million in funding to the new national child care investment programme 2006-2010 which is being implemented by the office of the Minister with responsibility for children. This programme aims to provide a proactive response to enable the development of quality child care supports and services which will be planned for and developed locally. The funding is directed at increasing the supply of early childhood care and education services nationally. The remit of the programme is focused on the development of child care services, primarily those which come within the scope of the Child Care (Pre-school Services) Regulations 1996 and amendment regulations of 1997. This includes child care or early childhood care and education, such as cr&egrave;ches, playgroups, childminding and school age child care but does not include schools or residential centres. The case as described by the Deputy does not come within the remit of the programme.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that in addition to the national child care investment programme, the Government has made provision for an early child care supplement of &euro;1,000 for each child under the age of six years. This payment comes into effect from 1 April. The logistics of the payment are being finalised and details of the arrangements will be announced once they are complete.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
        <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the How Are Our Kids research project undertaken by the childhood development initiative and Dartington social research unit which was published in October 2004. This report was one of eight preliminary research documents which culminated in the publication of A Place for Children, a ten-year strategy by the childhood development initiative in Tallaght west.</P>
        <P>The ten-year strategy was launched by the Taoiseach in October 2005. At that time, the Government welcomed the goals and aims of the initiative and it is clear the strategy is the result of an enormous amount of work at community level.</P>
        <P>The objective of the strategy is to improve children&rsquo;s health, safety, learning and achieving and to increase their sense of community belonging. The Government has put a number of initiatives in place with the ultimate aim of improving children&rsquo;s lives in areas such as Tallaght west. As a Government designated geographic area of disadvantage, namely, a RAPID area, it has been estimated that approximately &euro;27 million was spent in the year 2004-05 by statutory bodies on children&rsquo;s services in the part of it covered by the strategy. I know the project recognises this. This is a substantial sum in the area concerned. Developments through this and other programmes in the areas of education, health and youth justice at national level are mirrored in the approach outlined in the childhood development initiative&rsquo;s ten-year strategy.</P>
        <P>A number of meetings between representatives of this and other related projects have already taken place with the relevant Department&rsquo;s officials. In December 2005, the Government announced the bringing together of a number of functions relating to children and their well-being in the office of the Minister with responsibility for children, OMC, to bring greater coherence to policy making for children. In that context, the office of the Minister with responsibility for children will co-ordinate developments in this matter on behalf of the Government.</P>

	<P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency was established on 2 October 2001 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961. Its main role is to facilitate co-ordination of efforts of all groups in the area of crisis pregnancy prevention. The agency reports that over the past three years, it has increased the level of crisis pregnancy counselling available in the country by more than 50%. Last year, the agency allocated more than &euro;3.5 million towards supports and services within crisis pregnancy.</P>
        <P>A report, The Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System, known as the Prospectus report, considered the structures and functions of the different specialist, advisory, regulatory and executive agencies within the health system and recommended the mainstreaming of many of them. It is in that context that I am considering at present the most appropriate future organisational arrangements in respect of the agency having regard to the separation of policy and executive functions, which is a key objective of the health service reform programme.</P>

	<P>The annual organ donor awareness campaign, which is organised by the Irish donor network and administered by the Irish Kidney Association, highlights the necessity for organ donation generally. The campaign, which is supported by my Department, highlights the need for organ donors by promoting the carrying of a organ donor card.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are two systems that can be used to ascertain an individual&rsquo;s wishes on organ donation: the opt-in system and the opt-out system. The former system, which operates in this country, requires that the specific consent to donation of each person or the person's relatives be obtained before organs or tissues are removed. The opt-out system presumes that all citizens consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary.</P>
        <P>The practice in this country is that, even when a person has indicated his or her willingness to donate organs by way of carrying an organ donor card or a driving licence marked accordingly, the consent of the next-of-kin is always sought. Even where opt-out systems are in operation, the relatives of the deceased are approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour. Thus, the relatives will always be aware that a donation is being considered and can register an objection to the donation.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific eval<Col N="212"/>uation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union and it is expected that this report will inform decisions regarding the development of a legislative framework in this area.</P>
        <P>In the context of increasing the number of donor organs available for transplant, the Health Service Executive has been asked by the Department to undertake a review and analysis of the factors that impact on organ procurement and retrieval rates in hospitals.</P>

	<P>The provision of an out-of-hours service in the context of the development of family support and child care services, including the implementation of the <Col N="214"/>youth homelessness strategy, is identified in action 27 of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You. While some progress has been made in certain areas of the country on the provision of out-of-hours services, the issue of a national formalised arrangement on such services, including the provision of social work services, is a matter for negotiation between the Health Service Executive and the trade unions representing the staff interests concerned. The HSE is reviewing the youth homelessness strategy action plans of its regions. The Department of Health and Children will have discussions on the outcome of the review with the HSE. The issue of out-of-hours arrangements will be examined in this context and in the wider context of the development of child care and family support services. I have asked the HSE to give the Deputy information on the current out-of-hours arrangements in child care and family support services.</P>

	<P>Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly allowance paid by the Health Service Executive. It may be paid in respect of eligible children aged 16 or under who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention that is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The current rate of the allowance is &euro;250.90 per month. The allowance was traditionally administered in respect of resident children only. Since May 2005, following a change to Regulation (EC) 1408/71 on foot of a judgment of the European Court of Justice, the allowance has been classed as a family benefit under the provisions of the regulation. As a consequence, it is payable in respect of non-resident children of EU nationals employed in Ireland whose children meet the qualifying criteria. The HSE, which has been notified of the changed position, is implementing procedures to comply with the change to <Col N="216"/>the regulation. It is not possible to calculate how many of the children of non-Irish EU nationals working in Ireland may potentially be eligible to receive this payment. Similarly, it is not possible to determine the nationality of such people. The HSE is not in a position to state how many of the approximately 16,000 people in receipt of the allowance are non-Irish EU citizens.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As asthma is not a notifiable illness, information regarding its incidence is not routinely collected by the Department of Health and Children. People who cannot without undue hardship arrange for the provision of medical services for them and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. The Health Service Executive can take the medical costs incurred by an individual or a family into account as part of the assessment process. In November 2004, I introduced a new graduated benefit in the form of the GP visit card, which will extend free GP care and treatment to individuals and families on low incomes. In June 2005, I simplified the means test for medical and GP visit cards so it is now based on the income of an applicant and his or her spouse after income tax and PRSI. The means test now takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. In October, I announced that the income guidelines for medical and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%, which means the income guidelines are 29% higher than this time last year.</P>
        <P>Such improvements have made the assessment process much fairer and ensure that people on <Col N="218"/>low to moderate incomes can qualify for free GP care. Non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which protects against excessive medicine costs. Under the scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month, or approximately &euro;20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme, which is easy to use, significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines for the treatment of illnesses such as asthma. The Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>

	<P>One of my key concerns is the protection of the public. The national regulation of complementary therapists working group has reported to the Department of Health and Children with recommendations on future measures for strengthening the regulatory environment for complementary therapists. I will carefully consider the group&rsquo;s recommendations, which will inform the next steps in this area. One of the challenges facing the consumer is making informed health care choices. To this end, the Department is in the final stages of preparing an information leaflet for the general public, offering guidance to people when deciding to see a complementary therapist, including questions to ask the practitioner before embarking on treatment. A key message is that patients with conditions which may require medical treatment should see their doctor first. I strongly advise members of the public to take this message seriously.</P>

	<P>An Bord Altranais has statutory responsibility for the registration of nurses under the Nurses Act 1985. The Deputy will appreciate that the board is obliged to process each appli<Col N="221"/>cation thoroughly to ensure that those entered on the register of nurses are deemed professionally qualified and competent for such registration. The protection of the public underpins this process. I have been advised that the board discharges its functions in a professional manner. All applicants are informed of all the entry requirements. Applicants trained outside the EU are assessed. If they meet the board&rsquo;s requirements, credit is given for education and practical experience gained in their country of origin and other states where they have worked. There are no plans to review the requirements for registration in the general division of the register of nurses in respect of training received outside of the European Union as they are benchmarked against EU standards which are legally established. I understand that a decision in the case of the applicant referred to by the Deputy was issued by the board in May 2005. The person subsequently appealed the decision, but the original decision was upheld. A senior official from the board subsequently met the applicant and provided advice on the standards required for registration in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I am fully committed to the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. My Department has requested the Health Service Executive to prepare a detailed implementation plan for a national programme. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call and recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money. All elements of the programme, call and recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</P>
        <P>Significant preparatory work is well under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register. My Department made available an additional &euro;9 million to the executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for the roll-out. I consider that the programme should be best rolled <Col N="222"/>out in the primary care setting, subject to affordable and acceptable arrangements being agreed. A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision by general practitioners of publicly-funded primary care services is being conducted at present, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. I have requested that the general practitioner elements of a national cervical screening programme be tabled at these discussions. Any remuneration arrangements agreed must be capable of delivering a high uptake among women. Payments must be primarily based on reaching acceptable targets.</P>
        <P>I am convinced that we must also have in place tailored initiatives to encourage take-up among disadvantaged and difficult to reach groups. I wish to see the programme rolled out as quickly as possible but only when the essential infrastructure, organisation and services are in place that are quality assured and meet international standards.</P>

        <Quest>the way in which the Health Service Executive can take the value of a house in the assessment for nursing home subvention, when the property is not being rented out by the family and the property is vacant when the parents go into full-time care.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, the Health Service Executive is empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been approved on both means and dependency grounds, as provided for in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993. This contribution will assist a person with the cost of his or her care in a private nursing home.</P>
        <P>The Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Section 13 of the regulations states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A health board may impute an annual income equivalent to 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of the person, if it was not occupied immediately prior to or at the time of the application by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension.</P><Col N="223"/>
        <P FLI="0">Certain thresholds were set in the 1993 regulations for the means and assets of a person applying for a subvention. These thresholds had not been updated since they were set in 1993. The Nursing Homes Subvention (Amendment) Regulations 2005, amended the thresholds contained in the 1993 regulations by increasing the value of assets to be disregarded for the purposes of subvention assessment from &pound;6,000, or &euro;7,618, to &euro;11,000, increasing the asset threshold above which subvention may be refused from &pound;20,000, or &euro;25,394, to &euro;36,000 and increasing the threshold of principal residence value above which subvention may be refused from &pound;75,000, or &euro;95,230, to &euro;500,000 or more,where the residence is located in the Dublin area, or &euro;300,000 or more, where the residence is located outside the Dublin area, provided that the applicant&rsquo;s income is greater than &euro;9,000. This was previously &pound;5,000, or &euro;6,349.</P>
        <P>The HSE continues to retain the discretion to impute an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension, and generally does so unless there are exceptional circumstances. However, the residence value above which they may automatically refuse to pay a subvention has been increased substantially, as outlined, to take account of increased property values. The Department is also working on primary legislation to expand the policies and principles of the subvention scheme to facilitate implementation of the scheme by the HSE throughout the country, and it is the intention to bring this legislation before the Oireachtas in the near future.</P>

	<P>The youth homelessness strategy was published on 31 October 2001. The strategy provides a strategic framework for youth homelessness to be tackled on a national basis. The goal of the strategy is to reduce and if possible eliminate youth homelessness through preventative strategies and where a child becomes homeless to ensure that he or she benefits from a comprehensive range of services aimed at reintegrating him/her into his or her community as quickly as possible. Under the strategy, the former health boards, now the Health Service Executive, have lead responsibility for implementation of the strategy and they prepared detailed action plans in this regard to address youth homelessness in line with the objectives set out in the strategy. During 2005, my Department requested the HSE to undertake a review of the action plans to ascertain the extent of their implementation. A report on this matter is awaited.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>In addition to the above, the national children&rsquo;s office, now part of the recently established Office of the Minister for Children, had been assigned responsibility by the Cabinet committee in co-ordinating and monitoring the implementation of the youth homelessness strategy. In this regard, the youth homelessness strategy monitoring committee, under the chairmanship of the aforementioned national children&rsquo;s office and representative of the child care policy unit of my Department and other relevant stakeholders, was established. The committee identified key areas, which required attention in order to drive the implementation of the strategy in an effective, co-ordinated way, on a nationwide basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of sub-groups were established as follows. The programme of action for children office, a unit within the health board structure <Col N="227"/>with a co-ordinating function across all health board regions, agreed to take on the co-ordination and linkages functions within the HSE arena. The Office of the Minister for Children will continue to deal with cross-sectoral co-ordination issues. National guidelines on leaving and aftercare were approved by the monitoring committee and were circulated by my Department to the former health boards in July 2004. The purpose of the guidelines is to assist the HSE in developing its leaving and aftercare policies with the aim of,<i> inter alia</i>, protecting those leaving care who may be vulnerable to homelessness. The statistics sub-group recommended the introduction of a new youth homelessness contact form as a way of gathering more reliable and consistent statistics. My Department circulated the form to the former health boards in December 2003 for introduction on 1 January 2004. A total of 492 children appeared to the Health Service Executive to be homeless in 2004 as per provisional statistical returns. These returns have yet to be validated with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>A sub-group was established to look at the education and training objectives of the youth homelessness strategy. Membership of the group included representatives of the statutory and voluntary education and health sectors. It was agreed that there was a need to look at a broad understanding of the homelessness process to understand the potential impact of education and training elements as part of the solution for young people who are homeless. Consideration was given to the preventive aspect of educational and training interventions; processes to ensure that education and training elements form part of the ongoing support of children and young people who are homeless; and the role of education and training in the prevention and reintegration of children in the care or detention systems. The group finalised its report and it was sent to the relevant Departments, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Health Service Executive on 21 June 2005.</P>
        <P>A sub-group was established to examine information and advocacy in the context of the youth homelessness strategy, with a particular focus on making relevant information more accessible to young homeless people or young people at risk of becoming homeless. The group finalised its report and it was sent to my Department, the Health Service Executive and Comhairle on 21 November 2005. Since the publication of the youth homelessness strategy, significant progress has been made. Approximately &euro;12 million has been allocated by the Department of Health and Children to the former health boards for the development of youth homelessness services since 2001. A total of 195 new whole-time equivalent posts were filled across the Health Service Executive, up to 31 December 2004. Although these posts impact on youth homelessness services, they are not all exclusively dedicated to <Col N="228"/>youth homelessness services. Eleven new units have opened nationwide. Over 42 new or extended services, including aftercare, have been developed around the country.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services. In recent years many services have been developed to counter the problem of youth homelessness in the Dublin region. The crisis intervention service for young people out of home is based in the city centre and includes an outreach service, emergency out of hours social work service, reception centre, residential units and a day centre. A director for homelessness was appointed in the former eastern regional health authority, or Health Service Executive eastern area, in 2000. This is now the role of the national care group manager social inclusion since the establishment of the Health Service Executive. In Cork, Liberty Street House became fully operational in 2003, and acts as a focal point for youth homelessness services in Cork. The centre provides a variety of services, social work, medical, financial advice for young people out of home or in danger of becoming homeless.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Services for homeless children are also provided by the other Health Service Executive areas and generally these are provided as part of the child protection and welfare services. The services provided include units for young people out of home supported lodgings, and the provision of out-reach, leaving and aftercare services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There has been no diminution in the number of acute hospital beds since 1997. The average number of inpatient beds and day places available in HSE network acute hospitals in 1997 was 11,727. The average number of inpatient beds and day places available in HSE network acute hospitals in December 2005, the latest date for which figures are available, was 13,255. It is important to note that the numbers of beds available in any hospital may fluctuate over time depending on service demands and other factors such as seasonal closures and refurbishment.</P>
        <P>An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to expand public hospital beds in line with the health strategy commitment to increase total acute hospital bed capacity by 3,000 by 2011. Substantial investment in additional bed capacity in acute hospitals has already taken place. Funding has been provided to open an additional 900 in-patient beds or day places in public acute hospitals throughout the country. The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that at the end of 2005, 806 of these beds or day places were in place and the remaining 94 beds or day places will come on stream this year.</P>
        <P>In addition, up to 450 acute beds or day places are in various stages of planning and development under the health capital programme. The Estimates for 2006 include &euro;60 million to open new acute hospital facilities some of which will provide additional beds. I announced in July last year an initiative which will provide up to an additional 1,000 beds for public patients in public hospitals. My Department, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, will be reviewing public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector in the light of developments since the health strategy was published.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the Health Service Executive is empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been approved on both means and dependency grounds, as provided for in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993. This contribution will assist a person with the cost of the his or her care in a private nursing home.</P>
        <P>The second schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Certain thresholds were set in the 1993 regulations for the means and assets of a person applying for a subvention. These thresholds had not been updated since they were set in 1993. The Nursing Homes Subvention (Amendment) Regulations 2005 amended the thresholds contained in the 1993 regulations by increasing the value of assets to be disregarded for the purposes of subvention assessment from &pound;6,000, or &euro;7,618, to &euro;11,000, increasing the asset threshold above which subvention may be refused from &euro;25,394 to &euro;36,000 and increasing the threshold of principal residence value above which subvention may be refused from &pound;75,000, or &euro;95,230, to &euro;500,000 or more, where the residence is located in the Dublin area, or &euro;300,000 or more where the residence is located outside the Dublin area, provided that the applicant&rsquo;s income is greater than &euro;9,000. This was previously &pound;5,000, or &euro;6,349.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE continues to retain the discretion to impute an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension, and generally does so unless there are exceptional circumstances. However, the residence value and asset threshold above which it may automatically refuse to pay a subvention has been increased substantially, as outlined, to take account of increased property values. The Department is also working on primary legislation to expand the policies and principles of the subvention scheme to facilitate implementation of the scheme by the HSE throughout the country, and it is the intention to bring this legislation before the Oireachtas in the near future.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Regulation (EC) 1408/71 facilitates free movement of workers and others within the EU by providing for co-ordination between member states&rsquo; health care and social security systems. In relation to health care, its provisions ensure that where people are affiliated with the health care system of one member state, insured with that system or covered by it, but residing or staying in another member state, they can access the public health care system of that member state in certain circumstances. The regulation provides for the reimbursement of health care costs in one member state to persons affiliated with the health care system of another member state.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Revised Estimates volume 2005 shows an estimate of &euro;422.2 million in appropriations-in-aid to the HSE Vote in respect of reimbursement of the costs of health care provided under this regulation. This figure represents the estimated net liability in 2005 of the UK to Ireland for the costs of health care provided under the terms of the Regulation (EC) 1408/71. Such persons include temporary visitors from the UK, UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland, and the dependent families residing in Ireland of persons employed in the UK. Under the terms of a bilateral reimbursement agreement in place since 1973 between the two countries, this liability has been calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to other EU member states, the costs of health care are mutually waived in respect of Belgium, except for costs arising from accidents at work and occupational diseases, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, France, except for costs arising in respect of pensioners, Netherlands, Austria and Sweden. The costs of health care provided to persons, mainly tempor<Col N="233"/>ary visitors, affiliated with the health care system of the remaining member states, prior to expansion, are very low and historically have not been collected as the administrative costs of doing so would be expected to exceed the likely receipts. Nevertheless, in view of the expansion of the European Union, the HSE is considering the data collection procedures necessary to provide an up-to-date assessment of these costs.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and I regard the support of older people to stay in their own homes and communities as a key policy priority and thereby moving away from the practice of placing people in residential care as a first option. This is the expressed wish of the majority of our older people.</P>
        <P>Additional funding has been allocated for services for older people and palliative care amounting to &euro;150 million in budget 2006 &mdash;&euro;110 million for 2006 and &euro;40 million more for 2007. Approximately two thirds of this money, or &euro;109 million, of the full year costs has been allocated to community support for older people. There will be a well-funded and viable alternative to long-term residential care in the form of home care packages and additional home help hours. In regard to the packages, it is expected that an extra 2,000 will be available by the end of this year; this will be approximately triple the number of such supports that were provided last year.</P>
        <P>This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people, reflecting this Government&rsquo;s commitment to older people and putting them at the centre of health policy in the future. The investment package is a major step in focusing new resources on home care first and foremost, while still supporting appropriate residential care, where an additional &euro;20 million has been provided to the HSE for this year. Home care packages deliver a wide range of services and have been piloted successfully in several regions in recent years. They include various disciplines and will vary according to the care needs of the person so that, for example, there might be a greater emphasis in some packages on home care assistants while other packages may require a greater level of therapy and nursing.</P>
        <P>Home helps are another essential part of supporting older people at home and thereby delaying or preventing admission to long stay residential care. There is a continuing demand for home helps because of the increased number of older people. An additional &euro;33 million full year cost is <Col N="234"/>now being allocated for this programme, &euro;30 million of which will be for 2006, providing an additional 1.75 million home help hours.</P>

The former system, which operates in this country, requires that the specific consent to donation of each person, or the person's relatives, be obtained before organs or tissues are removed. The opt-out system presumes that all citizens consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary.</P>
        <P>The practice in this country is that even when a person has indicated his or her willingness to donate organs by way of carrying an organ donor card, or a driving licence marked accordingly, the consent of the next-of-kin is always sought. Even where opt-out systems are in operation, the relatives of the deceased are approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour. Thus, the relatives will always be aware that a donation is being considered and can register an objection to the donation.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union and it is expected that this report will inform decisions regarding the development of a legislative framework in this area.</P>
        <P>In the context of increasing the number of donor organs available for transplant, the Health Service Executive has been asked by the Department to undertake a review and analysis of the factors that impact on organ procurement and retrieval rates in hospitals around the country.</P>

This includes responsibility for the management of human resources, including remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment. The parliamentary affairs division of the executive has therefore been asked to respond directly to the Deputy in regard to the issues raised.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will of course be aware of the range of personnel required to deliver health services and that some services are delivered around the clock. By way of context, he will wish to note that my Department&rsquo;s health service employment census shows a total of 101,513 wholetime equivalent staff, excluding home helps, at end September 2005 employed in different care settings by the Health Service Executive, voluntary hospitals and the intellectual disability services. This equates to almost 120,000 individuals and almost 500 grades. Depending on the grade and the nature of the service delivered, staff may be remunerated on the basis of allowances and other premia pay in addition to basic salary. During the time period referred to by the Deputy, pay levels for staff have been determined under the terms of the social partnership agreements and, in some instances, by special pay awards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

Further details on how this scheme will operate will be produced by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the coming months, once the necessary EU State aid approval has been obtained.</P>
        <P>However, it is clear that it would not be possible for any scheme providing excise duty exemption for biofuels to make such exemption conditional upon the biofuel concerned being produced only in Ireland. This would be in contravention of Ireland&rsquo;s duty under EU competition law, not to distort competition in the Common Market. Inclusion of any such condition in the new scheme would lead to refusal of our <Col N="241"/>application for the aforementioned EU State aid approval.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, one of the aims of the new scheme is to create, in so far as is possible, the development of biomass-feedstock production in Ireland to support the development of a sustainable domestic biofuels industry and we must try and reflect this in the new scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The following table lists the pay rates in place at the time of the general election on 17 May 2002 and the revised scales since then for the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Ministers, Ministers of State, Deputies and Senators. The table also lists all subsequent pay increases &mdash; general, review body on higher remuneration in the public sector and Benchmarking.</P>
        <P>Report No. 38 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector recommended that the salary of a Deputy should be set at the ordinary maximum of the grade of principal &mdash; standard &mdash; in the Civil Service, and that the salary of a Senator should be fixed as 70% of that of a Deputy and should be revised for the future on that basis. The provision of long service increments for Deputies and Senators is in line with the views expressed in the above review body report. Therefore, as a result of this recommendation any increases awarded by the public service benchmarking body will be paid to Deputies and Senators.</P>
        <P>The salary of the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Minister and Minister of State is made up of two elements: the office holder&rsquo;s salary plus the Deputy&rsquo;s basic salary. While the Deputy&rsquo;s element of the salary is determined in the manner set out above, the office holder&rsquo;s element is based on general pay increases and a report by the review body on higher remuneration. The office holder&rsquo;s salary does not attract increases recommended by the public service benchmarking body.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 34 of the Finance Act 2005 introduced a number of changes to the capital allowance regime for hotels, guesthouses, holiday hostels and holiday camps. Guesthouses and holiday hostels were specifically brought into the capital allowances regime for the first time. Also, the entitlement to the capital allowances was provided for the first time on the basis of buildings being registered in the appropriate F&aacute;ilte Ireland register.</P>
        <P>Following the Finance Act 2005 changes, the Revenue administrative practice granting capital allowances in respect of buildings and structures <Col N="246"/>erected in a registered caravan park was reviewed. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism held discussions with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance while examining submissions made to it on behalf of the Irish Caravan and Camping Council, ICCC. As a result of these discussions the Revenue Commissioners decided that retention of a non-statutory scheme on behalf of caravan parks was not appropriate and decided to withdraw it with effect from 1 January 2006. Allowances in respect of expenditure incurred before that date are not affected.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that some of the expenditure that would typically be incurred by these caravan park operators may be eligible for the plant and machinery capital allowances but this would not generally include any buildings or structures.</P>

        <P>The information regarding the number and location of buildings surveyed, being surveyed or being treated for asbestos is given in the following table. The Commissioners of Public Works are finalising their 2006 programme in the light of these surveys and in consultation with the occupants of the buildings involved.</P>
        <P>The availability of medical screening to staff etc. in buildings where asbestos has been detected is a matter for the relevant Departments or Government offices and I am aware that such arrangements are in place generally on request. In addition, full consultative procedures in relation to the management of asbestos in buildings have been in place for some time under the general direction of the commissioners. These <Col N="247"/>arrangements will continue for the duration of the programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 278 and 279 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where Revenue are satisfied that one spouse is resident in the State and the other spouse is not so resident and the non-resident spouse has no income, then the resident spouse may be granted the full tax credits and tax rate bands applicable to married couples under joint assessment. I am further informed that, where one spouse is resident in the State and the other spouse is not so resident and the non-resident spouse has income and Revenue are satisfied as to these matters, then depending on the extent of the non-resident spouse&rsquo;s income, the resident spouse may be granted a limited form of the tax credits and tax rate bands applicable to married couples under joint assessment. The reason that the resident spouse cannot avail of the full tax credits and tax rates bands applicable to married couples under joint assessment is because the foreign income of the non-resident spouse cannot be taxed in the State.</P>
        <P>With regard to entitlement to the home carer tax credit, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the credit would not be due in the scenario outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. The reason for this is that, where one spouse is resident in the State &mdash; the claimant &mdash; and the other spouse &mdash; the &ldquo;carer spouse&rdquo; for the purposes of the tax credit &mdash; is not so resident, the dependent person, the person being cared for, would not, therefore, be residing with the claimant which is a main condition attaching to eligibility for the home carer tax credit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, taxpayer confidentiality requires that a Minister for Finance does not answer a parliamentary question about the tax affairs of an individual or company, other than when the Deputy is asking the question on behalf of the individual or company. In this instance, it is not clear that this is the case and in the circumstances, I regret I cannot comment on the tax affairs of any taxpayer.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the matter is still under investigation and as there is non-co-operation by the former employer, the date of completion is not known at this time. Revenue is aware that the continued difficulties being encountered with the former employer are resulting in a delay in the issue of form P21, which is necessary to finalise the third level grant applications for the taxpayer&rsquo;s children. The Revenue Commissioners advise me that they are taking appropriate steps to expedite the completion of their investigation in this matter.</P>

        <Quest>if he will make a provision in the Finance Act 2006 to make farmers and other land owners exempt of the 20% capital gains tax that they have to pay on land they have been forced to sell due to compulsory purchase orders to make way for road development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Capital gains tax, CGT, is a tax on a capital gain arising on the disposal of assets. A 20% rate of CGT applies on the gains arising on the disposal of assets, including land which is the subject of a compulsory purchase order, CPO. This is the lowest rate of CGT in recent history. In budget 1998, the rate was halved from 40% to 20%. Where compensation is received for land that is compulsorily acquired, any gains arising from the amount paid for the acquisition of the land are chargeable to tax. In other words, if there is a sum paid by a public authority for the compulsory acquisition of land, then irrespective of its components, for example, disturbance, injurious affection etc., that total sum will be the amount to be assessed for tax. The CGT due on a disposal of land under a CPO is calculated in the same way as any other disposal of land. The consideration for the disposal will be the sum received for the land. There are no plans to make any changes to the legislation in this regard.</P>

	<P>The concept of ethical investment does not form part of the current legal framework governing investment activities. Ethical investment differs from conventional investment in that investment decisions are determined, at least partly, by non-financial criteria underpinned by personal beliefs or opinions. The ethical policy underlying a particular investment may be set out in a number of documents including the prospectus or the investment agreement. The ethical policy of a company may be prescribed in the memorandum and articles of association of that company. I have no plans to introduce specific legislative arrangements governing the area of ethical investment.</P>
        <P>As regards the promotion and sale of investment products, the legislative framework governing the authorisation and ongoing supervision of investment firms and exchanges is set out in the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 and the Stock Exchange Act 1995. The legislative basis for the financial regulator&rsquo;s supervisory function in relation to collective investment schemes is set <Col N="251"/>out in several Acts and regulations dating from 1989. Further details of the regulation of financial services firms may be found on the financial regulator&rsquo;s website at <i>www.financialregulator.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The regulation of the gas market is delegated to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. It is open to any intending supplier of gas to any town to apply to the CER for consent to lay the necessary pipe work, and for a licence to supply natural gas. The CER must be satisfied that a proposal to extend the natural gas distribution network is an economic proposition before it will grant consent for it, as otherwise uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers. As the Deputy will be aware, the CER has recently engaged in a public consultation process on proposed changes to gas connection policy and charges. The proposed changes would bring significant benefits, including encouraging the connection of new loads to the network where such <Col N="252"/>connection is economically feasible in the longer term.</P>

	<P>The central and regional fisheries boards devote considerable effort and resources, in collaboration with Tourism Ireland, to the promotion of angling tourism. The overall decline in angling tourism is not unique to Ireland but reflects a trend widespread in Europe. The report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in September 2003 observes a decline in activity holidays which is not confined to angling but also includes cycling and hillwalking.</P>
        <P>I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is carrying out research among tour operators involved in promoting special activity holidays and special activity holidaymakers. Problems identified include rising costs and access to activities. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also identified angling among main areas of activity for which detailed marketing plans have been agreed, targeting the markets offering the best short-term return. Several other supporting activities are identified across all products including greater understanding of international trends in demand for special interest products.</P>
        <P>Fish habitats and stocks are under threat from a variety of adverse environmental and water quality pressures both at sea and in rivers and estuaries. These pressures, along with over-exploitation of stocks, pose a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of this natural resource.</P>
        <P>Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the protection, conservation and management of inland fisheries stocks rests with the central and regional fisheries boards. As Minister <Col N="255"/>with responsibility for the marine, I rely on the advice of the fisheries boards and the National Salmon Commission when determining policy and legislative measures aimed at protecting these stocks. Any such measures that may be recommended to me, whether in respect of game or coarse angling, will be considered with a view to their early implementation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government has, to date, consistently ruled out buy-out as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks and has instead, since 2002, promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective.</P>
        <P>Moreover, no convincing case has been advanced as to the public good that would be acquired by the State in the context of a publicly funded buy-out of commercial salmon licences nor why stakeholders benefiting from increased numbers of salmon entering the rivers should not contribute in whole or in part towards achieving <Col N="256"/>that increase. The Deputy will be aware of the joint Oireachtas committee&rsquo;s acknowledgement that any compensatory schemes should largely be funded by those stakeholders who would be the main economic beneficiaries of more salmon being free to return to the rivers. I also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the committee&rsquo;s comment that &ldquo;public moneys spent must have, as a primary aim, ensuring the survival of the salmon species and that this precept must be regarded as more important than any economic gain to any sector that may accrue&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>As I have previously and consistently indicated to the House, I have no plans at present to introduce a buy-out of commercial salmon fishing licences but I am continuing to review the matter in the context of the policy outlined above. In this regard, I would be open to any relevant proposals presented to me whereby stakeholders benefiting from any reduction in commercial catch would engage in the first instance with licence holders and indicate a willingness to address any compensation issues that might arise. In the event of a compensatory scheme being identified, it is my view that the economic beneficiaries should contribute to the scheme.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that I have referred the broad outline proposals, which were submitted to me, to the National Salmon Commission recently for an objective evaluation in accordance with its terms of reference in the overall context of conservation management measures designed to achieve the alignment of national and district total allowable catches and quotas. I await its advice in this regard.</P>

	<P>The function of the licensing authority for sea-fishing boats was transferred under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. The Act provides that the licensing authority is independent in the exercise of its functions under the Act, subject to the law for the time being in force and policy directives in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing.</P>
        <P>The two applicants referred to by the Deputy had been refused a sea-fishing boat licence by the licensing authority under the scheme for the <Col N="257"/>licensing of traditional pot-fishing boats in the Irish inshore fleet. One of the conditions of the scheme was that an applicant must not currently be in full-time employment outside the fishing industry. There was evidence that both applicants were in full-time employment outside the fishing industry and their applications were therefore refused. They appealed the refusals to an appeals officer appointed under the 2003 Act. The appeals officer upheld the licensing authority&rsquo;s refusal but recommended that favourable consideration be given by the licensing authority to an application for a licence by the appellants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The licensing authority has informed me that it does not have discretion to vary the terms of the pot licence scheme and accordingly it is unable to issue an offer to the applicants for a licence under that scheme.

These international instruments include, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
        <P>The convention referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990, and it entered into force on 1 July 2003, following ratification by the requisite number of states, that is, 20. The convention has been open for signature and ratification since December 1990. However, to date, only 34 states have ratified it. No European Union member state has as yet signed or ratified the convention, nor has any indicated an intention to do so.</P>
        <P>The position essentially is that, in order for Ireland to ratify the convention, significant changes would have to be made across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing employment, social welfare provision, education, taxation and electoral law. These changes would also have implications for our EU commitments. The operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK might also possibly be affected. The situation is being kept under review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Significant progress continues to be made on initiatives which benefit our Irish community abroad. A particularly positive development is the very substantial level of funding now available. In 2006, the unprecedented amount of &euro;12 million has been secured for emigrant services. This figure, which represents an increase of 45% on 2005, is a clear reflection of the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to the welfare of our community abroad.</P>
        <P>The Government greatly appreciates the invaluable work of the excellent network of community care agencies that assist Irish people abroad. Their services make a critical difference to the circumstances of many of our more vulnerable emigrants. Officials of my Department&rsquo;s Irish abroad unit and our embassies will continue to work closely with them so as to ensure the effective allocation of increased funding.</P>
        <P>The needs of the Irish community in Britain, in particular older people and those at risk of social exclusion, remain a key priority. In 2005, groups in Britain received grants amounting to &euro;7.06 million, an increase of 63% on 2004. While the primary emphasis of funding continues to be to support frontline welfare services, I am pleased that the additional funding has also made it possible to support a number of capital projects, as well as projects which foster a greater sense of community.</P>
        <P>Another priority area is that of our undocumented community in the United States. As the Deputy is aware, the legislative debate in the United States on immigration reform has entered a critical phase. In the period ahead, I will continue to lobby strongly in support of measures which would improve the circumstances of the undocumented Irish.</P>
        <P>During 2005, I was pleased to approve grants of &euro;750,000 to the Irish immigration centres in the United States. The invaluable services that they provide to our community there are of particular relevance to the undocumented at this complex time of uncertainty. The high priority which the Government attaches to the issue of the undocumented is also clear from the grant of &euro;30,000 which I recently approved to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, a group established to mobilise grassroots support within the Irish community for immigration reform.</P><Col N="261"/>
        <P>In 2005, I was also happy to announce increased funding to Irish emigrant groups in Australia and, for the first time, to a group in Canada which supports our older community in Toronto. Increased financial support was also directed to organisations in Ireland that are engaged in pre-departure information for intending emigrants, and assistance to emigrants returning to Ireland.</P>
        <P>I look forward to enhancing our relationship with, and support for, our communities abroad during 2006.</P>

	<P>The Government attaches the highest priority to the issue of the undocumented Irish in the United States. We raise our concerns in all of our contacts with US political leaders and emphasise the importance of addressing the situation in a positive and sympathetic way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In raising this matter with our US contacts, we of course appreciate that immigration is a highly divisive issue. The extent of differing opinion on this sensitive matter was evident in recent debates in the House of Representatives around the passage through that House of the Sensenbrenner-King immigration Bill. This Bill, which is one of many currently before the US Congress, concentrates on enforcement and security measures, and does not propose provisions that would regularise the status of the undocumented.</P>
        <P>The focus of the debate now shifts to the Senate, which has before it a number of bills. Of these, the approach proposed by Senators Kennedy and McCain is particularly attractive as, if adopted, it would offer the undocumented a path to permanent residency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In all of my meetings with US contacts, including with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and with key congressional figures, most recently in Carlingford in January, I have made known our support, and the support of the Oireachtas, for the approach favoured by Senators Kennedy and McCain. Their Bill has also been strongly endorsed by the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, a group established recently to mobilise grassroots support within the Irish community in the US for immigration reform. I welcome the establishment of this organisation and recently approved a grant to it of &euro;30,000 towards its operational expenses.</P>
        <P>While there have been significant developments, it is clear that the legislative situation is fluid and that achieving the necessary compromise on this sensitive issue remains a formidable challenge. In this regard, I welcome the engagement of President Bush on this issue and his sup<Col N="262"/>port for a humane approach which involves reform as well as enforcement. The Deputy can be assured that the Government will continue to lobby intensively on this issue in the critical period ahead.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ireland opposes, and seeks the elimination of the practice of human trafficking. The Taoiseach, in his intervention at the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Third Summit in Warsaw on 16 and 17 May 2005, welcomed the adoption of the Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings, as well as the conventions on terrorism opened for signature at the summit, as &ldquo;[laying] down a strong marker that these evils within European Society are unacceptable and not to be tolerated&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings is currently under consideration by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has responsibility for policy in this area. Legislation is being prepared by that Department which will criminalise trafficking in human beings for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation as provided for in the EU Council framework decision on combating trafficking in persons. This legislation will also take account of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings. Putting the necessary legislation in place would put Ireland in a position to ratify the convention.</P>

	<P>I have not met with the particular organisation referred to by the Deputy. The Government, of course, monitors the human rights situation in Iran closely, through our embassy in Tehran and in co-operation with our partners in the EU. This involves regular contact with non-governmental organisations both within and outside Iran.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We remain seriously concerned about human rights issues in Iran, including the use of the death penalty and the detention of political prisoners. Our concerns are raised regularly with the Iranian authorities. The meeting of the European <Col N="263"/>Council in Brussels on 16 December 2005 issued a declaration on the situation in the Middle East, which reiterated the deep concern of the EU at the lack of respect for human rights and fundamental political freedoms in Iran, and called on Iran to demonstrate respect for these principles by taking concrete steps, including the permanent release of prisoners of conscience. The European Council emphasised that the development of the EU&rsquo;s long-term relationship with Iran will depend on progress on all issues of concern. These include the human rights situation.</P>

	<P>Where it is sought to transport munitions of war through Irish territory, the permission of the Minister for Transport, in the case of civilian aircraft, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the case of foreign military aircraft, is required. The grant of such permission depends upon several different factors, among them air safety, Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under international agreements, and policy considerations. A search of the records held by both Departments has shown that there have been no applications for the transport of depleted uranium munitions from the period building up to the Iraq war to the present day. The US Embassy has been contacted about this matter and confirmed that its records support this.</P>

The advocate general proposes that Commission Decision 2004/535/EC, dated 14 May <Col N="264"/>2004, and Council Decision 2004/496/EC, dated 17 May 2004, should be annulled on the grounds that neither decision has an appropriate basis in European law.</P>

	<P>My Department is responsible for visa applications to our missions abroad. Since January 2006, visa applications made in Ireland are the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Visa applications received abroad, and subsequently referred to Dublin, are decided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>All of our missions abroad are committed to reducing the response times for visa applicants. In recent years, dedicated visa officers have been assigned to the embassies in Moscow, Beijing and New Delhi to facilitate the processing of applications speedily, and this is being further expanded. Delegated sanction authority to missions on applications has been extended and has helped to reduce response times. Further improvements, including a new visa IT system, AVATS, are at an advanced stage of planning. The AVATS system will permit detailed tracking of an individual application from the point of receipt until its completion.</P>
        <P>Visas are issued in missions, including honorary consulates, all over the world. While statistics are not available on overall average response times, the Department is committed to trying to improve its service, including response times, to the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Employment rights legislation makes no distinction as between Irish and migrant workers. To avoid doubt on this, section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time) Work Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book applies to workers posted to work in Ireland in line with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 1996.</P>
        <P>This directive relates to the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and applies also to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employ<Col N="270"/>ment. Thus, all employee legislation applies to migrant workers recruited by employment agencies to work in Ireland under a contract of employment.</P>
        <P>The employment rights compliance section of the Department, which includes the labour inspectorate, applies the same principles in the discharge of its functions and, accordingly, makes no distinction as between Irish and migrant workers when undertaking compliance checking or investigating complaints. Where possible, the inspectorate will investigate any specific matters brought to its attention once they fall within its powers and remit. There are limitations, however, to what the inspectorate can reasonably achieve. Such limitations arise, for instance, where there are concerns regarding activities that occur outside Irish jurisdiction, and particularly outside the EU. The Internet is another area where there is little capacity to address concerns unless there is an Irish-based representative who can be contacted and influenced.</P>
        <P>Arising from the Government&rsquo;s commitments under Sustaining Progress, a review of the Employment Agency Act 1971 is taking place. As part of this process, in June 2005, the Department issued a White Paper on the review of the Act. The deadline for submissions was 15 July 2005. A total of nine submissions were received. The Department is examining these submissions.</P>
        <P>This Bill will, <i>inter alia</i>, propose a system of registration of employment agencies based in Ireland, supported by an industry regulatory code which will set out in detail, the practices and standards that employment agencies would be expected to follow.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the caveats mentioned earlier, I urge anyone who has evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The aims of the Seveso II Directive, <Col N="271"/>Council Directive 96/82/EC, which is transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Control of Major Accidents Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000, S.I. No. 476/2000, as amended by Council Directive 2003/105/EC, which will soon be transposed, are to prevent major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, and to limit the adverse human and environmental consequences where accidents do occur.</P>
        <P>Under the directive, one of the means of achieving these aims is ensuring that land-use policies take account of the need to maintain appropriate distances around establishments which process or store dangerous substances. The Health and Safety Authority, under the terms of these regulations, provides technical advice in the interest of safety to the planning authorities.</P>
        <P>The planning authorities are the major decision makers in regard to the siting of plants which fall under the terms of the regulations and the subsequent granting of permission for additional developments. All plants affected by the directives are subject to the planning process, which in itself has an appeals process built in and is transparent. Likewise, property owners whose land use may be restricted or otherwise affected by a proposed plant are entitled to avail of the planning and appeal process.</P>
        <P>However, the Planning and Development Act 2000, No. 30 of 2000, provides that compensation under section 190 of that Act shall not be payable in respect of the refusal of permission for any proposed development which (a) could, due to the risk of a major accident or if a major accident were to occur, lead to serious danger to human health or the environment, or (b) is in an area where it is necessary to limit the risk of there being any serious danger to human health or the environment.</P>
        <P>The special areas of conservation referred to in the question are designated under the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, which is within the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Compensation is available in some cases where there is a prohibition on the continuation of economic activity which has been carried out on land which is subsequently designated as a special area of conservation. There is no compensation available for a prohibition of any possible future economic use of such land.</P>

	<P>The enterprise development programme is a new programme set up in association with the L&iacute;onra network of third-level institutions, Athlone IT, GMIT, Sligo IT, Letterkenny IT, NUI Galway and St. Angela&rsquo;s College. This programme, supported by Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S, is based on the enterprise platform programme already in place in the south east. The aim of the enterprise development programme is to increase the number of start-up businesses in the midlands, west and north-west regions by providing a tailored programme of supports to assist eligible participants to develop business ideas which can be spun out as knowledge-based companies to provide jobs and export sales.</P>
        <P>The south-east enterprise platform programme is run at the Waterford Institute of Technology, with support from Tipperary Institute, Enterprise Ireland and the county and city enterprise boards. In the 2004-05 programme, six of the 25 graduates were funded by Enterprise Ireland. The 2005-06 programme commenced on 19 September 2005 with 20 candidates participating in the programme, six of which have been approved for Enterprise Ireland support to date. Graduates are expected to go on to set up new businesses in the region following the programme.</P>
        <P>The enterprise platform programme is a one-year rapid incubation programme designed to provide hands-on support and management development for entrepreneurs who wish to start their own business. Enterprise Ireland is a partner with the Department of Education and Science and the colleges in this initiative. It provides funding, under its business development grant under the Enterprise Ireland campus enterprise commercialisation fund, for eligible participants to attend the programme and develop business ideas which can be spun out as knowledge-based companies to provide jobs and export sales.</P>

        <P>The business park is a Shannon Development-owned land bank, comprising <i>circa</i> 227 acres. The <Col N="274"/>site has been identified as an important site from a business and employment perspective for both the county and region in the planning and land use transportation study, the mid-west regional planning guidelines and the county development plan. The investment projects which IDA Ireland seeks to win will be in more advanced higher-value, sophisticated activities, both manufacturing and services, often related to research activities, requiring high-level skills, infrastructure and business services generating more high-value products, services and jobs. That reflects the changing nature of FDI, whose primary needs can be summarised as follows: a high-quality urban environment with a critical mass in population; world-class access infrastructure, for example road access to key cities and ports and international airports; telecommunications infrastructure with multiple carriers and competitive pricing with business support services; third level educational infrastructure, including universities and technical colleges that are located on or close to business and technology parks; a range of affordable, state-of-the-art property solutions with the necessary infrastructure to support their activities.</P>
        <P>The Askeaton site is been actively marketed through IDA&rsquo;s network of overseas offices as a solution for utility-intensive projects. The development and servicing of the business park as a solution for such large-scale infrastructure-intensive projects is an ongoing project for Shannon Development, drawing on the experience of IDA in the development of similar sites in other locations, for example Oranmore, County Galway and Grangecastle, County Dublin. Ultimately, however, decisions regarding where to locate a project are taken by investors, based on the ability of the locations to support their business needs.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including available property solutions, for new or expanded FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is actively marketing the new industrial park in Tuam to potential investors on an ongoing basis. While IDA Ireland has succeeded in attracting five site visits to the town since January 2003, there have been no site visits as yet in 2006. Ultimately, decisions regarding <Col N="275"/>where to locate a project, including what locations to visit, are taken by the investors.</P>
        <P>Prospective investors looking at Ireland are often willing to consider only larger centres that have the scale, infrastructure and services capable of sustaining their investment. In an effort to enhance the attractiveness of the town of Tuam for additional investment and jobs, IDA Ireland informs me that: a total of &euro;3.5 million has been invested in the industrial park to date; planning permission has been obtained for the construction of a 20,000 sq. ft. advanced technology building, two 7,500 sq. ft. and two 5,000 sq. ft. advance technology units on the park; the agency is actively working with its existing base of overseas companies in the county and the Tuam area to encourage them to grow and expand; the agency is also working with local groups, utility-providers and other agencies to ensure that the county secures the appropriate infrastructure that will support existing companies to grow and develop and generally to enhance the attractiveness of the area for new projects.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland will in time bear fruit in additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Tuam.</P>

	<P>The company concerned announced to its staff on 31 January last that it would cease operations in Carrick-on-Suir with the loss of 53 jobs. Some 11 permanent staff will be transferred to new offices in Waterford city and will be retained in distribution support activities and finance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The IDA strategy for South Tipperary is to concentrate future economic development in Clonmel by developing the town as a first-class location for overseas investment. That strategy has been agreed with the south Tipperary county development board, and the agency&rsquo;s plans were outlined to Carrick-on-Suir Town Council last year. Carrick-on-Suir needs to link into the economic growth centres of Clonmel and Waterford, as there will be knock-on benefits in sectors such as distribution and transport, thus creating further investment and employment opportunities for people in surrounding areas, including Carrick-on-Suir.</P><Col N="276"/>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland provided support in 1998 for the setting up of an enterprise centre in Carrick-on-Suir. That centre has been sold to a private developer, and the proceeds of that sale have been invested in a new community resource centre for the town. The community enterprise centre is now incorporated into a state-of-the-art resource centre.</P>
        <P>The unemployment rate for the south east, according to the latest quarterly national household survey, is 6.7%. The latest CSO live register analysis shows that the number of those claiming unemployment benefit in Carrick-on-Suir was fairly static &mdash; 890 people in December 2005, as against 893 in December 2004. I met a delegation from Carrick-on-Suir Town Council last year and, following a meeting with F&Aacute;S, the agency agreed to increase its level of engagement with the long-term unemployed in the town.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I can assure you that the State development agencies, under the auspices of my Department, will continue to work closely together with the county development board, as well as participating in the special working groups set up in October 2004 by the county manager of south Tipperary to deal with job creation issues in the area, including Carrick-on-Suir. Should any further co-ordination be required, I consider that the county development board and the special working groups on which the State agencies are represented would be the appropriate fora to fulfil this function.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Competitiveness Council in its annual competitiveness report 2005 found that of the 16 countries benchmarked, Irish expenditure on non-life insurance was the fourth-highest. However, the NCC also found that the rate of growth in the cost of insurance has slowed down substantially in recent years. That can be attributed to the series of initiatives that the Government has pushed through to reform the insurance sector. The action taken by Government to ensure healthy competition in the insurance sector had already seen benefits for consumers.</P>
        <P>Sub-indices calculated from the all-items consumer price index at mid December 2005 show that since the insurance reform programme began in October 2002, there has been a reduction of 25% in car insurance.</P>
        <P>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which was one of the key initiatives of the <Col N="277"/>Government&rsquo;s insurance reform programme, published its first annual report on 13 September 2005. That shows that PIAB assessments to date have been delivered approximately three times faster and at a delivery charge four times cheaper than under the litigation system. As well as being of major benefit to victims of accidents, that is a significant reduction in the cost to insurance companies for the delivery of compensation and hence facilitates reductions in insurance premia.</P>
        <P>Supervision of insurance undertakings is the responsibility of the Financial Regulator, formerly known as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The Financial Regulator has a wide regulatory remit, covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all of the financial services industry, including insurance, and the services provided by it.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator comes under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>Part 3 of the Competition Act 2002 is designed to regulate mergers and acquisitions in the economy, including the retail sector of the economy, to ensure that there is no significant lessening of competition in the market.</P>
        <P>Under the merger provisions in the Act, parties to mergers and acquisitions that exceed the specified financial thresholds must notify their proposals to the Competition Authority in advance for regulatory clearance.</P>
        <P>Mergers or acquisitions which fall below the specified thresholds may be voluntarily notified to the authority for <i>ex-ante</i> clearance so that parties can be assured that their transaction will not be subject to <i>ex-poste</i> proceedings by the authority under section 4 or 5 of the Act.</P>

	<P>Competition is the life-blood of a vibrant economy, and the Government is committed to removing unwarranted constraints on competition in all sectors of the economy, including the retail sector.</P>
        <P>The retail grocery sector has seen significant changes in recent years, particularly since the entry of discounters Aldi and Lidl. There have been other developments too, such as the opening of 24-hour outlets by food retailers and the stocking of more non-food items to facilitate the way people live today.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to see that many Irish firms have faced up to this increasing competition by investing further in their operations and opening more new stores. Such investment is important for improving the services and choices available to Irish consumers. The mix of retail outlets has created a situation where local and international players now coexist in a dynamic marketplace.</P>
        <P>However, price competition in the retail grocery sector has been constrained for many years by the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987, which prohibits the sale of grocery goods at below net invoice price. That prohibition has had the effect of keeping prices artificially high.</P>
        <P>However, one of the main provisions of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005, which I recently brought before the Oireachtas, is to revoke the groceries order. I expect that once the order has been repealed, we will see greater competition in the retail grocery sector and that prices will reflect that increased competition in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 331 to 333, inclusive together.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s economy continued to perform exceptionally well in 2005. GNP grew by approximately 5%, compared with an OECD average of 2.7% for last year. The recently published NCB purchasing managers&rsquo; index showed that the Irish manufacturing sector maintained solid growth in output and new business in January. Last year, according to the CSO&rsquo;s latest quarterly national household survey, employment reached 1.99 million in the third quarter of 2005. What is particularly reassuring is that the employment growth was recorded across all sectors of the economy, including the manufacturing sector.</P>
        <P>The Government has a strong record of taking decisive actions to ensure that our enterprise environment remains attractive. The introduction of a third consecutive non-inflationary budget in 2006, the abolition of the groceries order, the successful reform of the insurance sector and the increased resources of the Competition Authority are all testament to the Government&rsquo;s determination to safeguard our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>However, despite our continued economic success, we cannot afford to become complacent. Maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has been and will continue to be a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s economic policy. The Government gives careful consideration to the advice of the National Competitiveness Council, which is charged with monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and suggesting recommendations to enhance it. The enterprise advisory group, which I established last year to oversee the implementation of the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s recommendations continues to make good progress and is expected to submit its first periodic report to the Government later this year.</P>
        <P>Our future prosperity depends on our ability to attract and retain the higher value-added operations that are an essential component in any knowledge-based economy. I am reassured by recent data that last year there was a strong upward trend in Irish research and development performance. We also need to improve our productivity performance to ensure our continued competitiveness. To achieve that, Enterprise Ireland has a &euro;20 million productivity improvement fund, which aims to assist Irish enterprises in their drive for higher efficiency and international competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Finally, I have no doubt that the competitiveness imperative will be a critical overarching issue that will need to be taken into account by the various stakeholders in the up-coming social partnership discussions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The company in question has undertaken a major restructuring and upgrading of its plant in Naas, County Kildare. Although the restructuring involved 245 redundancies, the company has chosen Ireland as the international manufacturing site for its next generation of products, involving substantial capital investment at its plant. Those workers who lost their jobs are highly skilled workers, and Enterprise Ireland anticipates that some of the former employees will avail themselves of the supports provided by Enterprise Ireland to develop their own technology-based businesses. In addition, F&Aacute;S is also assisting the affected workers to plan new careers, identify training needs and secure alternative employment.</P>
        <P>The industrial development agencies continue to market Naas for investment and job creation. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with their client companies with a view to supporting such companies with potential investment and expansion or diversification of activities that would strengthen their presence in Naas.</P>
        <P>County Kildare has in recent years attracted some world-class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Wyeth Medica, Braun Oral B and Hewlett Packard. In addition, on 5 May last, I performed the official opening of International Fund Services (Ireland) Limited&rsquo;s office in Naas. That facility is on target to employ 240 people by the end of 2006. The announcement last year by Green Isle Foods of a &euro;22.6 million expansion investment, supported by Enterprise Ireland, which is now under way, will lead to the creation of 130 additional jobs in Naas, from a current base of 630.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the strategies and policies being pursued by the industrial development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, will continue to maximise sustainable job creation and investment opportunities in Naas and the surrounding area.</P>

	<P>Self-employed workers generally pay class S contributions. The class at which contributions are paid and the number paid establishes the range of benefits and pensions towards which a contributor can build up entitlement.

        <P>Liability to social insurance contributions for self-employed persons is primarily determined by reference to reckonable income, as assessed in accordance with income tax provisions. The child-minding relief, announced by the Minister for Finance in budget 2006, would allow an individual to supervise up to three children other than his or her own at home and exempts all related child-minding earnings, up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 per annum, from tax, social insurance and levy payments. Where child-minding income exceeds &euro;10,000, the respective total amount earned by the minder would be taxable as normal under self-assessment procedures.</P>

        <P>Having regard to the new circumstances of the case, the HSE decided that the person concerned no longer satisfied the qualification criteria for SWA, as it too considered the person not to be genuinely seeking employment. Accordingly, payment of his basic SWA and rent supplement claims was terminated. The person concerned subsequently appealed that decision to the designated appeals officer in the HSE, but the decision was upheld by the appeals officer.</P>
        <P>If the person in question is not satisfied with the decision of the HSE appeals officer, he may appeal that decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>Subject to certain conditions, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs and who do not have accommodation available from any other source. Rent supplement is a short-term income maintenance support and is not intended to address a person&rsquo;s long-term accommodation needs.</P>
        <P>Article 9(2)(<i>d</i>) of SI 382 of 1995 provides that a rent supplement shall not be payable in circumstances where a person has vacated accommodation provided by a housing authority, unless the Health Service Executive is satisfied that he or she had good cause for doing so. Article 31 of SI 382 of 1995 provides that the Health Service Executive may award a supplement, including a rent supplement, in any case where it appears to the executive that the circumstances of the case so warrant.</P>
        <P>In making a decision regarding a rent supplement claim, the executive considers all the facts and supporting documentation presented to <Col N="284"/>it, and every case is decided on the basis of its own individual circumstances. Neither I nor my Department has any function regarding decisions on individual claims.</P>
        <P>Where a person claims good cause for leaving local authority accommodation, the factors considered by the executive in making its determination include the stated reason for leaving the accommodation, validated evidence to support the stated reason and the availability of an alternative housing solution, including alternative local authority accommodation.</P>
        <P>Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of the executive regarding a claim for rent supplement, that decision may be appealed to the designated appeals officer in the executive. Where the person is not satisfied with the decision of the HSE appeals officer, the decision may be further appealed to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, SWA, is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, HSE. Neither I nor my Department has any function in relation to decisions on individual claims or in the role of the executive&rsquo;s appeals process.</P>
        <P>Where a person is dissatisfied with the outcome of an application for SWA he or she may appeal against the decision to the appeals officer in the relevant HSE area and if necessary then to the chief appeals officer of the social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The timescale for completing an appeal from the date of receipt to the communication of a determination is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, information from landlords etc. The person who originally made the decision may be <Col N="285"/>asked to review the case in the light of any additional information supplied in relation to the appeal.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the total number of SWA appeals for 2005 was 6,305. It has further advised that, in general, the period for the completion of the SWA appeals process in the HSE is 21 to 28 days, however, cases of greater complexity require a longer period. The HSE was unable to provide statistics for each Health Service Executive area on the length of delays in deciding appeals.</P>

The person concerned has appealed the decision to the designated appeals officer in the Health Service Executive. A decision on the matter is expected shortly.</P>

	<P>The total number of persons on the live register as of end January 2006 is 160,100. The live register comprises 64,100 people receiving unemployment benefit, 86,100 receiving unemployment assistance and 9,900 signing for credits. Based on the seasonally adjusted live register of 157,400 and using CSO methodology, the estimated standardised unemployment rate for end January 2006 is 4.3%.</P>
        <P>A number of measures were announced in the 2006 budget to assist social welfare recipients return to work. These include the reduction in the periods required to access the back to work scheme. I have reduced the period required to access the self employed strand of the scheme from three to two years for people on unemployment payments and from five to two years for the employee strand. I have also introduced a 50% tapered withdrawal of earnings between &euro;60 and &euro;90 per week for rent and mortgage interest supplement.</P>
        <P>My Department also administers the back to education allowance programme. This is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the work force. There were 7,308 participants in the scheme for the 2004-05 year.</P>
        <P>My Department maintains ongoing contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in developing policies and enhancing programmes to encourage and assist unemployed people to return to work. Under the national employment plan, unemployed customers aged 18 to 55 years are referred to F&Aacute;S for guidance in terms of returning to education, training or employment. The plan was recently reviewed by independent consultants and I have asked my officials, in conjunction with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and F&Aacute;S, to review the recommendations.</P>

It benefits farm families with children and also provides increased payments to farming couples without children and to single farmers on low income.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 and 349 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Government decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004, my Department is to relocate 230 posts to Donegal town and 120 posts to Buncrana.</P>
        <P>The decentralisation implementation group, DIG, report to the Minister for Finance on 19 November 2004, recommended those locations and organisations to be included in the first phase of moves, and those to be regarded as potential early movers.</P>
        <P>In the case of my Department, Sligo and Drogheda were included in the first phase and Carrick-on-Shannon was recommended as a location to be considered as an early mover.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The DIG progress report to the Minister for Finance on 30 June 2005 outlined the indicative construction start and completion dates for all locations and organisations not included in the first phase of the programme. According to the report, the indicative construction start date for Donegal town is the end of 2007 and the construction completion date is mid-2009. The corresponding dates for Buncrana are the end of 2007 and early 2009.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works, OPW, has been charged with securing accommodation in the decentralised locations. My Department has been advised by OPW that a suitable site has been identified in Donegal town and a site has been purchased in Buncrana.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Public Appointments Service established the Central Applications Facility, CAF, through which all applications for decentralising locations must be submitted. According to figures received in my Department from the CAF, the number of applicants for Donegal town and Buncrana is 107 and 34 respectively. The number of applicants serving in my Department is 40 for Donegal town and 17 for Buncrana. The CAF will remain open for new applications until the full decentralisation programme is complete.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that for the first time in nine years participants on the Moving On programme (details supplied) are having their training allowance assessed for rent supplement and that a disregard of &euro;60 is being applied; his plans to change same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance <Col N="290"/>scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Neither I nor my Department has any function in relation to decisions on individual claims.</P>
        <P>Under the rules of the scheme, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person after the payment of rent has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. Where a person has an additional income as a result of participation on a F&Aacute;S training course, such as the Moving On programme, the means test provides for a weekly disregard of up to &euro;60 per week and for half of any additional income between &euro;60 and &euro;90 to be disregarded for means assessment purposes. This type of additional income disregard was first introduced in budget 2000 and has been increased over the years to its current level. The current arrangements are designed to ensure that people have a financial incentive to take up training opportunities.</P>

	<P>Disability allowance is a means-tested social assistance payment which is paid to people with a disability who are substantially handicapped in undertaking work which would otherwise be suitable for a person of their age, experience and qualifications.</P>
        <P>The right of a person to retain a social security payment when moving to another member state is governed by national legislation and EU social security regulations. While social insurance based payments can be paid when a person moves to another member state, payments which are classified by EU regulations as being &ldquo;special non-contributory benefits&rdquo; are not generally payable outside the State.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of the EU social security regulations, disability allowance is classified as a special non-contributory benefit and accordingly is not payable outside Ireland. The only exception to this is in circumstances where the person is receiving medical treatment in a hospital abroad, in which case payment of disability allow<Col N="291"/>ance may continue for the duration of such treatment.</P>

While the directive&rsquo;s provisions do not become compulsory until 26 January 2007, and then only in relation to new vehicles, I have sought to have these higher standard mirrors fitted to existing HGVs on a voluntary basis. In that regard, in April 2005, the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation were requested to consider advising their members to retrofit vehicles with blind spot mirrors or indirect vision devices. SIMI was also asked that, in advance of the 26 January 2007 deadline for new vehicles, all new HGVs being put on the market meet the higher standards required by Directive 2003/97/EC.</P>
        <P>It is only after 26 January 2007 when the fitting of such mirrors on HGVs becomes mandatory that it would be possible to check vehicles for these mirrors during the annual roadworthiness test.</P><Col N="292"/>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Traffic Signs Manual, published in 1996, incorporates the design of all of the traffic signs that can be deployed on public roads and guidance and advice in relation to the use of such signs.</P>
        <P>Traffic signs can be generally divided into three distinct groupings. These are regulatory signs, warning signs and information signs. While the manual provides depictions of regulatory signs, the statutory basis for such signs is established in regulations made by the Minister under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. For the purpose of warning and information signs, the manual constitutes a direction given by the Minister under section 95(16) of the 1961 Act, which provides the legislative basis for the design and use of non-regulatory traffic signs generally.</P>
        <P>Work on updating the manual commenced in late 2004. A draft of a new chapter 8 of the manual, which relates to traffic signs at roadworks, is currently the subject of a consultation process involving all road authorities. This chapter will be finalised following consideration of submissions received and it is proposed that it will be completed by mid-year. Work on the remaining chapters is progressing and it is intended that drafts of updated chapters will be made available for consultation with road authorities between this and the end of the year. I expect therefore that the updated manual will be ready to be published <Col N="298"/>in early 2007. As is the case with the current manual, the new publication will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The proposals made by Dublin City Council would require changes to parking regulations and the designation of new signs or, alternatively, a revision of the application and status of existing signs. As the council has been advised, its proposal is being considered in the context of the development of the chapters in the traffic signs manual concerning regulatory signs. If it is considered appropriate to adopt the suggestion made by the council, it will have to be supported by provisions in both traffic and parking regulations made under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and traffic signs regulations made under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1996.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 3311/06, which I answered in the House on Wednesday, 1 February 2006. As I have indicated to this House previously, the delay in providing driving tests is a matter of regret to me. It not only represents a poor service to the public but it is also hampering the development of initiatives I wish to pursue and which will contribute further to road safety.</P><Col N="299"/>
        <P>The driving test and those who deliver it constitute a key element in the road safety strategy. It is my objective to eliminate the backlog of driving tests by mid-2007 and my Department has developed a package of measures in consultation with staff interests to achieve this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am pleased to acknowledge that a high number of existing driver testers have indicated that they will participate in a bonus scheme, which will make a significant contribution to the reduction of the backlog over the coming 18 months. Furthermore, in a unique cross-departmental and cross-union agreement, a further eight civil servants from the Department of Agriculture and Food have successfully passed interviews and tests. They will shortly be trained as driver testers and will start working in April to reduce the backlog. Later in the year, they will be augmented by another ten new recruits on two-year contracts. This increased volume of testing is putting administrative staff in Ballina under considerable pressure and I want publicly to recognise the contribution they are making to resolve a difficult situation. They are often the first point of contact between the public and the Department in difficult times and they have responded admirably.</P>
        <P>However, despite all these efforts I am convinced that more needs to be done in the short term and that the temporary use of outsourcing must be an option to which I have recourse. Outsourcing not only provides access to additional staff resources but also to training options and to infrastructure and facilities that are needed to overcome the problems we face in the coming months. Sustaining Progress provides that option but there is union disagreement on this. I accept that this disagreement reflects a genuinely held difference of opinion on the meaning of clauses in Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>Departmental and union officials have worked hard together to reach solutions and, although good progress has been made, I do not think it is sufficient to overcome the overriding need to eliminate the backlog as quickly as possible and to allow those same staff to concentrate on developing and implementing a road safety regime and services which are part of this Government&rsquo;s programme.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P>Therefore, I intend to progress the outsourcing option. I understand that this decision is likely to be tested under the arbitration provisions of Sustaining Progress. If so, that will give both sides a binding decision. Meanwhile, I have mandated my Department to progress outsourcing. I strongly believe that this is a prudent decision which it is necessary to take in the interests of road safety and to avoid any unnecessary subsequent delays in eliminating the backlog.</P>
        <P>I want to be unequivocally clear to the staff in the Department that I appreciate the level of service and commitment they have given and continue to give to the delivery of a driver testing service. They will continue to be the backbone of the service in future. While I believe that outsourcing is needed now in exceptional circumstances to augment their work, I can give them an assurance that it is a temporary measure and not intended to replace their work. I can also assure them that if outsourcing points to deficiencies in the infrastructure or systems which are available in the public service, I intend to continue to secure and provide the resources needed to improve the public service infrastructure. In tandem with eliminating the backlog, I am determined to support a better public service delivery of the driving test to the benefit of both customers and staff. Along with eliminating the backlog I intend to deliver a service in which existing staff will be proud to work.</P>

	<P>At present, transport officers are executive officers in my Department who receive an allowance for carrying out specific duties. To date, vacancies have been filled by confined competition within my Department. However, under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, executive <Col N="302"/>officers who applied under the Central Applications Facility, CAF, may be offered positions as transport officers and will be headquartered in Loughrea. Once the road safety authority is established, transport officers will be part of the staff of that organisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not expect external vacancies to arise in the short term but if they do, recruitment will be carried out by the Public Appointments Service. At present, interested parties for executive officer positions can register through the public appointments website, <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>. Once registered, the applicant is notified automatically when a competition is announced.</P>

Having assessed the application, the single payment entitlements unit informed the person named that the circumstances outlined did not fulfill the<i> force majeure</i> criteria laid down in article 40 of Council Regulation, EC no. 1782/2003. The person named then appealed this decision to the single payment appeals committee which upheld this decision.</P>

These flatworms are predators of earthworms and there is no control method other than trapping and physically destroying them. As they do not affect plants or vector plant diseases they are not covered by plant health legislation that comes within the remit of my Department. There was a considerable fear that as their populations spread to agricultural land that there would be serious consequences for earthworm populations. However, research and monitoring carried out in Northern Ireland and Britain indicates that while flatworm populations are established the feared effects have not occurred. Nevertheless our advice is still to destroy flatworms where they are found. My staff check for the presence of these <Col N="305"/>pests while carrying out plant health inspections of third country material.</P>

	<P>My Department was aware, from an early stage in the negotiations leading to the introduction of the single payment scheme, of the possible implications for retired farmers who had leased their holdings. In so far as it proved possible in the context of the EU regulations governing the single payment scheme, and following lengthy discussions with the European Commission, provision was made under the rules of the single payment scheme to address some of the concerns of retired farmers.</P>
        <P>As participants in the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming had retired before the start of the reference period in 2000, they are not in a position to claim entitlements under the single payment scheme. However, following agreement with the European Commission, a special category has been included in the national reserve for farmers who inherit or otherwise receive land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who retired or died before 16 May 2005 where the land in question was leased to a third party during the reference period. This will benefit the family members of retired farmers who decide to take up farming. Only landholders actively engaged in farming can receive entitlements from the national reserve. A separate category, category A, has been included in the 2005 national reserve application form to cater for this group, and I hope to apply similar arrangements under the 2006 and subsequent years&rsquo; national reserve.</P>

In so far as it proved possible in the context of the EU regulations governing the single payment scheme, and following lengthy discussions with the European Commission, provision was made under the rules of the single payment scheme to address some of the concerns of retired farmers. It was open to participants in the current early retirement scheme, who would have farmed during part or all of the reference period, to activate entitlements in 2005 and lease them to their existing transferee. If the transferee did not want the entitlements, the transferor or retired farmer who has already activated the entitlements has until 2007 either to lease the entitlements or transfer them, with land, to another farmer.</P>

	<P>It is a requirement of the EU Council Regulations (2079/92 and 1257/99) under which the 1994 and 2000 early retirement schemes were introduced that the early retirement pension can be paid only as a supplement to any national retirement pension that the participant, and his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, receive. This means that the value of any national retirement pension payable must be deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has been determined in consultation with the European Commission that the following pensions are national retirement pensions &mdash; old age contributory pension, old-age non-contributory pension, widow-widower&rsquo;s contributory pension, widow-widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension. A national retirement pension may comprise a personal allowance, an adult dependant allowance, child dependant allowances and a living alone allowance. The total amount payable constitutes the national retirement pension, as a spouse and children do not have independent entitlement to the pension. Therefore, it is the total amount of the national retirement pension that must be deducted from the early retirement pension and not just the personal rate.</P>

	<P>The original entitlements of the person named under the single payment scheme amounted to &euro;17,046.91 but this figure increased to &euro;26,660.47 when the decoupled dairy premium was allocated to him. Payment was issued to the applicant on 1 December 2005.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the first instance. The regulations to give legal effect to the nitrates action programme were signed by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government last December and came into effect on 1 February 2006.</P>
        <P>Last month, Teagasc, the State body responsible for providing the science on which the technical aspects of the regulations are based, indicated that it may be possible to review part of this advice in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations, particularly with regard to phosphorus usage. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I have made it clear that, if scientifically robust <Col N="316"/>information can be brought forward, then the Government will make a case to the European Commission for revising the current limits.</P>
        <P>As a result of these developments, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced that the implementation of Part 3 of the regulations, dealing with nutrient planning, will be deferred for a number of weeks. Any amendments required to the regulations will be made following completion of the review and will require the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>I have previously outlined a number of important measures that my own Department has taken to alleviate the impact of the nitrates regulations on the farming sector. The Sustaining Progress agreement included a number of commitments related to the nitrates directive and these have all been delivered in the form of improvements to the farm waste management scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme and substantially increased REPS payments. In addition, EU approval is now being sought for further substantial improvements to the farm waste management scheme.</P>

	<P>The Adoptive Leave Acts 1995 and 2005 provide for a leave entitlement, similar to maternity leave, to adopting mothers after the placement of a child into their care. The provisions of the Acts are modelled on existing arrangements for natural mothers. Adoptive leave entitlement also applies to sole male adopters and, in exceptional circumstances, to adopting fathers in the event of the death of the adopting mother.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Acts provide for 16 weeks adoptive leave attracting payment and an optional eight weeks additional unpaid adoptive leave. In the case of foreign adoptions, some or all of the eight weeks additional unpaid leave may be taken prior to the date of placement of the child with the adoptive parent or parents. In the interests of maintaining the parity of entitlements between adopting and natural mothers, the increases to maternity leave announced in the context of budget 2006 have been applied by me by order to adoptive leave. Paid adoptive leave will be increased to 20 weeks on 1 March 2006 and to 24 weeks on 1 March 2007, while unpaid adoptive leave will be <Col N="318"/>increased to 12 weeks on 1 March 2006 and to 16 weeks on 1 March 2007.</P>
        <P>The Adoptive Leave Act 2005, which was commenced on 28 November 2005, amended the 1995 Act to improve the existing adoptive leave provisions in line with the new maternity leave provisions contained in the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004. The main provisions of the Adoptive Leave Act 2005 are provision for an increase in the adoptive leave period by two weeks to 16 weeks &mdash; already implemented by ministerial order effective from 19 November 2004 &mdash; provision for adopting parent or parents to attend required preparation classes and pre-adoption meetings with social workers-health board officials during work hours without loss of pay, provision for termination of additional adoptive leave in the event of illness, subject to the agreement of the employer, and provision to split the period of adoptive leave-additional adoptive leave in the event of the hospitalisation of the child, subject to the agreement of the employer.</P>

        <P>Having given full consideration to the matter, the visa was refused because my Department was not satisfied, on the basis of documentation provided, that an adequate relationship history existed between the applicant and the reference in Ireland. In particular, the visa officer noted that the couple has been introduced during February 2005 by a friend and married in July 2005. The visa officer could not be reasonably satisfied that a previous relationship history existed between the applicant and the reference in Ireland.

	<P>An examination for promotion from the prison officer grade to the assistant chief officer grade was held over a number of days in 2000. Following numerous representations and complaints from concerned parties, the view was taken that the results from stage one of the exam may have been compromised. Arising out of this conclusion, a decision was taken to allow all prison officers who presented themselves for stage one of the exam to proceed through to stage two. A panel was formed using the results from stage two of the exam.</P>
        <P>As the exam in 2000 was not cancelled, no cancellation costs were involved. However, a number of prison officers instigated legal proceedings to prevent appointments from the panel. Following a judicial review, judgment was made in favour of the Irish Prison Service, which was permitted to proceed with promotions from the panel. Sub<Col N="321"/>sequently, costs were awarded to the Irish Prison Service and, as is its policy in these matters, it is currently pursuing recovery of its costs.</P>
        <P>On 6 December 2005, 310 prison officers were scheduled to sit a competency based exam as part one of the promotion process to assistant chief officer, which was out sourced to a firm of occupational psychologists. Two sessions were held in two centres, Dublin and Portlaoise. Two parallel versions of the same test were used in each location, with different versions applied in the morning and afternoon. However, following the identification of two errors on paper two of the afternoon session, that session was aborted. The errors did not affect the correct answer but apparently caused some anxiety among those officers sitting the exam in Dublin. The officers in the Portlaoise centre completed the test without drawing the attention of the invigilators to the errors on the exam. The invigilators in the Dublin centre took a unilateral decision to abort the test in their centre and contacted their counterparts in Portlaoise requesting them to do the same. The decision was taken in the absence of consultation with the Irish Prison Service.</P>
        <P>Arrangements have been put in place to reschedule the remaining parts of the exams for the 143 officers who sat the second version of the exam that contained the errors. Only the officers who participated in the afternoon sessions of the exam were scheduled to sit the affected parts &mdash; papers two and three &mdash; of the exam again on Friday, 3 February 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of the financial costs, 50% of the design and delivery of the exam process was paid to the firm of occupational psychologists prior to the date of the test. The question of future payments and liability for the additional costs consequent on the cancelled examination is under discussion. While the inconvenience caused to all concerned is very much regretted, the Irish Prison Service, cognisant of the need for the timely provision of assistant chief officers to meet the requirements of the program for organisational change and having taken expert advice, believes that this is the fairest and most efficient way forward for all concerned. Appointments to the vacancies are expected to take place by late March or early April of this year.</P>

	<P>The person in question applied for permission to remain in Ireland on the basis of having an Irish born child prior to 1 January 2005, in accordance with the revised arrangements announced by me on 15 January 2005. It is a requirement under the revised arrangements that each applicant is resident with the child on a continuous basis since the child&rsquo;s birth and that evidence of such residence be provided with each application. The person in question has not provided satisfactory evidence of being continuously resident in the State since her child was born in July 2004. On this basis, her application for permission to remain was refused.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the area referred to is policed by garda&iacute; at Clontarf Garda station.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Garda management states that community policing is a central feature and core value in policing policy of local Garda management. Additional resources have been allocated to the community policing unit at Clontarf. An excellent partnership approach between garda&iacute; and the local community has evolved and addresses local issues of concern.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities have further informed me that current policing policy in the Clontarf sub-district is predicated on: the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime, particularly crimes of violence against persons and property; and the maintenance of an environment conductive to the improvement of the quality of life. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area served by Clontarf Garda station.</P>
        <P>Garda management also states that Operation Encounter, introduced by the Commissioner in 2002, addresses public disorder and anti-social behaviour by targeting offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 1988 and 2003. To date, in excess of 300,000 offences have been recorded. This operation is ongoing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Garda management further states that anti-social behaviour has been specifically targeted in <Col N="324"/>a number of divisional and district policing plans for 2006 and progress will be monitored by senior Garda management on an ongoing basis. Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are constantly monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 of my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>

	<P>The person in question, a Nigerian national, arrived in the State on 2 May 2005. She gave birth to a female child in the State on 3 July 2005. As the child in question was born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 she does not enjoy the right of automatic citizenship as applied to children born before that date.</P>
        <P>The person in question claimed asylum, subsequent to the child&rsquo;s birth, and indicated that she wished her daughter, a non-national born in Ireland, to be included in that claim. Her claim for asylum was refused by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and she was informed of that recommendation, which also applied to her dependant child named in her application, on 29 September 2005. The person concerned appealed this recommendation and her appeal was rejected by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which informed her of the decision by letter dated 29 December 2005. The letter also informed her that the decision applied to her dependant child named in the appeal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed by letter dated 9 January 2006 that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her daughter. She was, in accordance with the Act, given the options to be exercised within 15 working days, of, making representations to the Mini<Col N="325"/>ster setting out the reasons why she and her child should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before deportation orders were made; consenting to the making of deportation orders. Representations have been made to my Department requesting that the person concerned and her child be allowed to remain in the State. I expect the file to be submitted to me for decision shortly.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ennis is one of the 11 remaining locations nationwide which form part of the Garda CCTV programme. Following recommendations from the Garda authorities, I have approved the implementation of six new Garda CCTV systems. With the addition of these six new locations a total of 17 Garda town centre CCTV systems, including Ennis, will be implemented in Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated previously I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.</P>
        <P>In recent months the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has conducted a thorough examination of all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems. Following this review, I recently received a comprehensive and innovative proposal for the project management and the outsourced service provision of Garda CCTV systems, including Ennis, from the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities wish to commence the initial public procurement process and I am also anxious to proceed urgently with this comprehensive request for tender to source the best CCTV service possible for Ennis and the other 16 locations selected. This will happen in conjunction with the imminent commencement of section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV in public places. My Department is in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract the project man<Col N="326"/>agers and outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems.</P>
        <P>My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Ennis and in the other locations, at the earliest opportunity, subject to compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 421 to 423, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The internal departmental correspondence to which the Deputy refers, and which was released under the Freedom of Information Act, arose during the preparation of proposals to significantly widen eligibility for membership of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The background to this matter is that, in the context of the current major expansion of the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from 12,000 to 14,000, I recognised the need for the intake of Garda recruits to reflect the increasingly multi-ethnic and multicultural composition of Irish society. I took the view that the long-standing requirement for Garda recruits to hold an academic requirement in Irish was a barrier to this. I brought forward regulations, approved by Government and made on 12 September 2005, which replaced the requirement to hold a qualification in both Irish and English with a require<Col N="327"/>ment to hold a qualification in two languages, one of which must be Irish or English. Parallel measures were put in place to protect and promote the use of Irish in the force.</P>
        <P>In the preparation of these proposals and the related regulations, consideration was given by officials in my Department to any consequential changes relating to nationality or residence which might be required by a change in the language requirements. While the regulations on Garda recruitment had up to then been silent on the issue of nationality or residence, the requirement to hold a qualification in Irish had effectively limited entry to the force to Irish nationals. The removal of the Irish requirement therefore required this issue to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The consideration of this issue within my Department was thorough, and included an analysis of the potential benefits and disadvantages of different models of eligibility for membership of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, ranging from restricted models to liberal models. One issue was whether the competition should be opened to persons not resident in Ireland, that is, worldwide eligibility. The correspondence in question was one contribution to that debate. It was an entirely legitimate analysis of the undoubtedly large potential difficulties, including difficulties in checking the integrity of documentary evidence of qualifications, that could arise in an extension of eligibility worldwide.</P>
        <P>The argument against worldwide eligibility was accepted and the conclusion of the officials, and their advice to me, was that eligibility for membership of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be extended very widely to include all nationals of EU member states, EEA states and the Swiss confederation, and nationals of any other state who are lawfully resident in Ireland for five years. I accepted this proposal and it was included in the regulations. The result is that eligibility for membership of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now one of the most extensive and liberal among police forces internationally, to the benefit of the force and the society it serves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The national disability strategy, launched by the Government in September 2004, underpins the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society by building on existing policy and legislation. The key elements of the strategy are: the Disability Act 2005; the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill; the multi-annual investment programme; and the outline sectoral plans published by six Departments.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made to date in implementing the strategy. All sections of the Disability Act 2005 for which I have responsibility have been commenced, with the exception of Part 6 of the Act. Part 6 provides for the establishment of a centre for excellence in universal design in the National Disability Authority and will commence on 1 January 2007. The commencement of Part 2 of the Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children, in consultation with the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>Since 31 December 2005, public bodies, subject to certain considerations specified in the Disability Act 2005, must meet a number of legal requirements including: to ensure that the provision of access to their services by people with and without disabilities is integrated; to ensure that services and goods they are provided with are accessible to people with disabilities; to ensure that contents of the communications with people with disabilities are provided in an accessible format; to establish procedures in respect of the making and investigation of complaints from people with disabilities; to give effect to the provisions of the Act relating to the employment of people with disabilities; and to make their buildings accessible to people with disabilities by 31 December 2015.</P>
        <P>As part of the national disability strategy, outline sectoral plans were published on 21 September 2004 by the following Departments: Health and Children; Social and Family Affairs; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Transport; Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>Section 31 of the Act provides a statutory basis for the preparation and publication of these plans. The sectoral plans will set out for each of these Departments and the public bodies under their aegis the programme of measures to be taken concerning the provision of services for people with specified disabilities, and will contain information on complaints procedures and other matters.</P>
        <P>These plans are to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as possible but not later than one year after the commencement of the Act, that is, by 28 July 2006. The National Disability Authority has conducted a nationwide series of public consultation meetings on the draft <Col N="331"/>plans in conjunction with the Departments concerned. The implementation of the sectoral plans will be supported by a process of monitoring, reporting and review.</P>
        <P>In terms of the other elements of the national disability strategy, the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill will introduce a personal advocacy service geared towards people with disabilities in respect of applications for obtaining services. The Government&rsquo;s multi-annual investment programme for high priority disability support services is worth &euro;900 million and the programme will run until 2009.</P>
        <P>The preparation of the national disability strategy was guided by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and this committee will continue its monitoring role as the elements of the strategy are being put in place.</P>

I understand from the Dublin city coroner&rsquo;s office that in their experience it generally takes between three and six months for a post-mortem report to be received but that this may take longer where further specialist tests are required, for example, toxicology, histology and microbiology tests.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Castlebar is one of the 11 remaining locations nationwide which form part of the Garda CCTV programme. Following recommendations from the Garda authorities, I have approved the implementation of six new Garda CCTV systems. With the addition of these six new locations a total of 17 Garda town centre CCTV systems will be implemented in Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.</P>
        <P>As I indicated previously, I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.</P>
        <P>In recent months the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conducted a thorough examination of all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems. Following this review, I recently received a comprehensive and innovative proposal for the project management and the outsourced service provision of Garda CCTV systems, including Castlebar, from the Garda Commissioner. The Garda authorities wish to commence the initial public procurement process and I am also anxious to proceed urgently with this comprehensive request for tender to source the best CCTV service possible for Castlebar and the other 16 locations selected. This will happen in conjunction with the imminent commencement of section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na <Col N="333"/>Act 2005, which provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV in public places.</P>
        <P>My Department is in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract the project managers and outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems. My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Castlebar and in the other locations, at the earliest opportunity, subject to compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures. I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Ballina has been received by the CCTV advisory committee. This committee was established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on all matters relating to CCTV systems.</P>
        <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>This application is under consideration by the advisory committee along with applications from other cities and towns throughout the country. Two towns in County Mayo submitted proposals for grant aid under my Department&rsquo;s community based CCTV scheme. Applications for Stage 1 pre-development funding were received from Ballina CCTV steering committee and IRD Kiltimagh. No other applications were received from towns or communities in County Mayo. Applications for funding were thoroughly assessed against the criteria set out in the community based CCTV scheme application guidelines with a view to forming a list of projects suitable for funding under the scheme. All applications, including those recommended for funding by Pobal, were then considered by the community based CCTV project board, which is chaired by this Department, before I made a final decision on the matter.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P Just="Left">Following a thorough assessment of their application, IRD Kiltimagh&rsquo;s application for funding was deemed not to reach a high enough standard to be granted funding at this stage. I approved a pre-development grant of &euro;5,000 in respect of Ballina CCTV steering committee&rsquo;s application. I understand that Pobal recently provided feedback directly to all applicants under the scheme. It is intended to invite a new round of applications for funding under the community based CCTV scheme in the coming months, and it is, of course, open to any town in County Mayo to submit an application for funding at that stage.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area in question is regularly patrolled by uniform and detective units from Rathfarnham and Tallaght Garda stations with a view to ensuring a concentrated and visible Garda presence in the area. These patrols are backed up by garda&iacute; from the divisional crime task force based in Crumlin Garda station and the divisional traffic unit based in Terenure Garda station.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that in late 2005 an additional community garda, who liaises with the local community, was appointed full time to this area. In addition, community garda&iacute; have met with residents associations and discussed their concerns. I understand that garda&iacute; are aware of an increase in anti-social behaviour and burglaries in the area concerned. Individuals suspected of involvement in anti-social behaviour and committing burglaries are being targeted. In addition, Operation Anvil patrols also target this area.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the staffing levels of the Garda driving and training school are being examined. I should also say that the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The strength of the Garda traffic corps will be expanded over the next three years as set out in the following table:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The project to increase the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 is fully on target and will be achieved. The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. Clearly, of course, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

As a consequence, output in 2005 was up 49% on 2002 and the Land Registry was able to respond to the continued growth in applications arising from the extent of activity in the property sector.

Therefore, the number of live cases was 113,674.</P>
        <P>I can further inform the Deputy that the average waiting time is calculated by dividing the number of dealings on hand for each county by the average number completed monthly during 2005 for that county. The length of time taken to complete cases varies depending on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, investigation of title requirements, the completeness of the documentation presented, mapping requirements, the volume of business being transacted, the level of resources available at any particular time and the time at which the present computerised system was introduced in the Land <Col N="338"/>Registry Office for each county. Where a case is urgent and this is brought to the attention of the Land Registry Office, in accordance with its customer service policy, the matter is dealt with expeditiously.</P>

	<P>Legislation is being prepared in my Department which will create a specific offence of trafficking human beings into, through or out of Ireland for the purpose their sexual and labour exploitation. The legislation which is at an advanced stage of preparation will provide for compliance with two EU framework decisions &mdash; the framework decision combating trafficking in persons and the framework decision combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The legislation will also take account of several other international instruments such as the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the UN Convention against transnational organised crime, the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child <Col N="342"/>on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings, CAHTEH.</P>

        <P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my <Col N="344"/>proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that trafficking in human beings is a global problem. Within the EU indications are that trafficking in human beings takes place on a much smaller scale than illegal immigration. However, the nature of trafficking in human beings, including its clandestine nature and the vulnerability of victims, is such that it is harder to identify and, therefore, quantify. Consequently, it is essential that all governments are vigilant and take a proactive approach to preventing and combating the problem.</P>
        <P>A range of practical measures and policies are in place in this jurisdiction to combat trafficking in human beings. The Garda National Immigration Bureau which was established in 2000 has an investigation unit which investigates this type of crime. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes a proactive <Col N="345"/>approach and ensures that any allegations relating to trafficking in human beings are vigorously investigated. A number of specific Garda operations have been put in place to discover the extent to which Ireland has been targeted by persons suspected of being engaged in trafficking in persons, to prevent such activity and, where such activity is disclosed, to gather evidence to be used in any prosecution which may be initiated. Such operations, including Operation Quest, are ongoing. The latter operation was established under the direction of the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services to investigate allegations of trafficking of non-nationals into this country for the purpose of employment in the sex industry.</P>
        <P>Also, a working group on trafficking in human beings, chaired by my Department, is examining the extent and nature of trafficking into Ireland for the purposes of sexual exploitation and reviewing various measures in place to combat the phenomenon.</P>
        <P>A number of actions have been undertaken in recent years in the immigration field which contribute to the prevention of trafficking and to the protection of victims. The current immigration system in Ireland allows the authorities to deal with the victims of trafficking in a sympathetic and pragmatic way. It is recognised that it is in the interests of both the victims of trafficking and the authorities to co-operate with a view to ensuring the protection of victims and the prosecution of perpetrators. Although Ireland has not opted to participate in the EU Council directive dealing with the issue of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings, in practice a similar regime can be implemented under existing legislation. A number of voluntary return programmes are also in place to assist persons wishing to return to their country of origin.</P>
        <P>In the prevention of trafficking border controls are essential. The Garda National Immigration Bureau has a key role in this area. Work on border controls cannot be confined to Ireland alone. International co-operation between police and border control authorities is essential in combating trafficking. Co-operation with carriers, combined with carriers&rsquo; liability penalties, is also necessary to ensure that only people who are legitimately entitled to travel to Ireland are allowed to do so. Such co-operation assists in combating traffickers and smugglers seeking to facilitate illegal entry to Ireland.</P>
        <P>During the course of Garda investigations garda&iacute; liaise as necessary with Ruhama, an NGO which assists women who are the victims of violence, and persons reporting that they have been trafficked are always treated sympathetically by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Regarding legislative proposals, legislation is being prepared in my Department which will create a specific offence of trafficking human beings into, through or out of Ireland for the pur<Col N="346"/>pose their sexual and labour exploitation. The legislation which is at an advanced stage of preparation will provide for compliance with two EU framework decisions &mdash; the framework decision combating trafficking in persons and the framework decision combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The legislation will also take account of several other international instruments such as the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the UN convention against transnational organised crime, the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings. In the immigration area, I am also looking at how the forthcoming Immigration and Residence Bill can assist in dealing with this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The application referred to by the Deputy was refused by my Department in early 2005. When assessing applications of this type, the visa officer will consider, among other factors, whether the level of salary of the worker would come within the ambit of qualifying for payment from public funds. In this regard the criteria set by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for eligibility for family income supplement payment, FIS, have been used. The criteria, which may change from time to time, are available on that Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.welfare.ie/publications/sw22.html</i>.</P>
        <P>If the level of the worker&rsquo;s income as evidenced by his or her payslips or P60 would qualify for FIS payments, the application for a visa is generally refused. The visa officer will expect to see sufficient evidence of the financial status of the applicant, in the form of P60 for the most recent tax year, several payslips and detailed bank statements covering, at a minimum, a two to three month period. The documentation supplied should demonstrate a consistent financial history and evidence of regular income.</P>
        <P>In the case of visa-required family members of non EEA national workers, the general rule is that after the worker has been in the State for 12 months and has been offered employment for a further 12 months that they may be joined by their families. This is subject to the worker being able to support the family without recourse to public funds.</P>
        <P>The procedures for dealing with visa applications from family members of work permit hol<Col N="347"/>ders who wish to join that worker in the State are under consideration as part of ongoing developments within the Irish naturalisation and immigration service. It is open to the applicant to lodge a new application outlining his current situation and this application will be fully considered by my Department.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to Question No. 91 on Wednesday, 23 November 2005. The consideration given to such cases is the same as that given to other leave to remain applications. The decision not to deport a person who is illegally in the State, that is, grant temporary leave to remain, arises under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. Each case is individually considered in the context of its own particular circumstances, having regard to the 11 factors cited in the Act, and having regard to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>.</P>
        <P>There is no catch all policy &mdash; be it to deport, or allow to stay &mdash; in relation to unaccompanied minors who reach the age of 18 years. All cases are considered on their individual merits.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 459 and 469 together.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 27 October 2003 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Appli<Col N="350"/>cations Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The person concerned was informed by letter dated 10 August 2005 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit within 15 working days representations to the Minister in writing setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. His case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>.</P>
        <P>Consideration was given to representations received on his behalf from his legal representative for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 14 December 2005, I refused temporary leave to remain and instead signed a deportation order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 2 February 2006, in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned presented as required and was given a further presentation date. He is due to present again on 28 February 2006.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is awaiting deportation following a comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State. All representations made regarding his good character were considered pursuant to section 3(6)(<i>g</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. These were deemed not to constitute sufficient grounds for revoking the deportation order and granting leave to remain instead. The decision to deport, therefore, remains unchanged. The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

	<P>The vast majority of such crimes, including sexual offences, are committed by individuals with no diagnosed or treatable mental illness. In the small proportion of cases where a perpetrator has a previous history of mental illness or is diagnosed with a mental illness while serving a sentence, arrangements are <Col N="351"/>undertaken to provide appropriate psychiatric intervention.</P>
        <P>In relation to treatment programmes for sex offenders in prison, there are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention for sex offenders operating within the prison system.

	<P>When assessing any visa application, the visa officer will consider various matters, including whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicant would fully honour the conditions of the visa such as whether it is likely that the applicant would overstay the length of time applied for. The visa officer will also have regard to information provided and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in their country of origin. The application in question was refused because the visa officer could not reasonably be satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa.</P>
        <P>Additionally, it was felt there were insufficient finances available and the sponsor did not provide a detailed bank statement. The visa officer decided that there was no clear link with the reference and that in fact, they had never met. There were no details of return flights provided and the applicant intended to source language courses and apply for a study visa. Therefore, in all the circumstances, the visa officer was not satisfied that the conditions of a visa would be adhered to.</P>
        <P>It is open to the applicant to appeal the decision within two months of the notification of the refusal. The visa appeals officer will review the application taking into consideration any <Col N="355"/>additional documentation supplied in support of the appeal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983 provides for the performance of unpaid work in the community by a person who is 16 years or over, who has been convicted of an offence for which the appropriate penalty would be an immediate custodial sentence and who has given his or her consent to the court.</P>
        <P>It has not been the practice for individuals on community service orders to undertake work which is normally the responsibility of paid local authority employees such as litter collection. However, the probation and welfare service&rsquo;s management has advised that arrangements are in place with some local authorities which allow for such work to be undertaken by those on community service orders.</P>
        <P>Under the current legislation, community service can only be imposed on an individual if the alternative is a custodial sentence. In addition, the individual must consent to the order. The Deputy&rsquo;s proposals would require an amendment to the current legislation and I have no plans in the immediate future in this regard. While I have no plans to amend the legislation in the immediate future, the current legislation will, like all my Department&rsquo;s legislation, be kept under review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 471 and 507 together.</P>
        <P>The question of introducing a road safety and driver education syllabus into schools has been examined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on foot of a report from a task group set up in 2000 and which included representatives of the Department of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Safety Council, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, Rosary College, Crumlin, the Northern Ireland Council for the Curriculum, Examination and Assessment, CCEA, and the NCCA. The NCCA also commissioned a study of driver education in post-primary schools from Dr. Ray Fuller of Trinity College Dublin.</P>
        <P>The NCCA, the role of which is to advise the Minister for Education and Science on curriculum and assessment issues, recommended that road safety be addressed within the context of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and that driver education, specifically learning to drive for pupils aged 17, should not become part of the school curriculum. The NCCA noted that this concurred with the practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>At the start of the 2001-02 school year the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive &mdash; a road safety resource for transition year and the senior cycle &mdash; to all second level schools. This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users. A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack along with copies of Rules of the Road. In the preparation of the Staying Alive resources material, views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety. Prior to its issue to second level schools, the material was piloted in 20 schools and the response from teachers in those schools was very positive.</P>
        <P>A new high level Government road safety group, of which I am a member, has met and the role of education in addressing road safety will be discussed in this forum. My Department will be represented on the group.</P>

        <P>It is considered by my Department that all reasonable efforts have been made to facilitate the person concerned with a suitable transport service. The offer of a suitably adapted service remains available to the parents should they wish to avail of it.</P>

	<P>A key element of delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, the new action plan for educational inclusion, is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second-level schools for the purposes of qualifying for resources, both human and financial, according to the degree of disadvantaged experienced. This standardised system will replace all of the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage. The new action plan aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second level education, three to 18 years, from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. It will involve an additional annual investment of some &euro;40 million on full implementation and the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.</P>
        <P>The identification process involved a new survey by the Educational Research Centre of all mainstream primary schools and the updating of existing data sources on the levels of disadvantage in second-level schools. As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban and town, 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The identification process is nearing completion and we anticipate being in a position to issue an invitation to selected schools to participate in the new integrated school support programme shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 478 to 481, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy on class size is set out in the table below. The data refer to the 2004-05 school year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2004-05 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers including learning support and resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1 in 2004-05. As I indicated in my statement on the recently published Estimates, I have secured sufficient funding to provide for even smaller classes in our <Col N="362"/>primary schools in the next school year. The Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. This means that while schools are staffed at present on the basis of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils, over the next two years this will be reduced to 28 in 2006-07 and 27 in 2007-08.</P>
        <P>The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department Primary Circular 19/02, which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P><Col N="361"/>

Under current agreed arrangements, an allowance is paid to a recognised teacher who has been awarded a graduate or higher diploma in special educational needs. The rate of allowance is the same as the allowance paid to recognised teachers who completed the advanced diploma in special education from St. Patrick&rsquo;s College of Education.</P>

        <P>Five post-primary and four primary schools in County Westmeath and two post-primary and three primary schools in County Longford are currently designated as disadvantaged under the disadvantaged areas scheme. Under this scheme, schools are in receipt of such supports as additional supplementary capitation, 95% building grant for building projects, additional teach<Col N="364"/>ing assistance as well as participation in the home-school-community liaison scheme, etc.</P>
        <P>A key element of delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, the new action plan for educational inclusion is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools for the purposes of qualifying for resources, both human and financial, according to the degree of disadvantaged experienced. This standardised system will replace all of the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage. A new integrated school support programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters-communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the school support programme on a phased basis over the implementation period. The identification process is being finalised and we anticipate being in a position to issue an invitation to selected schools to participate in the new school support programme shortly.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young <Col N="366"/>people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>The service is developing on a continuing basis. The total authorised staffing complement of the board is 94 comprising 16 headquarters and support staff, five regional managers, 12 senior educational welfare officers and 61 EWOs. Towns that have an EWO allocated to them include Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo, Naas, Castlebar, Longford, Tuam, Tullamore, Letterkenny and Portlaoise. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Since September 2005 every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service. In addition to the NEWB staff, some 490 staff are in educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element.

	<P>The mainstream teacher allocation of all primary schools, including one-teacher schools, is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The staffing schedule is outlined in a circular which is issued annually to all primary schools. In addition, such schools may be eligible for additional teacher or special needs assistant allocations in accordance with the criteria for the allocation of special needs resource.</P>
        <P>Sections 14, 15 and 23 of the Education Act 1998 assigns each board of management and principal teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of schools at both primary and post-primary level. Principals should organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of pupils during school hours. In particular, they should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch breaks, assembly and dismissal. Rules 121(4) and 124(1) of the rules for national schools and section 23(2) of the Education Act 1998 oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are on school premises, during school time and/or on school activities. Accordingly, the responsibility of all teachers individually and collectively to provide a duty of care at all times towards the pupils in the <Col N="369"/>school in which they teach, including periods of supervision, remains. Special needs assistants who may be assigned to schools to cater for pupils with significant care needs may be required to assist such pupils, if appropriate.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. The statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The safety statement should be reviewed on a regular basis. A detailed review of the position of the 13 one-teacher schools with less than 12 pupils enrolled on the 30 September 2004 is being undertaken and will be completed as speedily as possible.</P>

	<P>The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning. The school in question was listed in my announcement of April 2005 as a project to progress through architectural planning up to pre-tender stage, that is, up to and including advanced architectural planning. To bring this project to the required stage, my Department&rsquo;s officials have requested and received various amendments to the stage 1 submission &mdash; site suitability, briefing and site report &mdash; during 2005. Most recently my Department&rsquo;s officials wrote to the school authorities with some further queries and a response has been received. This is being examined. When this analysis is complete my officials will be in further contact with the school authorities with regard to the next steps involved in progressing this project. Progression of projects to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-09.</P>

	<P>My Department is in receipt of the correspondence to which he refers and a reply is in the process of issuing. The school in question is operating with temporary recognition from my Department. At the time temporary recognition was granted, the patron body was notified in writing of the terms and conditions underpinning the grant of recognition. In this regard, it was specifically stated that the patron has sole responsibility for the critically important matter of accommodation. It was also made clear that the accommodation sourced by the patron would be required to meet the needs of the school as it developed and that in the event of permanent recognition being granted, interim accommodation would remain the patron&rsquo;s responsibility until the Department was in a position to provide permanent accommodation. In subsequent correspondence, the patron was also informed that the State-owned buildings in which it had expressed an interest had been earmarked for other educational purposes, specifically, for a school which has secured permanent recognition and, therefore, qualified to attract capital funding. This remains the position and the Department is completely satisfied there can be no misunderstanding on the patron&rsquo;s behalf in regard to this matter.</P>
        <P>With regard to schools of differing ethos sharing a site, the development of multi-school campus arrangements is a stated policy of my Department. Such arrangements will form an unequivocal feature of the educational landscape into the future to the extent that it will not be unusual to find a more significant range of school types on one site. It is intended, however, that while individual schools will be arranged in order that certain facilities can be shared to avoid duplication, schools will otherwise be structured to enable them to operate independently of one and other to protect their individual ethos. Under public procurement procedures for State buildings, all health and safety regulations will be fully complied with in the implementation such an accommodation solution and sites will only be developed to the limit of their potential.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers submitted an application for grant aid under the summer works scheme 2006, SWS, to upgrade the mechanical works in the school. However, as the <Col N="371"/>Deputy may be aware, plans to provide a brand new state of the art building for the school in question are currently in architectural planning. In such circumstances, it is my Department&rsquo;s policy not to invest significant capital funding in a building that will not remain in use, which is the case in this instance. Consequently, the SWS application was not approved. However, the school building section is prepared to examine a possible reduced scope of works to ensure the continued operation of the school pending the delivery of its new building. It will be in direct contact with the school when its proposal in this regard has been received.</P>

	<P>The objective of the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, is to provide full-time second chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults who are over the age of 21 and in receipt of specified social welfare payments for at least six months. Given that demand for places from eligible applicants exceeds supply, I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for VTOS. However, a number of other options are available to adults in further education and higher education. For example, the back to education initiative which was introduced in 2002 and is mainly administered by the vocational education committees, consists of courses similar to VTOS which are provided on a part-time basis. The intention of this initiative is to provide flexibility in the provision of the programme to meet the demand of adults wishing to return to education and training, including those who may not be eligible for VTOS. Post-leaving certificate programmes are also available to adults, as are full-time third level courses. For these two options, tuition fees are free and there are means-tested maintenance grants available.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, individual school authorities are responsible in the first instance for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care. Provision is built into the annual school building programme to enable <Col N="373"/>schools to address urgent health and safety issues as identified by the school authority by way of an annual allocation, currently amounting to &euro;3,809 plus &euro;12.70 per pupil, under the devolved grants scheme for minor works.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>The service is developing on a continuing basis. The total authorised staffing complement of the board is 94, comprising 16 HQ and support staff, five regional managers, 12 senior educational welfare officers and 61 educational welfare officers. Towns which have an educational welfare officer allocated to them include Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo, Naas, Castlebar, Longford, Tuam, Tullamore, Letterkenny and Portlaoise. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Since September 2005, every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service.</P>
        <P>In addition to the NEWB staff, there are some 490 staff in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently, work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for integrated working between the different services involved.</P>
        <P>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s question relating to the number of absentees reported to the NEWB for the 2004-05 school year in the constituency of Dublin south east, my Department has requested the National Educational Welfare Board to respond directly to the Deputy on the matter, providing a breakdown if available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that in general it is parental choice that determines whether a child who is deaf goes to a special school or to a mainstream school with support. My Department supports the child whatever option is taken up by the parent. The policy is to have a range of provision available. Issues such as the following assist the parent in making an informed choice: the age and maturity of the child; the extent of the child&rsquo;s hearing impairment-deafness; the presence of any other disability &mdash; for example, general learning disability, autism, physical disability, etc.; the distance between the child&rsquo;s home and the nearest appropriate special school, whether the child would be a residential pupil or a day attender; their awareness of the programmes being delivered in the special school; their evaluation of how important it is for the child to have a continuous schooling from 4-5 years of age to 18 years of age; proximity to an appropriate special class in a mainstream school; their knowledge of the mainstream school; their perception of its experience with pupils with special needs; the availability of resource teaching for the child; the availability of the visiting teacher service; their knowledge of the child&rsquo;s chances for appropriate education at second level, on transfer from primary; and the significance they attach to having their child at home.</P>
        <P>All of these are factors that influence parental choice. Generally, those around the child in the early years &mdash; audiologists, psychologists, visiting teachers, etc., will give the parent an idea of the pupil&rsquo;s level of need and the options available. They assist the parent in making choices, but the parent makes the final decision.</P>
        <P>I would also like to assure the Deputy that I will take the advice of the National Council for Special Education, which has a research function and part of whose remit it is to advise my Department on policy matters and other issues relating to the education of deaf and hard of hearing pupils nationwide, including the Dublin area.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme which is administered by the local authorities on behalf of my Department, the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</P>
        <P>The candidate&rsquo;s reckonable income for the purposes of the means test is his-her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his-her parents or guardians, where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being exempt. Grant assistance may not be awarded in any case where the reckonable income exceeds the prescribed income limits for the award of a grant.</P>
        <P>It is understood from the awarding authority that the candidate referred to by the Deputy was not eligible for the maintenance grant as the <Col N="378"/>reckonable income in this case exceeded the prescribed limit as set out in the higher education grant scheme. I regret that it is not possible to allow grant aid where reckonable income exceeds the prescribed limits irrespective of the particular circumstances.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the ESF-aided student assistance fund for third level institutions. The objective of this fund is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, because of financial reasons, suffer severe hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies. Application for funding should be made by the student to the access officer in their institution. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for maintenance grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in <Col N="379"/>exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s four student maintenance grant schemes, grants are payable to candidates pursuing approved full-time courses who meet prescribed conditions, including those pertaining to nationality, residency, means, age and previous academic attainment. Under the residency requirement a candidate&rsquo;s parents, or in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate herself/himself, must have been resident in the State from 1 October of the year prior to entry on an approved course.</P>
        <P>I regret that in cases such as the one referred to by the Deputy, where an independent mature candidate is not ordinarily resident in the State from the specified date, 1 October 2003 in this instance, she is ineligible for financial assistance. It is not open to me, or to my Department, to depart from the terms of the schemes in individual cases.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 514 and 522 together.</P>
        <P>The cost of providing home tuition for children with autism who are attending school is estimated at &euro;1 million euro annually. As the Deputy may be aware, the home tuition scheme is primarily intended to provide compensatory instruction for pupils who have a medical ailment that is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school. In this context, my Department provides home tuition grants in respect of pupils who cannot attend school at all, or who are absent for a significant proportion of the school year. My Department also sanctions home tuition in cases where children are awaiting a suitable school placement. My Department considers that school-based education provision is the most appropriate intervention for all children and has discontinued the practice whereby children who are in full-time education provision would also be able to avail of home tuition grants.</P><Col N="380"/>
        <P>The number of children with autism who are in a full-time education placement and who are in receipt of a home tuition grant is approximately 100. My Department has written to these pupils&rsquo; parents confirming its intention to discontinue the practice of sanctioning home tuition grants for pupils who are in full-time education. This has also been communicated to the pupil&rsquo;s school. These cases have also been referred to the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, with a view to ensuring that an appropriate educational response can be provided by the school. In the interim, however, my Department has sanctioned the continuance of the home tuition grant until 10 February to allow further consideration to be given to the pupil&rsquo;s needs.</P>

	<P>Further to Parliamentary Question No. 532 of 31 January 2006, information is provided in the appendix in regard to the inspection of Irish in 152 post-primary schools during the calendar years 2004 and 2005. This updated figure takes account of a number of inspections of Irish, in the period 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2004, which had not previously been included. Apart from the 75 schools listed where the focus of the inspection was on the teaching and learning of Irish at junior certificate level, the inspections covered the teaching and learning of Irish across all years.</P>
        <P>A totally revised format of subject inspection was introduced from September 2001. Since then the policy has been to inspect Irish in different schools each year as part of the planned programme of inspection. Therefore, none of the 152 schools where the teaching and learning of Irish was evaluated in the calendar years 2004 and 2005 had been inspected under the new format for subject inspection introduced a few years previously.</P>
        <P>In accordance with my recent announcement in relation to the publication of inspection reports on schools, reports on the teaching and learning of Irish in post-primary schools will only be published for those inspections conducted on or after 6 February 2006. Irish has been the second most frequently inspected subject in the period September 2001 to the end of 2004. One of the <Col N="381"/>three core subjects Irish, English or mathematics is always inspected within a whole school evaluation, WSE, and, in line with this policy, Irish has been evaluated in 30 of the 65 WSEs carried out during 2004 and 2005. </P>

	<P Just="Left">I signed the Education Act 1998 (Publication of Inspection Reports on Schools and Centres for Education) Regulations 2006 and placed these regulations before the Oireachtas last week. The document entitled Publication of School Inspection Reports: Guidelines, 30 January 2006, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie.</i> The guidelines state that publication procedures will apply to all inspections commenced on or after 6 February 2006.</P>
        <P>This includes all subject inspection reports on Irish at post-primary level. The regulations do not allow for publication of reports of any inspections conducted prior to 6 February 2006. The inspection reports when finalised will be placed on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

        <Quest>the reason for the delay in refunding spouses and children&rsquo;s contributions to single teachers who retired on 31 August 2005; and when said refund will be made to a person (details supplied) in County Dublin who retired on that date.</Quest>

	<P>Under the spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s scheme introduced for male teachers in 1969, and extended to female teachers in 1981, a refund of contributions is made to a teacher who is single at the time of retirement. A full refund is made where the teacher has never been married; a partial refund is made where the teacher&rsquo;s spouse is already deceased.

	<P>I am aware of the decreasing numbers of males entering the teaching profession, and it is an issue that is of concern to me. I believe that it is important to attract more men into teaching for a number of reasons, not least of which is the positive role models that teachers provide in children&rsquo;s lives and the desirability of having both male and female role models in our schools.</P>
        <P>I believe that teaching should be seen as an attractive profession for both men and women. Teaching is fulfilling work which makes a huge social contribution.</P>
        <P>This Government wants to attract and reward the best teachers. In addition to increasing teachers&rsquo; salaries, we have also undertaken other initiatives to enhance the status of the profession. Not least of these is the establishment of the Teaching Council as a professional regulatory body.</P>
        <P>I have recently launched the report of the primary education committee, Males into Primary Teaching. The primary education committee was established in order to examine a range of issues in regard to males entering primary teaching, and to make recommendations on short-term and long-term strategies to increase the numbers in this regard.</P>
        <P>The report draws on the professional insight of key experts in this area as well as drawing on a number of relevant research studies. The report&rsquo;s findings will be of significant benefit in assisting <Col N="391"/>the development of future policy in this important area.</P>
        <P>One of the key recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s report is that a co-ordinated promotion campaign, which would encourage boys as well as girls to enter primary teaching, should be undertaken. This promotion campaign commenced on 24 January, and is currently ongoing.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have already stated that the senior cycle Irish curriculum will be reviewed as a matter of priority, with a view to putting more emphasis on oral Irish and to making learning the language more enjoyable for all students, male and female, at both ordinary and higher level.</P>

	<P>My Department accepts the view that there is a spectrum of autistic conditions as supported by the two main classification systems that are used by mental health professionals, namely, The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, 1994, ICD-10, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, American Psychiatric Association, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, 2000, DSM-IV-TR. It is my intention to ensure that all children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, ASDs, receive education appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>All children with special education needs within the primary school system, including children with ASD, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The special educational needs of children with ASD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
        <P>Many children at primary school level, with disorders on the autistic spectrum, are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of resource teacher and-or special needs assistant services. Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and special <Col N="392"/>needs assistant support is provided where required.</P>
        <P>My Department allocates additional resources to individual second level schools to cater for special needs pupils enrolled in those schools.</P>

	<P>Personnel enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994 are not eligible for consideration for extension of service on completion of their initial five year term of enlistment unless they have a medical classification code not lower than YY, year of birth, -12-322. In the case in question the individual&rsquo;s medical classification code was assessed in the context of his application for extension of service as being, 80-33-111, which is below the required standard for extension of service. The application has been the subject of lengthy consideration and the individual has been afforded extensive opportunities to make representations to the military authorities in respect of his case, including a further medical assessment on 24 August, 2004 and consideration by a medical board on 5 July, 2005 convened at the direction of the general officer commanding 1 Southern Brigade. All medical assessments found him to be below the required medical classification for extension of service.</P>
        <P>The matter was referred to the deputy chief of staff, support, for consideration on 12 September, 2005 who having considered the matter directed that the individual&rsquo;s discharge should proceed as he did not meet the required criteria for extension of service. The individual was informed on 18 October, 2005 that his application for exten<Col N="393"/>sion of service had not been approved and he was given seven days within which to submit representations in regard to his proposed discharge. The application for discharge together with representations from the person in question, were submitted to the general officer commanding 1 Southern Brigade on 14 November 2005. The general officer commanding having considered these representations was unable to recommend extension of service as the person in question did not meet the medical criteria for extension of service.</P>
        <P>The case was again submitted to the deputy chief of staff, support, who considered it further and directed that discharge should now proceed. The date of discharge has been set at 9 March, 2006 having regard to all outstanding leave entitlements in the case. All personnel are required to meet the required medical criteria for extension of service, which are of general application and exceptions cannot be made in individual cases.</P>

	<P>In accordance with established public service pensions policy, the pensions of former members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, are revised in line with relevant increases in the pay of serving personnel holding corresponding rank. The benefit of the various general and benchmarking pay increases awarded to serving NCOs and privates under the Sustaining Progress social partnership agreement 2003 to 2005 has been extended to the pensions of their retired counterparts, up to and including the 2% general round increase effective from 1 December 2004.</P>
        <P>Under the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, a new pay agreement was announced for the public service in June 2004, subject to the usual verification procedures. This provides for payment of the final instalment of benchmarking effective from 1 June 2005, equivalent to one quarter of the recommended pay awards, together with phased general pay increases of 1.5% from 1 June 2005, 1.5% from 1 December 2005 and 2.5% from 1 June 2006. Application of these pay increases to serving NCOs and privates of the PDF is subject to, among other things, acceptance by their representative association, PDFORRA, of the pay and related terms arising <Col N="394"/>from the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, which they have been offered within the established negotiation machinery. In that regard, I understand that the PDFORRA membership is currently balloting on the offer. Acceptance of the new pay agreement would pave the way for corresponding increases in the pensions of retired NCOs and privates.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 537 to 540, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Under the Building Control Act 1990, compliance with the building regulations, including Part M, access for people with disabilities, is primarily the responsibility of the builders and owners of buildings.</P>
        <P>Local building control authorities are responsible for enforcing the building regulations. Local authorities are empowered to inspect buildings within their functional area, to issue enforcement notices for non-compliance and to initiate court proceedings. The national target is that each authority should inspect at least 12% to 15% of buildings for which valid commencement notices are served on the authority.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>The statistic regarding compliance of new Dublin houses with Part M may arise from a review of the effectiveness of Part M published by the National Disability Authority, NDA, in December 2005. The survey of medium density housing developments in Dublin contained in this NDA report states that some one third of the units surveyed, for example, duplexes, are not <Col N="405"/>required to be wheelchair accessible in order to comply with Part M. A further 23% were found to be compliant with Part M, but issues in regard to dishing of kerbs in the public footpaths approaching the dwellings were identified. These would be for resolution between local authority and the developer, prior to takeover of the developments.</P>
        <P>I am anxious that the overall level of compliance should improve as designers and builders gain greater experience of working to Part M standards for new dwellings, which in many cases only apply, in practice, from 1 January 2004. I initiated a review of Part M, and the related technical guidance document M, in late 2005 through the publication of a public consultation notice inviting submissions by 31 March 2006 on how the Part M regime might be further improved.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Bill 2005, which I published on 22 December 2005, provides for the introduction of a disability access certificate, DAC, system, as recommended by the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. Under this system, the design of new non-domestic buildings and new apartment blocks will have to be certified by the local authority as being compliant with Part M, before work commences.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Bill 2005 also provides for the strengthening of the enforcement powers of the local building control authority. Under the Bill, the occupation, opening or operation of a relevant new building without a DAC will be an offence; and the authority will be able to apply for a High Court injunction to stop any such offence.</P>

	<P>Total receipts to date for the plastic bag levy on disposable shopping bags amount to &euro;51,020,976.</P>
        <P>Prior to the introduction of this levy, an estimated 1.2 billion plastic bags were given away free by retailers. The levy has led to a dramatic reduction in use of plastic bags with a consequent positive environmental benefit. Plastic shopping bags accounted for 5% of litter arising prior to the introduction of the levy, but for just 0.22% of litter arising in 2004.</P>

        <P>Already, residents of more than one year&rsquo;s duration of houses provided under the scheme who wish to become owner-occupiers may, on surrendering their house to the approved body, qualify for the following benefits: special mortgage allowance of &euro;11,450 over five years for mortgages created on or after 1 January 2002 to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership scheme; improvement works in lieu scheme in respect of the dwelling they are acquiring; low cost housing sites schemes; and exemption from the income limit for local authority housing loans.

	<P>I assume that the question refers to assistance from my Department under the voluntary housing schemes.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The administration of the schemes, and the certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the schemes, are the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
        <P>Approved housing bodies in liaison with local authorities have responsibility for the proper management of their dwellings, the operation of letting policies, fixing of rents, adequate repairs and maintenance systems to ensure the preservation of the dwellings and compliance with all relevant statutory regulations.</P>
        <P>There is no requirement on housing associations to provide accounts specifically to tenants, however, as a company limited by guarantee, they are required to make annual returns to the Companies Registration Office and these returns are available to the general public on request. In addition, housing authorities have the right to inspect the financial accounts on projects funded under the voluntary schemes.</P>

	<P>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000 the process for the appointment of members to An Bord Plean&aacute;la requires selections to be made from names put forward by six panels of nominating bodies prescribed for this purpose. As part of new planning regulations currently being prepared in my Department, I am considering the addition of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association as a nominating body to these panels.</P>
        <P>I should point out that appointees to An Bord Plean&aacute;la would not represent their nominating body, but be appointed to make independent assessments of planning authorities&rsquo; decisions submitted to the board on appeal. I intend to make the new regulations shortly.</P>

	<P>My Department is aware that sanitary authorities may in particular circumstances meter domestic water usage in order to assist water management and conservation measures. However, Government policy prohibits the charging of domestic households for domestic water meter services.</P>
        <P>In the case of domestic water supply provided by way of a private group water scheme, the installation of meters on individual connections is a matter for the group scheme management to decide. Groups are eligible for an annual subsidy from my Department of up to &euro;196.81 per house towards the operational cost of providing domestic water supplies to members. Where meters are installed by a group scheme as an integral part of a network upgrading and water conservation programme, grants of up to 85% of costs are payable, subject to a maximum grant of &euro;300 per meter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In accordance with the EU water framework directive, the national water services pricing policy framework provides for the recovery by sanitary authorities of the full cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes. This policy of cost recovery from the non-domestic sector extends to the provision of meters. The latter are necessary to ensure water charging of users according to actual consumption; this is planned to be commenced in all areas by December 2006.</P>
        <P>Where it is not possible to measure a supply to a farm or business at a single point, and an additional meter or meters must be installed, the costs of such additional meters are, in accordance <Col N="411"/>with the above arrangements, recovered from customers who require them.</P>
