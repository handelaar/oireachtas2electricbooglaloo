	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I offer c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte &mdash; a most sincere welcome &mdash; to Madame Ninh, vice-chair of the foreign affairs committee of the National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and her delegation.

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need to end the long-running controversy over the Niemba massacre of Irish soldiers in the Congo on 8 November, 1960, where nine men lost their lives, and support Private Thomas Kenny and Private Joseph Fitzpatrick, survivors of the massacre, on this matter; and for the House to pay tribute to all Irish United Nations soldiers who lost their lives while serving for international peace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the immediate need to provide Doolin coast guard search and rescue service with a new station at Doolin following the three recent drownings in County Clare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the small window of opportunity available for amendments to the electoral register which, coupled with a high level of inaccuracy on the register despite the recent advertising campaign, poses a threat to the integrity of the results of the next general election.  Despite the fact that the draft register is only now available in most local authorities, giving less than two weeks for corrections, why has the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government refused consistently to extend the deadline <Col N="1370"/>beyond 25 November thus disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of voters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the imminent diversion of 6,000 vehicles to the M50 when the port tunnel opens in December leading to predictable chaos on the M50 and surrounding outer feeder roads, which requires an emergency response involving the immediate lifting of the toll barriers.  If the Government is unwilling to do this, it can at least pay the tolls for commuters until the barriers go in 2008, the annual estimate for which is dwarfed by the stamp duty paid in areas serviced by the toll bridge.  It is time to give something back to those crippled by sky-rocketing house prices and epic commutes.  The Government must pay the tolls and lift the barriers now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the abdication by the Government of its care of older people with high dependency needs as manifested by its lack of confidence in some private nursing homes, and the need for the State to take over and fully fund all high dependency care for older people in accordance with their legal entitlement, whether such persons are located in State institutions or private nursing homes, and to encourage not-for-profit community alternatives for older-person care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the chronic traffic congestion in Clondalkin, Lucan and other towns surrounded by the N7, M50 and N4, which is impacting on the daily lives of tens of thousands of people, interfering with national economic activity and costing the State money through lost productivity; and the need for the Government to inject a new sense of urgency into tackling the gridlock by providing additional buses, the early electrification of the Kildare route as far as Adamstown by 2011 not 2015, and the early construction of the interconnector between Heuston Station and Spencer Dock.  If these actions are not taken, the gridlock will continue for another generation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the revelation that admissions have been suspended by the HSE for five nursing homes in the Dublin area, the fact that so few inspection reports are available on the Internet and the need for the Minister for Health and Children to make an immediate statement on what she knew about the state of our nursing homes, how she intends to tackle the serious problems in them and when she intends to introduce a robust and fully independent inspection system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need, in the absence of any substantial commitment to reduce greenhouse gas by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at the UN climate change summit in Nairobi, for the Government to commit itself to clear and binding annual targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on imported energy.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to approve immediately the Clonmel wilderness-Carrigeen regeneration scheme to improve physical infrastructural and tackle environmental issues in the area; and to ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste viewed with disbelief the information provided by Opposition Members on the closing down of nursing homes.  It seems the Government is terrified of the truth of these matters emerging.  I understand the HSE announced this morning that no patients should be accepted by four further nursing homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Deputy Kenny have a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When these are added to the expos&eacute; by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd last night of a further case, which made a mockery of the Minister&rsquo;s statement yesterday, it appears this matter is very serious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the matter.  As the Deputy knows, it was discussed for three hours over the last two nights and was the subject of Leaders&rsquo; Questions on Tuesday and Wednesday.  There is no provision for Leader&rsquo;s Questions on Thursday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a sad day when the Opposition as distinct from the Government has to deal with this.  When will the legislation governing the inde<Col N="1372"/>pendent nursing homes inspections be introduced?</P>
        <P>Over the past few weekends Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell and Senator Minihan have been far more active than the T&aacute;naiste in respect of his tax policy on stamp duty.  Does the T&aacute;naiste still believe the Government does not require &euro;2.5 billion in stamp duty revenue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We will give the Government a shopping list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest Deputy Kenny submits a question to the line Minister.  There is no provision for Leaders&rsquo; Questions on Thursday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has spoken publicly on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste proposing to include this in the Finance Bill next year?  When will the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Bill be published?  It was promised in 2004 and is on the list of promised legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the health Bill, the Taoiseach has indicated three times over the past few days that it is being drafted.  It was the subject of extensive consultation, the heads of the Bill were published last March and it will be dealt with when the D&aacute;il resumes in the new year.  The extensive consultation process elicited a large number of public submissions on the draft heads of the Bill.  While I appreciate that the Deputies opposite have other things to do, no input was received from any political party in the course of the valuable public consultation.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has opinions on everything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is now taking on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s practice of blaming the Opposition.  We are Members of this House and legislators.  The Government embarked on a lengthy consultation process.  As a result there is no legislation in place to protect the elderly from institutional abuse.  That is the legacy of the Govern<Col N="1373"/>ment for which the T&aacute;naiste must take responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Whose fault is that?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Chair has ruled.  We cannot have an omnibus question time, nor can we have Second Stage speeches.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not out of order.  I have two questions on promised legislation and I intend to ask them.  We were promised the health Bill in 2006 to protect elderly people from institutional abuse.  Will that legislation not appear until 2007?  In the meantime, can we not have a short emergency Bill to at least give the authority that is in place, HIQA, some power to protect elderly residents of nursing homes?  The T&aacute;naiste might remember that the House was recalled to pass emergency legislation to bail out Mr. Larry Goodman.  Are we not in a position to protect our elderly by introducing emergency legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Cabinet have the courage to deal with patient safety in respect of fertility clinics?  The High Court decision has opened a door that enables the Government to introduce promised legislation to regulate assisted human reproduction, <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation.  There are no regulations, protections or safeguards at present, which is a most serious lacuna in our legislation.  Will the T&aacute;naiste assure us that promised legislation will be fast-tracked so that the Bill will be published in early 2007?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation I mentioned will be published this session and debated as soon as the D&aacute;il resumes after Christmas.  It is not a good idea to put aside this Bill and pass emergency legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health and Children has instructed her officials to commence drafting the legislation to deal with this matter.  A commission examined the matter, as did an Oireachtas committee, a sub-committee of which produced a draft report.  Legislation will be put in place.  It is not a question of political cowardice, this is a delicate issue in which there are a variety of interests.  Many people will be dissatisfied with the outcome of whatever legislation is put in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>This is about patient safety.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

	<P>Given the horrific problems in our nursing homes, does the T&aacute;naiste intend to reconsider legislation in respect of tax relief for the owners of nursing homes?  It is the Government&rsquo;s profit before people philosophy that is the root cause of this.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised?  We cannot have a debate on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>People are cutting corners in nursing homes to make money at the expense of the most vulnerable people in Irish society.  The philosophy of the Government has led to this problem.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is aware that traffic conditions around the city are deteriorating at present.  The metro Bill was promised last year for publication this year.  Although it was to streamline procedures and reduce costs, it appears to have disappeared from the agenda.  Is it to be published or will it ever be dealt with?  It was to be published this year, but 2006 is now drawing to a close.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Although Ruhama and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department have highlighted the incidence of trafficking of human beings across Europe and from other quarters, there is no legislation on the Statute Book here.  Moreover, the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, agreed by the Council of Europe two years ago, has not been signed off by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department.  Is Ireland likely to sign that convention?  Is the T&aacute;naiste likely to induce the Government to sign it?  This has been waiting for signature for two years.  Is the T&aacute;naiste likely to introduce legislation that would deal with and combat trafficking in human beings?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

    <Title>Europol (Amendment) Bill 2006 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Second Stage. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The objective of this Bill is to give effect in our domestic law to three protocols to the Europol Convention.  The protocols, dated 2000, 2002 and 2003, relate to the competence of Europol in the area of money-laundering, as well as clarification of certain matters concerning joint investigation teams, and the streamlining of certain matters relating to the internal working of Europol.  This Bill will enable the protocols to have the force of law in the State and will amend, for that purpose, the Europol Act 1997.  The three protocols will then become Schedules to the 1997 Act.</P>
        <P>Before discussing the protocols in more detail, I will discuss Europol and its development since the Europol Convention came into force in this jurisdiction in 1998.  In tackling organised crime, access to intelligence and information is essential, both in the domestic and the international arena, and is of crucial importance when tackling serious crime, including terrorist offences, which usually involve networks of people in several countries who are very well resourced, both financially and as regards technical know-how.  In this situation, co-operation between police administrations across national borders is needed to tackle crimes of this nature in an effective way.  The Europol Act 1997 gave the force of law to the convention on the establishment of a European Police Office, or Europol Convention.  Europol was established to operate as a support service to police services in all member states with the primary task of facilitating the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities, as well as carrying out detailed analyses in respect of the crimes within its remit.  In general terms, the Europol Convention provides for member states to forward information to Europol concerning persons who are suspected of having committed or taken part in criminal offences in respect of which Europol is competent or who have been convicted of such offences.  The primary purpose of Europol is to facilitate the exchange of information and intelligence, as well as certain analytical work, in order to assist the member states in preventing and combating serious international organised crime.</P>
        <P>Europol does not have any executive power.  It is simply a support service for police and other law enforcement agencies in its member states.  Europol generally acts on request from police services in the member states.  There are preconditions to be established before Europol can become active in a case.  The investigation must involve two or more member states, there must be an organised criminal network implicated and, of course, the matter must be within Europol&rsquo;s remit.</P><Col N="1383"/>
        <P>While Europol does not have any operational powers, its purpose is to support national law enforcement authorities and to facilitate EU police co-operation.  Ireland has liaison officers posted to Europol to assist in the exchange of information and analysis work and under the convention, each member state is required to establish a national unit to act as a centralised contact point for all communications with Europol.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides practical support to Europol through the exchange of intelligence and participation in analytical work for purposes of contributing to the objectives of Europol.  I pay tribute to the garda&iacute; for their work in this regard.</P>
        <P>I will briefly discuss the recent Irish experience of Europol.  In Ireland, I am informed that the subject of the requests dealt with by the Garda Liaison Bureau tends to be transactions linked to serious crime such as fraud.  This is in contrast to the situation a number of years ago where the predominant area of activity was in transactions related to drugs.  Nevertheless, the fight against drug-related crime is still a significant part of the interaction between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Europol.  One example was the case of an international gang of drug smugglers which was intercepted with a substantial cache of ecstasy tablets, resulting in a number of significant arrests, following intelligence received via the Europol network.</P>
        <P>The effectiveness of Europol is, of course, dependent on the nature and extent of the information which it obtains.  In this regard, it is very important that adequate safeguards are in place to guarantee the confidentiality, security and accuracy of the information exchanged and shared.  The Europol Convention provides for particular safeguards for this purpose.  It acknowledges that particular attention must be paid to the privacy rights of individuals and the protection of personal information, requiring each member state to provide for the application of data protection law in regard to information processed through the Europol system.  In this connection, the Bill contains an amendment to the Europol Act 1997, providing that the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 apply in respect of the processing of information relating to individuals which is processed automatically at Europol.  The Data Protection Commissioner is designated under the Europol Act 1997 as the supervisory body in the State for purposes of that Act and of the Europol Convention.  The functions of the Data Commissioner, pursuant to Article 23 of the convention, include independent monitoring and supervision of the activities of the national unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was established under section 3 of the Europol Act 1997, in so far as these activities are of relevance and relate to the protection of personal data.</P>
        <P>Turning to the detail, the Bill, when enacted, will enable Ireland to ratify three additional protocols to the Europol Convention.  The Office of <Col N="1384"/>the Attorney General has advised that these protocols should be given effect by way of amendment to the Europol Act 1997 in primary legislation.  Enactment will allow Ireland to continue to fulfil its international obligations.  Their effect will be to extend the mandate of Europol to clarify certain powers and streamline its work.  However, I emphasise that the passing of this Bill will not alter in any substantive way the structure of Europol.</P>
        <P>The Bill under consideration is divided into five sections.  Section 1 amends section 1(1) of the Europol Act 1997 by adding definitions for the 2000, 2002 and 2003 protocols.  Section 2 amends section 2 of the Europol Act 1997 to give the force of law in this State to these three additional protocols and to provide for judicial notice to be taken of them.  The first of the three protocols, that of 30 November 2000, extends the competence of Europol to money laundering, regardless of the type of offences from which the laundered proceeds originate.  The detection and control of money laundering is a key element in the fight against terrorism and organised crime and it is essential that Europol is armed with the powers necessary to ensure it operates effectively in this sphere.  The issue of illegal money laundering has rightly acquired a more central role in Europol&rsquo;s work.  We are all aware that developments in modern technology mean that vast sums of money can be transferred in a matter of seconds through several countries by electronic transfer through an intricate series of financial transactions.</P>
        <P>The second protocol, dated 28 November 2003, clarifies certain powers in respect of the participation in joint investigation teams and the privileges and immunity applying to members of Europol.  It is important that maximum benefit is derived from co-operation between member states when investigating cross-border crime.  Provision for officials of Europol to participate in a support capacity in joint investigation teams is provided for in Article 1 of the Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on Joint Investigation Teams and under Article 13 of the convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between Member States of the European Union.  The protocol in question clarifies liability and privilege in respect of Europol&rsquo;s participation in such teams.  The third protocol under consideration, dated 27 November 2003, streamlines the internal working of Europol, particularly in respect of liaison procedures and analysis and the processing of data.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier, section 3 of the Bill amends section 6(1) of the Europol Act 1997 by providing that the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 apply for the purposes of the Europol Act 1997, the Europol Convention and the five protocols to the convention in respect of the retention, use or disclosure of certain information relating to individuals that is processed automatically at Europol.  This section was introduced at the <Col N="1385"/>suggestion of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to clarify that the Data Protection Acts apply for the purposes of the protocols, as well as the convention itself.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides for the addition of the three protocols in both the English and Irish languages as Schedules to the Europol Act 1997, while section 5 contains the short title of the Bill.  The protocols in question will, on the passing of this Bill into law, become Schedules to the Europol Act 1997 and will allow Ireland, subject to Government approval, to ratify them.</P>
        <P>The Europol Convention provides a framework for law enforcement co-operation in the field of international organised crime.  It provided for the establishment of Europol in October 1998, following ratification of the convention by all member states, including Ireland.</P>
        <P>A number of other bodies operating in the area of law enforcement and security, such as Eurojust, CEPOL and FRONTEX, have been established.  In the context of the changing environment, the Austrian Presidency of the Council launched a political debate on the framework and objectives of the further development of Europol at the informal meeting of ministers, which was held in Vienna in January 2006.  On that occasion, ministers were invited to discuss how Europol could be developed further so that the law enforcement authorities of member states could derive maximum benefit from any such development.  At that meeting, ministers gave a clear commitment to strengthen Europol and to make it more effective.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Currently we hear about increasing crime rates in this country.  There have been significant increases in crime over the last number of years.  Enormous increases of the order of almost 40% have occurred in headline crime since 2000.  International crime is also escalating.  It makes sense that we strengthen our international co-operation measures and the need to do that has never been as urgent.  Not so long ago, in a single day &euro;6 million worth of heroin was seized in Dublin, which is testament to the fact that the international drug lords and other dangerous criminals are at this stage using Ireland as a extension of their multinational criminal empires.  Never before has Ireland been so vulnerable to undesirable criminal elements.  These criminal overlords seek to use the freedom of movement throughout the Union, which I support for lawful activity, for the movement of goods and people to their advantage in distributing illegal substances, trafficking human beings and selling firearms, which are too often used by the gangs here with impunity.  </P>
        <P>It is important to realise how serious the problem has become.  I mentioned lately in response to a newspaper article about the latest weekend murder that such murders, varying in number from week to week, were becoming a regular part <Col N="1386"/>of our weekend news diet.  I checked the figures and note that during the past four years, which is roughly the period since the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been in office, 188 people were murdered or killed violently here, and the numbers are increasing rather than decreasing.  The figure this year is exceptionally alarming.  Many of these people owe their debts to international criminals who supply unscrupulous Irish murderers with dangerous and illegal weapons.</P>
        <P>In that context, I supported the idea of an arms amnesty and I am disappointed so few of those dangerous and illegal weapons were handed up.  Perhaps an issue for further discussion or separate debate at a future date should be how an effective amnesty could be introduced that would reach the criminal elements and result in the handing up of the tens of thousands of illegal weapons that appear to be in the country.  That does not arise in the context of this debate.  However, I share the same objective as the Minister in this respect and I am sad it was not realised.</P>
        <P>Returning to the Bill, Europol is the European law enforcement organisation that handles criminal intelligence.  Its mission is to assist the law enforcement authorities and member states in their fight against serious forms of organised crime.  Unfortunately, there are no boundaries for organised criminal groups, as with the availability of modern technology and enormous resources these groups are illegally active worldwide.  Organised crime represents a threat to the structure and values of our democratic systems and that affects all European citizens.  It affects the security and freedom of all not only our citizens but citizens elsewhere in the Union.</P>
        <P>Europol is a small organisation.  It operates on what is effectively a tiny budget of &euro;65 million.  It has a staff of slightly more than 500.  Given that the European Union has a population of approximately 300,000 million, Europol appears to be a small organisation with a tiny budget and an enormous mandate.  I would have liked Ireland to have taken a frontline role in the past in trying to extend Europol&rsquo;s mandate and give it a more effective and broad-ranging role.  From that point of view, I am encouraged by the confirmation from the Minister that the current Austrian Presidency has launched a political debate on the framework and objectives of the future development of Europol.  I would encourage that debate and encourage the Minister, while he has a mandate, to contribute actively to the development of that idea and to offer ideas and support in any way possible towards the strengthening of Europol, in particular exploring how it can be made effective.</P>
        <P>I did not note from Europol&rsquo;s personnel figures any great indication of an Irish involvement.  The Minister when replying might outline, from an administrative point of view, the Irish personnel involved, the level they operate at, whether they <Col N="1387"/>are Europol liaison or security officers or in what capacity they are involved.  He might also indicate Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to Europol&rsquo;s budget of &euro;65 million.</P>
        <P>In regard to this Bill, any legislation that helps to tackle the problem of organised international crime has my support.  My main concern is not to in any way hamper or hinder the activities of Europol but to explore whether it is sufficiently developed as an organisation to provide a sufficient input into the fight against international crime.</P>
        <P>This legislation specifically strengthens the international dimension of our policing system, which is to be welcomed.  In particular, it gives the force of law to three protocols concerned with international policing co-operation and co-ordination.  It is important to use this occasion to seriously reflect on the fact that Europol has been in place for 15 years since the ratification of the Maastricht treaty.  It has made a contribution in helping the European police forces to combat terrorism, tackle unlawful drug trafficking and confront serious forms of international organised crime.  There has probably been insufficient debate as to how effective it has been.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My concern is not to criticise Europol or the contribution we make or do not make to it but to establish whether it can be developed and made more effective in the future.  The Maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 and at this stage Europol is co-ordinating the role of police forces ranging from the force in Seville in Spain to, in more recent times, the force in Lithuania.  Europol&rsquo;s mandate has been developed particularly in recent years.  Has the organisation developed sufficiently to be able to shoulder that mandate?  At the time of the signing of Treaty of Rome more than 50 years ago it was difficult to imagine that we would be dealing with a Union that would stretch up to the borders of Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine, which were not independent states at that time.  In planning ahead we must contemplate a Union, if Turkey accedes to it, that would stretch from Mizen Head in my constituency to the Siberian steppes and around to North Africa.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be an enormous area with a massive number of people.  I fully support the developments which have taken place in the European Union.  I am more and more enthusiastic about developments such as the European constitution.  Those developments bring enormous challenges for administration control.</P>
        <P>It is important to realise it would bring our borders close to areas where instability is the order of the day.  Places of such instability are a breeding ground for international criminals, some encouraged by state bodies in those countries.  It is incumbent on every member state to ratify the protocols included in the Bill and enshrine them in national legislation as quickly as possible.  I would have preferred this to have been done previously but let us do it quickly now.</P><Col N="1388"/>
        <P>Fine Gael always supports the timely and effective integration into Irish law of international treaties, protocols and agreements to which we are a signatory in line with our international commitments.  The protocols have existed for a number of years and enshrining them in national law is not before time.  Having done so, let us not close the file, but see how much more can be done.  We should actively and significantly contribute on the international stage to any development of Europol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm seans a fh&aacute;il chun p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar an mBille um Europol (Leas&uacute;) 2006.  T&aacute; an Lucht Oibre ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ocht don Bhille.  Beimid ag cabhr&uacute; chun an Bille a chur tr&iacute;d na D&aacute;la go tapaidh.</P>
        <P>The first thought which strikes one when considering the Bill is the length of time it took to bring it before the D&aacute;il.  The three protocols to the Europol Convention to be given effect in Irish law date from 2000, 2002 and 2003 respectively.  As both the Minister and Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe pointed out, crime is becoming increasingly international, sophisticated and difficult for national and international law enforcement agencies to address.</P>
        <P>Needless to say, giving the appropriate means to law enforcement agencies to deal with the activities of modern criminal gangs as speedily as possible is imperative.  It is incredible and completely unacceptable that it took so long to bring before the D&aacute;il the protocol of November 2000 extending the competency of Europol to deal with money laundering regardless of the type of offences from which the proceeds originate.  Taking six years to bring protocols to the D&aacute;il should not be repeated.</P>
        <P>The question arises whether primary legislation should be required in all instances.  Producing primary legislation puts an additional burden on a system which we all wish would produce Bills far more quickly.  If it is possible to avoid the procedures of taking primary legislation through the D&aacute;il and Seanad, we should do so.  Perhaps we should consider enabling legislation so matters such as those in this Bill could be dealt with through less cumbersome procedures.</P>
        <P>I understand this Bill has no implications for national sovereignty.  Where future protocols could have such implications or implications for civil liberties, it is imperative that debates take place in both Houses before final decisions are reached.  In any case, we must increase the speed of parliamentary procedures dealing with protocols to the Europol convention.  The protocols before the House are non-contentious.  The Labour Party will assist and co-operate in their early passage.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the three additional protocols in Irish and English to be added as Schedules to the Europol Act 1997.  I compliment the Minister on the fact the Irish translation of the protocols is included in the Bill. <Col N="1389"/> I recently suggested to his colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, that Departments prepare the Irish version in tandem with the English version so delays in publishing Acts are reduced to a minimum.  The matter arose from a priority question regarding the obligation under the Official Languages Act 2003 enacted on 13 July that Acts of the Oireachtas be published simultaneously in Irish and English.  As the Minister is aware, the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 completed its passage through the Oireachtas on 5 July 2006.  However, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 was not published until 9 October 2006.  I am sure the Minister will agree this was an unacceptable delay and such delays must be eliminated.</P>
        <P>I already complimented the Minister on having the translation of the three protocols contained in the Bill.  What procedures are in place to finalise the translation into Irish of the remainder of the Bill?  Who will translate it?  Was the translation of the protocols carried out within the Department or was outside assistance required?  The explanatory memorandum states the financial implications are minimal.  Does the Minister have a figure for the cost of the translation of the three protocols into Irish?</P>
        <P>Regarding crime and terrorism, we read reports that money emanating from terrorist and gang criminal activity ends up in Dubai.  Are the money laundering proposals before us late in the day?  If the money goes beyond the EU, by definition it goes beyond the reach of Interpol.  Are efforts being made by Interpol to deal more effectively with the fact that money can leave the jurisdiction?</P>
        <P>We are all aware of scams where one receives an e-mail from people allegedly living in African countries.  I understand they all emanate from Amsterdam.  I found it extraordinary that UK police estimate the perpetrators of the scam gain approximately &pound;200 million per annum.  On the face of it, one may think it laughable but it is extremely serious.</P>
        <P>The Minister informed us legislation on human trafficking will be published in the new year and this is very welcome.  Will protocols be developed so this matter can be more effectively addressed?  At present, it seems little regulation or sanction is available.</P>
        <P>Outside elements have become involved in marketing drugs in Ireland.  Much of this activity seems to emanate from outside the borders of the European Union.  How effectively do we pursue it beyond EU borders?</P>
        <P>While the Labour Party welcomes the protocols, something effective must be done urgently to ensure we avoid the delays to which I referred earlier.  I hope these protocols, as ratified by the Government, will be fully effective in Europe in serving their intended purpose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important Bill because it makes sense to have greater international co-<Col N="1390"/>operation in fighting crime.  The downside of having freedom of movement within the European Union is that it has facilitated a big increase in cross-border crime.  In the context of the emergence of the Single Market and the removal of trade barriers, Justice Ministers across the Union have become aware that measures to prevent the exploitation of this freedom of movement by criminals would be needed to protect their citizens from organised crime.</P>
        <P>Europol has contributed to fighting crime.  One need only examine the organisation&rsquo;s website to see the significant successes it has achieved, whether in dealing with counterfeit bank notes in Bogot&aacute; or child trafficking.  This form of international co-operation has a major role to play in the future of the European Union.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, we need strong safeguards regarding the extensive powers we have given and are giving to Europol.  It is answerable to the Council of Justice Ministers and there is a financial audit of the organisation also.  Europol is not completely above criticism, however, and concerns have been expressed over some internal issues in the organisation.  I suppose problems will be encountered in any large organisation which has a significant annual budget and employs hundreds of people.  In general, however, it is important to emphasise the constructive role that Europol has played.  Obviously, there are real issues concerning data retention and information exchange which need to be taken into account in any discussion of the organisation&rsquo;s activities.</P>
        <P>I note that the Bill, when enacted, will give effect in Irish law to three protocols to the Europol arrangements, which the Green Party generally welcomes.  One of the most important areas in which Europol can be of assistance is that of human trafficking.  The trafficking of human beings for labour or sexual exploitation is a serious and rapidly growing worldwide phenomenon.</P>
        <P>The trade in human beings for financial gain is an extremely lucrative business, with traffickers earning several billion euro a year at the expense of innocent lives.  Women&rsquo;s human rights, in particular, are violated when they are bought and sold, raped, falsely imprisoned and tortured.  It is estimated that more than 120,000 women and girls are trafficked into west European countries every year.</P>
        <P>Ireland has failed to transpose into law the 2002 EU Council framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings, which obliged all member states to legislate to criminalise the trafficking of human beings for exploitation.  The deadline for member states to enact this framework legislation was August 2004, over two years ago.  Ireland is the only European Union member state not to have done so.  The Minister has pointed out that the existing legislation is available but it seems odd that Ireland is the only EU member state not to have transposed the 2002 EU Council framework decision on combating <Col N="1391"/>trafficking in human beings.  Europol can do much to address this matter but the fight against human trafficking begins at home.  There is an onus on the Minister to ensure that the framework decision is transposed into domestic law.</P>
        <P>The UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women expressed its concern about the trafficking of women and girls into Ireland, the lack of information on the extent of the problem and of specific legislation in the area, and the lack of a comprehensive strategy to combat it.  The committee recommended the adoption and implementation of a strategy to combat trafficking in women and girls, which should include preventative measures, the prosecution and punishment of offenders, and the enactment of specific legislation in this area.  Women who have come here and are being exploited are concerned that they will be deported if they encounter the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has dealt favourably with such cases to date, we need to enact some legislation to protect such people.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, Europol&rsquo;s first officer in charge of combating trafficking, Steve Harvey, warned that Ireland is likely to be at particular risk of being targeted by people traffickers.  Mr. Harvey also pointed out that trafficking is the one crime that must be combated from a human rights perspective, rather than a singular law enforcement focus.  He said: &ldquo;I cannot emphasise enough that the only way to stop this bloody awful crime is for there to be a multi-agency approach.&rdquo;  Human trafficking is a terrible crime.  It requires cross-border co-operation through all EU member states and beyond.  Europol has a valuable role to play in assisting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat this largely invisible and highly lucrative crime which destroys lives.</P>
        <P>This country has also seen a phenomenal rise in organised gang-related crime.  Fuelled by the massive amounts of money to be made from the trafficking and sale of drugs, gangland crimes have resulted in a dramatic increase in gun-related murders.  One-off Garda initiatives aimed at tackling this problem, such as Operation Anvil and Operation Crossover, are simply not well enough resourced to cope with the highly developed and sophisticated levels of organised criminal activity currently gripping certain parts of the country.</P>
        <P>Europol also has an important role to play in facilitating the exchange of intelligence information on criminal networks among national police forces.  This facilitation will strengthen the ability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to understand how these networks operate and how best to control them.</P>
        <P>We need to have strong controls over how Europol works, including stronger answerability from the organisation.  We should also be particularly sensitive to the retention of data by that body.  Nonetheless, I welcome the protocols before the House today.  We need to be up to <Col N="1392"/>speed with what is happening as regards international crime and Europol has a valuable role to play in this respect.  I am somewhat uneasy about part of Europol&rsquo;s backup legislation, which gives immunity from prosecution to all serving and retired officers attached to the organisation.  On behalf of the Green Party, however, I support the protocols that will be enshrined in law through the enactment of this Bill.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initiative in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and commend the Minister on introducing the matter by way of primary legislation.  There are three elements to the legislation.  First, it will extend the competence of Europol to money-laundering activities regardless of the types of offences from which money-laundering proceeds originate.  Second, it will clarify certain powers concerning the participation in joint investigation teams by members of Europol, and the privileges and immunity applying to members of Europol.  Third, it will streamline the internal workings of Europol, particularly with regard to liaison procedures and the analysis and processing of data.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a few general observations about the operation of Europol.  Everyone in the House will agree with the need for increased co-operation between European police forces, which must be fully supported.  Other Members have mentioned the need to increase such co-operation not only between European police forces, but also internationally, including the USA and other countries.  This is relevant in Ireland because many crimes here have an international dimension with roots in the drugs trade.  This is because the drugs trade is highly profitable and people are willing to be nasty in pursuit of that money.  The drugs come to Ireland from a variety of sources including Colombia, Mexico and Afghanistan, through Turkey into Spain, Holland other European countries.  Unfortunately, guns are now part of this trade which has become more vicious recently.</P>
        <P>This is not an academic debate and people at a local level will wonder how it relates to them.  Gangland feuds in our cities have roots in the drugs trade and most of the disputes that lead to murders stem from disagreements over territorial rights for the sale of drugs in an area.  Mountrath, in my constituency, is halfway between Limerick and Dublin.  Serious criminal gangs operate in those cities and recently Mountrath has emerged as a convenient drop off point for criminals using either the train network or the national primary road network.  The situation is being monitored by the local garda&iacute;.  Right down to small, rural towns the source of the product that leads to these crimes is international.  People must be aware that the issue stretches beyond the big cities to every town and village in Ireland and they should have no qualms about supporting Europol in its efforts to deal with the drugs trade.  There <Col N="1393"/>have been spectacular successes in the past and I hope they continue.</P>
        <P>The issue of money laundering constitutes an important part of this Bill because criminals tend not to leave their money sitting in bank accounts.  Banks watch such activities closely, there is significant money laundering legislation in Ireland and they cannot leave it under the floorboards for long so criminals are compelled to convert cash into property or other business assets.  This legislation is important in tackling such issues because we have all seen the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, in selling properties belonging to convicted criminals in Ireland.  It demonstrates how successful such people have been in establishing businesses and acquiring properties.  The legislation in Ireland and at a European level must allow the police to link such properties to their source and take the necessary action.</P>
        <P>The issue of Europol and police forces sharing information relating to mobile phone conversations may cause some concern.  It was widely publicised in the media that a perpetrator of the London bombings was traced across Europe by using the signal from his mobile phone and the police were waiting for him on his arrival by train in Rome.  This is not confidential security information as I read this in the media.  It is important that such measures be strengthened and improved because people may buy disposable mobile phones, they may not register as the owner of the phone and phones can change hands and be stolen.  Facilities must exist giving the police access to mobile phone conversations.  This is something most law-abiding citizens find unsavoury but, if we are to tackle serious crime, compromise on such issues is necessary.  Legislation must reflect the emergence of new technologies that did not exist a generation previously.  That Irish people involved in the drugs trade have been found dead in places like Spain and Holland only highlights the need for this legislation.</P>
        <P>People are not engaging in money laundering for the good of the drugs trade or to get high on drugs, they do it for the money involved.  I have been encouraged in the past year to see many statutory instruments put before the House by the Minister for Finance regarding seizing or freezing certain bank accounts on foot of requests from the United Nations.  This was carried out by countries throughout the world in order to seize accounts suspected of being held by international terrorists.  Thousands of accounts have been frozen by the Central Bank in Ireland and while this may have caused some difficulties, it is necessary.</P>
        <P>Recent reports have suggested that seemingly innocuous charitable organisations are fronts for sinister people and terrorist groups using Ireland to hide money for the purchase of arms and to finance terrorism.  This must come to an end.</P><Col N="1394"/>
        <P>I fully support this legislation and I believe most crime has an international impact.  Most businesses operate on an international basis so it is inevitable, as the decades pass, that more legislation of this kind will be passed in this House and parliaments across Europe.  Such legislation will bring about greater co-operation and consistency, not only in policing but in sentencing, court procedures and the criminal justice system throughout Europe.  Ultimately we will be compelled to go further afield than the EU because many of the crimes mentioned have their origins outside Europe.</P>
        <P>I look forward to further legislation whereby signatories to the Europol Agreement can expect greater international police co-operation around the world.  I commend the legislation to the House and look forward to its speedy passage.  I hope it leads to the conviction of criminals in Ireland and internationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>As my colleague Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe stated, the Fine Gael Party is always happy to support the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in introducing legislation that will improve crime detection rates in this country.  International and trans-European crime is a serious and increasing problem in Ireland and we have not come to terms with organised crime emanating from gangs in eastern Europe.  The latest proposed expansion of the EU to take in Romania and Bulgaria and the freedom of movement involved will add to this problem, to an extent, and there are serious reservations regarding the extent of organised crime in these countries.  </P>
        <P>We must be concerned by the level of home-grown organised crime and the level of activity in other European countries, particularly Holland and Spain.  We support the Minister in introducing legislation to curb crime but legislation alone will not solve our crime problems.  If this were the case Ireland would be a crime free society by this stage as the Minister has spent so much time and energy putting legislation through the D&aacute;il.  However, without the proper resources legislation cannot succeed and this has been the source of some of our problems recently.</P>
        <P>Resources must be provided to the Garda in the short term and in the long term the underlying causes of crime must be addressed.  This is unlikely to happen under the current Government as the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow.  Resources in education, the most important tool in fighting social injustice, are not being provided in the way necessary to facilitate an atmosphere in communities that would lead to a reduction in crime rates.</P>
        <P>The Minister has introduced a raft of legislation but we have yet to see the type of resources provided to the Garda that would make it as successful as it could be.  The Minister&rsquo;s handling of various issues, specifically the introduction of the Garda reserve force, has eroded Garda confi<Col N="1395"/>dence in the administration of law and caused problems in the police structure.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael Party has long argued that community policing is essential.  Unless crime is tackled at source by providing social solutions to community problems and preventing crime through community policing, we will not make substantial gains in fighting crime.</P>
        <P>International crime fighting is different and our efforts in this area will depend to a large extent on how well the national police force is resourced.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will require a range of resources if it is to participate adequately in international policing.  To communicate properly with Interpol and make best use of the enhanced co-operation proposed in the Bill, the force must be given additional resources, including new technologies and staff with language and technical skills.</P>
        <P>If the concept of the European co-operation is to be successful and the activities of the Garda are to be integrated with Interpol, substantial resources and imagination will be necessary.  Most European police forces have been fighting organised crime for many years and have acquired experience, structures and state-of-the-art equipment to deal with the type of criminal involved in it.  This type of crime is relatively new here because the Garda has only dealt with the international dimension of crime for the past decade.  If the section of the Garda dealing with international crime is as badly resourced as the general force, we still have a great deal of ground to make up.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate that the Garda, in co-operation with other European forces, recently achieved some notable successes, particularly in the area of drug seizures, organised crime is extremely sophisticated.  International criminals employ the latest technology and have access to people with language skills and vast experience in international business and banking transactions.  By matching the resources and personnel available to organised crime, many European police forces have become more effective in tackling this type of crime.</P>
        <P>Until recently, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not require the specialised resources needed to fight organised crime because of our island status.  To ensure the force will be able to maintain good, high level contacts with its European counterparts, it must be provided with sufficient funding to procure state-of-the-art technology and employ personnel with language and technical skills or experience in banking and international business.  Judging by the Government&rsquo;s track record, it will be many years before these resources are made available.  The Minister must recognise that, given Ireland&rsquo;s geographical position and relative lack of experience in fighting organised crime when compared to countries such as Italy or Bulgaria, he must immediately make significant resources available to the Garda. <Col N="1396"/> I welcome the decision by the Garda Commissioner and Minister to establish a specialised unit to deal with organised crime and liaise and co-operate with Interpol.  This new departure for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will require substantial investment in training.</P>
        <P>The European Union has never been so vulnerable to criminal elements who will use freedom of movement to maximise their ill-gotten gains in the trafficking of drugs, guns and human beings.  Europe&rsquo;s close proximity to Russia and Africa also gives easier access to criminal elements from these regions.  Given that the problem of international crime extends far beyond Europe, the Government must provide resources to adequately deal with the problem.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect in Irish law to three protocols to the Europol Convention 1995, namely, the protocols of 30 November 2000, 28 November 2002 and 27 November 2003.  The first of these extends the competence of Europol to money laundering regardless of the origins of the laundered proceeds.  The second clarifies certain powers regarding participation in joint investigation teams by members of Europol and the privileges and immunity applying to members of Europol, while the third streamlines the internal working of Europol, particularly in liaison procedures and the analysis and processing of data.</P>
        <P>Europol supports law enforcement activities of members states, primarily those directed at illicit drug trafficking; illegal immigration networks; terrorism; forgery of money, including counterfeiting of the euro and other means of payment; trafficking in human beings; child pornography; illicit vehicle trafficking; and money laundering.  Its other main priorities include crimes against persons, financial crimes and cyber-crime where an organised criminal structure is involved in two or more member states.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to address in detail the other provisions of the Bill as the Minister covered them adequately.  The Europol (Amendment) Bill 2006 will amend  the Europol Act 1997, which was introduced to enable Ireland to ratify the 1995 Europol convention and additional protocols of 24 July 1996 and 19 June 1997.  The amendment provided for in the Bill will enable Ireland to ratify three additional protocols of 30 November 2000, 28 November 2002 and 27 November 2003.  The protocols provide for, respectively, the extension of the competence of Europol to money laundering regardless of the origins of the proceeds, clarification on participation in joint investigation teams by members of Europol and the privileges and immunities applying to members of Europol, and streamlining the internal workings of Europol, particularly on data protection.</P>
        <P>Since the failure of negotiations on the draft European constitution, the European Commission has been examining various approaches to harmonising laws in member states with a view to transferring to the Commission and Parliament <Col N="1397"/>powers currently vested in the Council of Ministers.  There is no doubt that difference in member states&rsquo; judicial systems hinder the effective implementation of law and the fight against crime.  The Fine Gael Party supports the Minister&rsquo;s position that no further justice powers should be transferred to the Commission and Parliament until such time as a comprehensive constitution for Europe has been agreed.</P>
        <P>Appearing before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights yesterday, the Minister admitted that bilateral co-operation between Ireland and many of our neighbours and potential new neighbours is not as good as it should be.  In many instances it is questionable if there is any contact at all between the Garda and some of these police forces.</P>
        <P>Bearing this in mind, there must be a change in the mindset that exists within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It must realise the implications for the future of trans-European and international crime and must set up systems to allow contact with police forces in every country where the potential for the spreading of organised crime into or out of Ireland exists.  If our gang leaders are becoming richer as a result of involvement in organised crime in Europe, they will continue to cause major problems in this country.  I urge the Minister to recognise that the garda&iacute; are moving into a new area and that it will be difficult for them to deal with other languages and legal systems.  A huge number of new personnel with specialised knowledge in languages, law and business systems in other European countries will be needed if this system is to be effective.</P>
        <P>Having said that, we will continue to support any measures the Minister introduces to honour our commitments at European level or any laws that will facilitate the enforcement of the law in this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like most Deputies, I support this Bill.  I cannot imagine a situation where people would not want co-operation in our common interest.  The explanatory memoranda to the Bill, however, point out that it gives effect to protocols, some of which are six years old, and is largely a technical Bill.  We also do not appear to be in any hurry to pass it.  Given that we are likely to receive more support than we can offer, we should have displayed more enthusiasm for this Bill and its passage &mdash; it would not meet any resistance.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Recently, the media have reported on the exposure we might face.  Our geography means we are isolated and exposed with limited systems compared to other countries to protect ourselves so we have much to gain from this development.  Closer co-operation on security issues must, therefore, be welcomed but there must also be safeguards for our citizens.  We must strike the right balance and the Data Protection Act has a role to play in this regard.</P><Col N="1398"/>
        <P>The Bill covers several different areas, including money laundering, regardless of the type of offence.  We have seen the Criminal Assets Bureau operate across a broad spectrum.  It started out with the drugs issue but has gone beyond that and its members have displayed great bravery in making it such a success.  It demonstrated that good policing is not just about swapping information.  It is about prevention and headline crimes not taking place, with systems in place for more than simple co-operation.  While the primary focus at the start of CAB&rsquo;s existence was the drug barons, it had wider significance.</P>
        <P>That success notwithstanding, it is a matter of concern that drugs are being imported in such large quantities.  I try not to be extreme in what I say but I am alarmed at the amount of cocaine available in my constituency.  That will be a cause of money laundering in future because it has not been seriously tackled.  Although drugs such as ecstasy and cannabis were available, cocaine use is now much more widespread than ever before.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the recent drugs hauls, which were the largest in the history of the State.  The attempt to smuggle &euro;10 million worth of drugs into Ireland from Belgium at Weston Aerodrome is particularly worrying.  That was foiled through co-operation but the airfield was seen as a soft target.  I asked questions earlier this year because we realised it was a soft target.  There were 18 customs checks in 12 months, ten of which were previously announced, at that airfield, which has a high level of traffic.  This was evident to me and those living near the airfield, who can go to the very edge of the airfield and watch passengers disembarking and getting into taxis.  It is marketed on the aerodrome&rsquo;s website that from touchdown to taxi or limousine takes fives minutes, which advertises the lack of security.  We are sleepwalking on this issue.</P>
        <P>Streamlining liaison and data analysis will require resources but it is still not possible to e-mail a Garda station &mdash; faxes must be sent instead.  If we are talking about relationships between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and European police forces, we must invest in the technology most people use today.</P>
        <P>I can see no reason that Operation Airways has not been re-established.  Small aircraft are now much more widely available than was the case ten years ago and we must move with the times.  The lack of protection at small airfields needs serious attention.  We must prevent the importation of drugs which, in turn, will have an effect on crime rates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I support all measures that maximise co-operation on a European scale between law enforcement agencies.  Its necessity has been brought home to us with the recent threats against Dublin Airport and, presumably, Shannon Airport.  Such international co-operation is essential.</P><Col N="1399"/>
        <P>The Minister outlined the main types of organised crime that must be tackled through this legislation, such as money laundering, which is linked to drug dealing when we consider the tens of millions of euro being made in this country from that trade.  Much of the money is being laundered outside the country.  Some of our leading drug dealers are now based outside this country in Britain, Amsterdam and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister is here and I can bring to his attention an issue I am sure he is very conscious of, the scale of the drugs problem, even over the past year.  I remember raising this issue in the House in the early 1980s and I was repeatedly told in D&aacute;il replies that the level of seizures was small, and the level of seizures determined the extent of the problem on the street.  Therefore, the problem was under control because the amounts of heroin being taken were quite small.  If that is translated into today&rsquo;s context &mdash; Deputy Catherine Murphy has drawn attention to it &mdash; we have had two seizures of heroin in the past two months, one worth &euro;11 million and another prior to that in Ratoath with heroin worth &euro;7 million.  That is absolutely without precedent in the past 30 years in the State.  Despite the significant drugs crisis which has enveloped many communities over that time, we have never seen amounts of heroin on such a scale.  It almost constitutes a national emergency.</P>
        <P>If, as we are repeatedly told, seizures represent between 12% and 14% of availability on the streets, such an amount representing 12% of availability at any one time on the streets means we are in big trouble.  I know from my involvement in a community policing forum in the Store Street Garda district, where I attended a meeting a little over a week ago, that the garda&iacute; in recent months are again seizing heroin right across the city.  We all thought that was a thing of the past, that cocaine had eclipsed the drug to some degree and more cocaine was being seized, but heroin has made a recovery in a major way.  I do not know if there are international reasons for this or if the situation in Afghanistan and so on is responsible for it, but what I know comes from the hard evidence of Garda seizures.  There are massive amounts of the most deadly drug, heroin, available in this State.</P>
        <P>I am unsure whether the Government has a strategy to respond to this problem or whether the Minister has considered what more must be done.  I remember arguing in this House on many occasions prior to the murder of Veronica Guerin with a variety of Ministers for Justice, including former Deputy Nora Owen, that a need existed to bring different agencies together.  These would include the investigation branch of the Department responsible for social welfare, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda etc.  Although everybody thought it was a great idea, nobody seemed able to bring it about.</P><Col N="1400"/>
        <P>The community organisation in my area, which I was involved in, actually went to those agencies and brought them together.  Each one of those agencies felt it was a bad idea to set up a unified grouping to target drugs, assets etc.  They felt they could, as individual agencies, do it and that they were doing it, but they clearly were not doing it.  They resisted to the bitter end the idea of coming together until Veronica Guerin was murdered and the Government demanded new strategies.  The Criminal Assets Bureau was one such strategy.</P>
        <P>It is a great disappointment to me when I see people trafficking in heroin in some of the poorer areas of my constituency in the inner city all these years after the Criminal Assets Bureau was set up.  These people are trafficking at a low to middle level.  Girlfriends of these people are driving around in 2006 jeeps while claiming social welfare.  I see individuals charged with possessing very large amounts of cocaine still wandering in and claiming social welfare, while they live in affluent apartments, for which they are probably claiming rent subsidies.</P>
        <P>The whole idea of the Criminal Assets Bureau, as I understood it, and the argument for it was to prevent that happening, but it has had no impact whatever on such incidents in the areas where these drug dealers operate.  I have raised the matter with the Minister in the past and I have raised it in the House on a number of occasions.  There is a need to proactively review the operations of the Criminal Assets Bureau and to localise and regionalise it so that operatives from the Criminal Assets Bureau are in the areas where drugs are a major problem to prevent this type of scandal from happening.  Everybody in the community can see these operations and are aware of the problem.  Other young people may see such drug operations and if they think money is that easy to come by in dealing drugs, they might ask themselves why they should not get involved.  It is attracting young people all the time for that reason.  We can see the scale it is at now.  The problem has spread throughout the suburbs and it is spreading throughout the country, yet there does not appear to be any strategic view of what is happening and how to tackle the problem.</P>
        <P>We know how to tackle it, but responses have not been structured or put in place in the areas where they are needed.  I again ask the Minister to consider this area and see what can be done.  What is in place currently has not been effective, which is clear from the scale of the problem.  We are aware of the large increase in the availability of drugs.</P>
        <P>I referred to a number of recent seizures of significant amounts of drugs.  In that context, it is a great credit to the Garda drug squads that they are able to make such seizures and get such an amount of drugs off the streets.  I do not want to finish without mentioning that.  However, those amounts reflect the problem.  They tell us what we already know, that there is a massive problem <Col N="1401"/>out there.  My difficulty is that, despite us knowing the problem is there and its ingredients, we are not tackling it in the way we indicated we would.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has raised for the past year an equally blatant scandal in this area, where jets are flying into private aerodromes day in and day out without customs or Garda cover.  The Deputy has seen it herself and she has graphically described people getting off these jets and straight into a taxi with their bags.  I do not know if it was the Garda or the Belgian authorities, but between the two they stopped &euro;10 million of heroin going on to an aeroplane in Belgium.  That amount of drugs would have been carried down the steps from that privately-owned luxury jet and into a waiting cab or car in Weston Aerodrome.  Yet we say we are serious about the drugs problem.  I hope that issue is being dealt with.</P>
        <P>Deputy Catherine Murphy raised an issue on which I put down a parliamentary question some time ago, the incredible position where the Garda authorities are not currently accessible through e-mail.  People throughout my constituency contact me every day, and e-mail is the most frequently used contact I have in my office.  Constituents living in the area contact me by e-mail and it is a nonsense that I cannot contact a Garda superintendent or chief superintendent by e-mail.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will take on board some of the ideas referred to by both Deputy Catherine Murphy and I.  We are referring to them in a positive way because we want them taken on board by the Minister and we want something done.  We want to see the State agencies being effective against these people who are killing at will &mdash; as is evident every few weeks &mdash; because they believe they can get away with it and because of the huge sums of money they are earning from the drugs scene.  It is one of the most destructive forces and activities in my constituency and in others throughout the State.  I hope the issues we have raised will be carefully considered and perhaps acted upon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  It was almost inevitable that the debate would be wide-ranging because the Bill is a narrow, technical piece of legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and Gerard Murphy for their supportive approach to the legislation.  I also thank Deputy O&rsquo;Shea for his comments.  I accept his criticisms of two things: first, the delay in dealing with and in enacting these protocols into Irish law; and, second, that it would be preferable that, rather than enacting primary legislation on matters of this kind every so often, we should adopt some different approach to getting relatively technical matters enacted into Irish law.  It is a matter of regret to me that it could not have been done, for example, <Col N="1402"/>by a statutory instrument or that there is not some procedure whereby on a fast track basis, something could be laid before a committee of the House and the protocols amended without going through the full panoply of two Houses considering the matter.  However, because the contributions to this debate have been wide-ranging, it has not been time wasted.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with Deputies Gerard Murphy, Catherine Murphy and Gregory and other Deputies that we are on a learning curve.  I fully agree with Deputies Gregory and Catherine Murphy that the principles were already established in the CAB events of ten years&rsquo; ago, the requirement for inter-agency operations was clearly established and the benefits of such an approach have been clearly demonstrated in the interval.</P>
        <P>Deputy Catherine Murphy is absolutely right about aerodromes.  Responsibility to regulate aerodromes falls between different Departments.  They are licensed by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen&rsquo;s Department and the provision of customs and excise is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s Department, while my Department is responsible for the policing aspect.  The fact that three major Departments are involved in that particular activity does not mean that there is not a very strong case for clear co-ordination of activity.  I do not dispute Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s assertion.  If private aerodromes are not being adequately policed &mdash; I use the term to mean inspections, customs arrangements and the monitoring of who is using what aircraft and for what purpose &mdash; that must be addressed, but I do not wish to close them down because they are a very useful facility.  They are part of the world we live in but they cannot be an open porthole for people to access Ireland without any adequate safeguards.</P>
        <P>There is a very strong case for institutionalised co-operation between Customs and Excise, private and public airport authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will take up the points made by the Deputies on that matter.  Within the week, I will commence a process within my Department to audit the actions being taken.  As Deputy Gregory expressed, I hope it will not happen just now.  I hope the powers that be, so to speak, have been doing these things without prompting from politicians.  I presume the intelligence-gathering authorities in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in Customs and Excise have been examining these problems but I want reassurance on that point.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, the public are entitled to reassurance.  What appears to be lax procedure must be examined very carefully.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Gregory made some very sobering points about drugs in our society.  I agree with his argument.  It is right, as he did, to acknowledge the great successes with regard to drugs seizures.  I also wish to pay tribute to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I must be careful to strike a balance between acknowledging their successes but also acknowl<Col N="1403"/>edging the scale of the problem with which they must deal.  They are dealing with forces which have frightening amounts of resources, brutality and determination.  It is the case that we must do better with regard to all these matters.  I fully accept Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s point that there is absolutely no room to assume that everything being done is sufficient or even remotely sufficient.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of resources.  As the day unfolds, it will be clear that record resources are being given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The finances and numbers available to the force are growing at a dramatic level.  I do not wish to do what happened in other sectors, which is to throw money and people into a system which itself needs strategic direction.  There is much talk about Garda reform in terms of systems and governance, but we also need within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a very clear picture that the resources are being translated into maximum value and return for the taxpayer.  All those things are being done.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gregory has raised on a number of occasions the question of the escape from an open prison of a drug dealer who is prominent in his community.  He had previously absconded from a closed prison.  I note publicity about this subject in today&rsquo;s newspapers.  I wish to reassure the Deputy that I have not forgotten the matter and I will be looking for an explanation.  It requires a personal explanation from the people who made the decision as to precisely what they thought they were doing.  It is not a matter I am willing to let go.  If somebody with convictions for drug dealing absconds from a closed prison and is then transferred to an open prison, many questions must be asked as to the reason that person was selected for an open prison.  I want explanations and I assure the Deputy I will get them.  I am not leaving that one go.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank all the Deputies for participating in the debate on the Bill.  I acknowledge Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s support for the proposal.  I accept the legitimate criticism that this legislation should have been dealt with earlier.  The Department is aware of this criticism, but it is better late than never.  This legislation is necessary to enable Ireland to ratify and give full effect to the protocols.  I do not want Ireland to be a stumbling block towards greater co-operation in these matters in the European Union.  I thank Deputies for their contributions, particularly those on all sides of the House who spoke about the important issues that lie at the heart of this and why this intelligence must be gathered and exchanged.  I assure them I am conscious of the strong arguments that have been put and the force of the contributions made.  They are not falling on deaf ears.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group and the new mandate for Shannon Development, the indigenous industry support functions carried out by Shannon Development, under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland, will revert to Enterprise Ireland on 1 January 2007.  The reversion of these functions will also involve the transfer of approximately 40 staff from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative basis to designate the transfer of the individual staff members concerned and provide a statutory guarantee to the staff who are so designated that their pay, conditions of service and pension arrangements shall not be diminished by virtue of the transfer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The context for the new arrangements for indigenous enterprise is that by the start of 2005 a range of developments had occurred which necessitated a review of the role of Shannon Development.  These included the enterprise strategy group recommendation, accepted by <Col N="1405"/>Government, that Shannon Development&rsquo;s enterprise development functions should be brought within the remit of the national enterprise development agencies; the establishment of an independent Shannon Airport Authority; the proposed relocation of the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland to Shannon as part of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme; the transfer of responsibility for Shannon town from Shannon Development to Clare County Council; and the abolition of the licensing requirement for companies setting up in the Shannon Free Zone.</P>
        <P>Against the background of these developments, I asked Shannon Development to submit proposals to me for a new strategy for the company.  These proposals, which included exiting the role of support for indigenous enterprises, are reflected in the new mandate I have authorised for the company.  Shannon Development will now have a more focussed strategic role on the broader regional economic development of the Shannon region.  The company will work in partnership with key public and private sector organisations in the region to identify and bring forward new initiatives, projects and programmes to maximise the development potential of the region and help create a viable counter-pole to the more developed eastern region.  In this context I have specifically instructed the company to give priority to addressing the needs of less developed parts of the region.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development will use its extensive property portfolio, located throughout the region, as a lever to drive the delivery of the economic development infrastructure that is essential for regional development.  The company will also continue to work closely with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in identifying and addressing the property needs of both indigenous and FDI companies and in promoting the Shannon Free Zone as a location for foreign direct investment.  The company&rsquo;s activities as the regional tourism authority for the Shannon region will also continue to have a key role to play in the economic development of the region.</P>
        <P>I have recently approved a new three-year corporate plan for the company which reflects the terms of the new mandate.  The specific activities that Shannon Development will undertake will be selected on the basis of its potential to generate significant economic impact locally, regionally and nationally.  For example, included in the plan are projects such as the e-towns initiative, designed to build the knowledge economy of the Shannon region, the development of the Kerry deepwater zone and the regeneration of the Shannon Free Zone as a location for high value added, knowledge age investment.  Shannon Development is uniquely placed to meet the challenge of regional economic development and specifically to maximise the development potential of the Shannon region in line with the objectives of the national spatial strategy.  For more than four decades, initiatives developed and <Col N="1406"/>delivered by the company have been adopted and reproduced successfully in Ireland and internationally.  With the more focussed remit that it now has, the company will be in a position to meet the new challenges the region faces.</P>
        <P>The reversion of responsibility for indigenous enterprises support to Enterprise Ireland will also provide a more logical delineation of responsibilities between the two agencies in the mid-west region.  As the support programmes currently provided by Shannon Development to enterprise clients in the region are operated under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland, and provision has been made for Shannon Development staff to transfer with the functions, it is anticipated the transition to the new arrangements will be seamless from the perspective of the company&rsquo;s clients.  As Enterprise Ireland is a significantly larger organisation than Shannon Development, the staff who will transfer from Shannon Development will consequently have access to more career development opportunities.</P>
        <P>I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill which are set out in a new section 21A to the Industrial Development Act 1993.  These provisions are based on numerous precedents for transferring staff between statutory bodies.  Subsection (1) of the new section contains a number of definitions.  Subsection (2) is an enabling provision.  It provides legislative authority to designate the transfer of staff from Shannon Development to Forf&aacute;s.  Forf&aacute;s is the legal employer of the staff in the three agencies established under the Industrial Development Acts, namely, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  Subsection (3) provides that staff designated for transfer by the Minister will be appointed to the staff of Forf&aacute;s.  Section 3 of the Bill subsequently amends the Second Schedule to the 1993 Act to include staff transferred from Shannon Development, in the categories of staff that Forf&aacute;s may second to the agencies.  Subsections (4) and (5) of the new section contain the terms of the guarantee that is being provided to the Shannon Development staff who will be designated for transfer.  Specifically it provides that staff who are designated for transfer may not receive a lesser scale of pay or be subject to any less favourable conditions of service than they were entitled to in Shannon Development.  The superannuation benefits of the staff concerned may not be less favourable than those to which they were entitled to in Shannon Development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has been normal practice to include the type of provisions contained in this Bill in legislation providing for the reorganisation of State agencies.  In this instance no new body is being established and both Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development will continue to operate as separate agencies, each with its own distinct remit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Shannon Development and Enterprise Ireland are well advanced in identifying the number of posts to be transferred.  Shannon Development staff and their representatives are engaging posi<Col N="1407"/>tively with the process and I understand that a strong level of interest is being expressed by staff in transferring to Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has also recently announced that it intends to move both its regional development headquarters and the newly established city and county enterprise boards unit to Shannon.  Enterprise Ireland plans to have interim office accommodation in Shannon to accommodate both the Shannon Development staff and the regional headquarters staff by mid-2007.  It is anticipated that approximately 70 Enterprise Ireland staff will transfer into this new accommodation as soon as it is available.</P>

	<P>Fine Gael supports this Bill.  In accordance with the new mandate for Shannon Development, announced by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in July 2005, the indigenous industry functions carried out by Shannon Development under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland will revert to Enterprise Ireland on 1 January 2007.  This is in line with the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group as endorsed by Government.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide legislative authority for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to designate the transfer of staff from Shannon Development to Forf&aacute;s and to provide a statutory guarantee to the staff that their pay, conditions of service and pension arrangements shall be in no way diminished by virtue of the transfer.

        <P Just="Left">The subject of this Bill is one that is very close to me as it directly relates to Shannon Development, an agency which has historic associations with County Clare and is based in Shannon town.  Traditionally it has had functions throughout the mid-west stretching to parts of Offaly and covering Clare, north Tipperary, Limerick and north Kerry.  It is unfortunate that so much time has gone by since the Minister originally made the announcement 16 months ago that he was stripping Shannon Development of these traditional enterprise creation functions.  It was a decision I condemned at the time, not just because of the manner in which it was announced &mdash; the crucial decision was buried in a press release &mdash; but also because it was done in the middle of the summer when it was most likely to receive least attention.  The original decision was made in July 2005 amid widespread criticism, and last month Deputy Martin chose to do a partial U-turn on the issue and decided to allow Shannon Development to retain its enterprise functions within the Shannon Free Zone.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Shannon Development on its recent announcement that Digital River will provide 350 jobs over the next five years in the <Col N="1408"/>Shannon Free Zone.  Shannon Development is to be complimented on that because Mr. Kevin Thompstone and his team have gone to great lengths throughout Europe and the world to find industry suitable to the region and Digital River will be a welcome asset.  In between the original decision and its reversal the relevant agencies were left in a limbo about who was responsible for what.  That indecision created much uncertainty in the region with few new job announcements.  Some 16 months of potential enterprise creation have been wasted through Government indecision and messing.</P>
        <P>The original decision to strip Shannon Development of its enterprise creation functions was made under the cover of &ldquo;an enhanced regional economic development role&rdquo; for the agency.  Deputy Martin also stated at the time that &ldquo;Shannon Development supports this recommendation and it will be implemented as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  That was a surprising statement then, and seemed even more surprising last month when Deputy Martin rowed back on the decision.  Not only has none of the enterprise strategy group recommendations been implemented, but it has taken a year for the legislation to catch up.  It shows that enterprise creation in Clare is in a mess.  It is also doubtful that Shannon Development originally supported the decision if it is retaining enterprise creation in the Shannon Free Zone.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that a core expertise of Shannon Development is being retained at the Shannon Free Zone.  There must be a renewed focus on enterprise creation in the remainder of the county.  As I pointed out to the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business recently, Ennis is in danger of becoming a dormitory town while the outlying towns of north, west and east Clare could all do with an employment boost.  One good employer in Ennistymon is doing well.  It is a digital company that exports signs all over Europe and the world.  Ennis in particular is suffering from a stream of job losses and I would welcome some renewed efforts from both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in reversing some of the losses we have seen in recent years.</P>
        <P>Since 2001, 275 jobs in IDA-supported companies in Ennis have been lost with the closure of Overland Bolling, Studio Eyewear, Pacific Scientific, Tool &amp; Mould, and, most recently, Microsemi.  In the wider county there has been a net loss of 164 jobs in IDA-supported companies since 2000.  Nationally, in the past five years more than 33,000 manufacturing jobs have relocated from Ireland to more competitive economies and more than twice that number of jobs, that might have located in Ireland, have not come.</P>
        <P>The danger that Ennis and similar towns face around the country is that such losses will continue and that this trickle effect will not be reversed with any significant new announcement or policy decision.  The Government&rsquo;s recent approval of large price hikes in gas and electricity <Col N="1409"/>in the absence of a proactive jobs policy is at best misguided and foolhardy, and at worst irresponsible.  There is an urgent need for co-ordinated efforts between several Departments.  The Government is making our economy less competitive and driving manufacturing industry out of Ireland into more competitive countries.</P>
        <P>The recently announced price increases will also hit the already hard-pressed domestic consumer on top of the existing burden of high mortgages, long commute times, and high child care costs, all of which will fully impact only in mid-2007.  We should not and cannot allow the destruction of our manufacturing industry here in the same way the Government has allowed the destruction of the sugar beet industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a welcome development that Shannon Development and Enterprise Ireland are now well advanced in identifying the number of posts to be transferred and that Shannon Development staff and their representatives are engaging positively with the process.  This is happening in parallel with a redundancy programme which I hope is offering new opportunities to former Shannon Development staff.  Those staying on have expressed strong interest in transferring to Enterprise Ireland.  However I question whether the decentralisation programme, particularly for Enterprise Ireland, will ever happen.  The Minister said early in his statement that regional offices will be established in the Shannon region and that is welcome.  However, Members should remember that the decentralisation of Enterprise Ireland to Shannon was announced by then Minister, Mr. McCreevy, in the 2003 budget.  This has not happened.  Only approximately 19 jobs were taken up in this at the time and we recently learned that Enterprise Ireland is to move to new headquarters in Dublin with a long lease of 25 years.  Enterprise Ireland is one of the least developed decentralisation programmes, in contrast to the movement of Revenue staff to Kilrush in west Clare.  I hope this will happen in the near future.  Introducing 50 jobs to west Clare is important and will boost the region, where not many jobs are available.  We have BillPost, which has been successful.  I commend the management on its recent work.  I have learned that it is to move into the Revenue office and that will boost Kilrush.</P>
        <P>I urge the enactment of this legislation before the end of the year to facilitate the transfer of staff from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland.  At the same time, responsibility for indigenous industry support functions will transfer from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland on 1 January.  My party will support this Bill.  Two weeks ago I attended a launch of E-Town in Milltown Malbay.  This is an initiative by Shannon Development allowing people to work from their homes.  The first of these projects has taken off in Milltown Malbay recently and I wish the project success so that broadband can penetrate into regional towns <Col N="1410"/>throughout County Clare and the mid-west.  The lack of broadband is a handicap for people who want to work from home in their areas. especially when one compares it to the 95% broadband penetration in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>As I said, my party will support this Bill.  The legislative provisions are based on numerous precedents for transferring staff between public bodies and I welcome the fact they provide a statutory guarantee and that there will be no diminution in the pay or service conditions of Shannon Development staff when they transfer to Forf&aacute;s.  It had been proposed to introduce these legislative changes through an amendment to the Industrial Development Act 1993, to be effected by way of a Committee Stage amendment to the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill on 28 September.  However, as this was not possible for procedural reasons, the only feasible option to enable the staff to transfer at the same time that the functions will revert on 1 January 2007 is to introduce the legislative provisions by way of a stand-alone Bill before the end of the year.  In line with the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group, the new mandate for Shannon Development also provides that the IDA will assume responsibility for promoting investment in and providing ongoing support to foreign direct investment companies in the Shannon Free Zone.  The reversion of functions relating to indigenous enterprises from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland at this late stage needs to be prioritised.</P>
        <P>I hope the Bill is enacted quickly.  We welcome it and hope the mistakes by this Government on Shannon Development will be rectified giving the IDA a proper job creation role in the mid-west region so we can boost the economy in this fine region.  Shannon Airport, in the middle of the region, is an engine for growing jobs in the region.  I hope Shannon Development will be successful in the near future.</P>

	<P>While the Bill is relatively short with quite simple content, it represents an historical moment for Shannon Development and it would do no harm to use some of my speaking time to acknowledge its work over the years.  Especially worthy of praise has been Shannon Development&rsquo;s innovative approach to regional development, which did not exist in Ireland until the body was created.  Shannon Development has provided an excellent example of what can be done where there is a regional focus.  I pay tribute to the current chief executive, Mr. Kevin Thompstone, his predecessors and the staff who have worked and will continue to work in Shannon Development.  Given that the Bill represents a milestone in many ways, it is a good time mark the company&rsquo;s record.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many positive developments in the mid west, due in no small measure to the work of Shannon Development, have been innovative but they <Col N="1411"/>have not happened in other parts of the country.  It is a pity we have not followed the regional model elsewhere in Ireland rather than pursued the destruction of regionalism through the creation of various forms of boundaries.  The House should consider the example of the Shannon region for which the Shannon Free Airport Development Company has responsibility.  The political geography for voters in the part of County Clare just outside Limerick city which is in my constituency requires them to vote in local elections in Clare County Council&rsquo;s area, general elections in Limerick East and European elections in Connaught-Ulster.  Their situation is just one example of the craziness of regional divisions politically in Ireland, but such divisions pose problems in other ways.  Regional authorities are broadly based on what were the original regions in Ireland while the HSE administers larger regional areas than were administered under the health board system.  My constituency is in the western area for HSE purposes.  Traditionally we have considered the mid-west to be composed of Limerick city and county, Clare and north Tipperary, but Breastcheck for Limerick people will be run from Cork while for Clare people the service will be run from Galway.  These examples are indicative of the obstacles to proper regional planning in Ireland, a problem we need to address.  The model we had in the Shannon region was an excellent one which should have been maintained and extended to the rest of the country instead of being destroyed.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains specific provisions which relate to the return from 1 January 2007 to Enterprise Ireland of functions assigned to Shannon Development.  As Deputy Pat Breen outlined, serious political and other objections were made initially to the proposals the effect of which would be to deprive SFADCO of its wealth and powers through the removal of the Shannon Free Zone from its remit.  SFADCO would have been left with few resources with which to carry out its initiatives.  Thankfully, the policy was reversed on foot of the pressure brought to bear on the Government, which had every intention of going ahead with its original proposal but had to respond to local demands.  The original decision was intended to sustain and prevent the bankruptcy of Shannon Airport on its detachment from Aer Rianta by taking money from regional development, which is no way to do business.  The Labour Party has opposed that approach and would not have supported the Bill had its provisions included the removal of the zone from Shannon Development.</P>
        <P>While the staff of Shannon Development will do what is required of them under the new legislation and are anxious to continue to do the good job they always have, they are somewhat concerned that there is a lack of clarity about their enterprise mandate for the future.  I noted in the Minister&rsquo;s speech his contention that Shannon <Col N="1412"/>Development will now have a more focused strategic role on the broader economic and regional development of the Shannon region; and will work in partnership with key public and private sector organisations in the region to identify and promote new initiatives, projects and programmes to maximise the development potential of the region and help to create a viable counter-pole to the more developed east.  The policy is welcome in many ways.  The current trend in development is good for neither the eastern region nor the western part of the country.  The east cannot cope with the demands of its population on road and other infrastructure.  The M50 is a prime example of the pressure on eastern infrastructure and it will be an even better one when the Dublin Port tunnel is opened.</P>
        <P>It would be positive for everybody if a balance were struck between the east and west.  Those of us who represent western constituencies have argued consistently for more Government attention to our needs.  Western rail and road corridors to connect the west with the south east through Limerick would represent a means of connecting the rest of the country; all roads should not lead to Dublin.  However, the Government has persisted in thinking that while we should all be linked by great roads to Dublin, there is no great urgency about linking us to each other in the west and south east.  Shannon Development and universities in the west, mid west and south have proposed these links and advanced a blueprint to strengthen them to provide people in the regions with what they need.  If one is to nominate gateways and formulate a strategic plan, one is required to provide the resources to make those policies effective.  While Shannon Development is in a position to play a very positive role in this context, it must be provided with the clout and teeth to be effective, which means the provision of resources.  According to Government spending proposals, however, approximately 90% of resources for infrastructure will be provided in the eastern side of the country.  This policy is unacceptable and will perpetuate developmental imbalance by failing to recognise and address the needs of the west.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Shannon Development has been very involved in planning a rail link to Shannon Airport from the Ennis-Limerick line.  While a feasibility study is being carried out, Transport 21 contains no commitment to provide the money to construct the line should its viability be established, which I have no doubt it will.  There is a great deal of potential for expanding rail infrastructure, not only through a western rail corridor but through the development of commuter services in Limerick along the Ballybrophy line to north Tipperary, the Foynes line to west Limerick and the Ennis line with connections to Shannon.  Stations should be built at places like Moyross and other parts of the city which are adjacent to local railway lines.  Shannon Development has played a key role in developing many useful con<Col N="1413"/>cepts and needs to know it will have the clout and resources it needs to continue its work.  People in the mid-west need to know if the region generally is to get the resources it requires also.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development has also been involved in the infrastructural project on waterways development.  I note that the Ulster Canal is to receive funding which should make it possible to travel from Belfast to Limerick and on to the Atlantic by inland waterway.  There are obstacles which must be addressed if this is to happen.  For example, Shannon Development have been considering the opening of the Erina Canal to allow boats to bypass Ardnacrusha.  While these projects are of future rather than immediate concern, we are used to planning ahead in the mid west, not least because we have had the services of Shannon Development.  We are used to thinking ahead and developing innovative strategies as Shannon Development has proved.  I hope it will be given the power and resources to continue to operate in that way.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Pat Breen referred to the number of jobs lost in global companies in Clare.  A similar problem exists in Limerick city and county.  We must focus on jobs for people in the mid-west.  Shannon Development and the higher education institutes in the region are involved in networking in respect of research and development.  When funding for higher education research projects was announced recently a network was set up between University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Mary Immaculate College and Tralee Institute of Technology.  The group received a large amount of that money.  This shows how the mid west has the potential to bring added value because institutions in the area are used to co-operating and thinking regionally.  While I accept the content of the Bill, we must maintain the flexibility and innovation in the mid west generated by SFADCO.  I do not see the same level of innovation in any other region.  Perhaps I am biased because I represent the region.</P>

	<P>Shannon Development has set up the Plassey Enterprise Centre, giving indigenous companies the opportunity to develop and link with the University of Limerick.  There is room for considerable development around that area.  The riverbank could also be developed, a project in which Shannon Development has been involved.  I hope it continues to be a company that directs matters in the mid west.  The Minister of State should clarify what the Government expects the authority to do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">He should also be more specific in his reference to the company&rsquo;s strategic role on the broader regional economic development of the Shannon region.  Its role was quite specific in that area and its role is quite specific in other areas.  The worst case scenario is that the mid-west falls between <Col N="1414"/>two stools, with uncertainty about the roles of Shannon Development, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.</P>
        <P>I commend the staff at Shannon Development and support this Bill with the proviso that the Minister must ensure appropriate levels of resources for SFADCO to continue its work.</P>

	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan spoke of the innovative success of the Shannon region over the past decades.  I have often wondered what makes the Shannon region special.  Perhaps it was the O&rsquo;Malleys, the Noonans, the Kemmys, the O&rsquo;Deas or the O&rsquo;Sullivans who pulled one stroke after another to ensure preferable treatment for the region.  Perhaps there is a cuteness in the air in Kerry, Limerick and Clare that lends itself to an enterprising nature.  Whatever it is we should bottle it and spread it around the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, could do with it in the south east.  Statistics about wealth in this country suggest that the north west and the south east could do with the development achieved by Shannon Development in recent years.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we should examine this on a national basis to ensure each region is developed in a fair manner.  I do not know if this would mean a development body in every part of the country.  I welcome the intent of this Bill, to implement the recommendation of the enterprise strategy group.  Those working with the Shannon Development agency on enterprise development could join Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>Questions must be asked about the development of our enterprise and innovation strategy.  We have a successful economy but much of the economic growth and development comes from property development or foreign direct investment from overseas.  Exports from indigenous manufacturing and service companies are declining, despite the Celtic tiger economy.  There is concern that, under this Government, we have failed to develop real innovation and new enterprise success stories.  We have failed to increase our level of productivity in traded companies.  This requires a reappraisal of our enterprise strategy, including the roles of Forf&aacute;s, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  We must examine how these agencies develop technological, marketing and employment competence.</P>
        <P>A bureaucratic system may be left by the transfer of some staff to Enterprise Ireland.  The remaining entity, Shannon Development, may continue without recognising the change.  This may result in replication of bureaucracies.  A regional development agency linked to strong regional or local authority could examine strategic issues across county boundaries such as <Col N="1415"/>tourism development, enterprise development, services and infrastructure provision.  This could be replicated across the country.  We have a unique application of the principle at Shannon and we could knit such a regional development organisation into a reform of regional and local government.  There is no point in such bodies without strong development of local and regional government to ensure joined-up thinking.  Shannon Development should become the norm rather than the exception.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan that regional development requires a change of thinking in central government.  The transport policy has not been based on analysis, consultation or debate in the D&aacute;il.  A national roads programme was agreed on the principle that all roads lead to Dublin.  Ministers claim this is to facilitate regional development.  However, international research and analysis shows that such a centralised transport system around the capital sucks life into the capital and sucks the population towards the east coast.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Government&rsquo;s transport policy has been to oppose proper balanced regional development.  First, it set out a national spatial strategy that included too many centres.  It did not concentrate growth in real alternative city centres, such as Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Cork, that could provide the back-up facilities such as universities and other resources that would attract foreign direct investment.  In failing to so do, it weakened the entire case for regional development.</P>
        <P>The Government then went further in undermining the case for regional development by scattering the Civil Service throughout the country.  Some of the main cities on which we must concentrate development were ignored.  The fact that Cork city will not acquire a single agency or new job under the decentralisation programme demonstrates what a disgraceful mistake it has been on the Government&rsquo;s part.  It was dreamt up by Charlie McCreevy on the eve of budget day because he was bored or could not think of anything else to do after seven years in office.  It will leave a legacy that will harm regional development and the overall development of the Civil Service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Shannon region of Limerick, Clare and north Kerry has enormous assets that should be protected and developed.  For instance, the deep water port at Shannon is a great asset.  My party will seek to develop such assets in the best possible manner.  Shannon Airport is an asset that would be greatly enhanced by a proper rail connection.  When I worked as a tour operator in the region, if tourists arrived after lunchtime on any given day it was impossible to get them to Killarney by public transport before the next day.  It took more than 24 hours unless one shunted them to Dublin and back down again.  This lack of basic public transport infrastructure was <Col N="1416"/>remarkable in a country that was supposed to be trying to develop the region.</P>
        <P>The Green Party believes the Shannon region should be strengthened by the provision of additional rail services such as fast-tracking the western rail corridor and the rail links to Shannon.  Although Limerick city has four rail lines running into it, services on them barely exist.  This is a remarkable example of the poor short-term thinking applied by the Government.  While the region covered by Shannon Development should be developed, I am unsure whether responsibility for so doing lies primarily with Shannon Development.  It lies with local and national Government.  Hopefully the Green Party will have a say in that regard in future and will be able to help.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s point regarding balanced regional development.  I also echo the sentiment that if one were to pick an example of good industrial development on the entire western coastline, one would select Shannon.  However, it is important not to give the impression that all spending takes place on the east coast and none on the west coast.  One finds the highest pupil-teacher ratios, lowest proportion of garda&iacute; to population and similar pressure points on the east coast.  One should differentiate between capital expenditure and day to day expenditure on services.  It is important to note that a negative imbalance applies to the east coast in this regard because this has a bearing on quality of life.  Companies, particularly those from outside the country that are considering whether to set up here, often state that high quality public services are an issue of concern to them.</P>
        <P>As for the Bill before the House, I endorse the idea that the employees should be protected.  However, I wish to draw attention to another group of workers who were given a similar endorsement ten years ago, although it may not have been statutorily based.  The workers in question were obliged to go to the Supreme Court this year to press home their entitlements and still have not received them.  I refer to those Aer Lingus employees who were seconded to TEAM Aer Lingus.  I have the parliamentary debates from 1997 to hand.  The former Minister, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, was categoric in her statements to the effect that a letter of guarantee or comfort was a letter of employment and that people would continue to be employed by Aer Lingus.  I wish to focus on this issue because it matters that two sets of employees, both of which are State or semi-State employees, are being treated entirely differently.  This raises issues of fairness.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the Supreme Court found against Aer Lingus when it rejected the airline&rsquo;s contention that the Aer Lingus workers were transferred to TEAM Aer Lingus in 1991.  The Supreme Court found that the Aer Lingus workers in question were seconded to TEAM Aer Lingus and were Aer Lingus employees at all times.  The then <Col N="1417"/>Minister for Transport endorsed the letters of comfort given to Aer Lingus workers who were seconded to TEAM in 1990 to convert their guarantees concerning their position as Aer Lingus employees into an irrevocably legally binding form, such as if TEAM did not exist.  This is highly significant.  The contract was accepted by the Aer Lingus employees on the basis of such ministerial assurances and endorsements.  A comparison can be made in this regard.</P>
        <P>As for the Bill before the House, I again stress that I agree entirely that employees should be given guarantees that their pay, conditions, service and pension arrangements shall be in no way diminished by virtue of the proposed transfer.</P>
        <P>In respect of the aforementioned Supreme Court judgment, this matter has been brought back to the courts to press home the point for a small number of employees.  In a debate during the summer, Members from the Government benches from north Dublin stated they would be taken care of in the context of the sale of Aer Lingus.  However, they are back before the courts and such unfairness is dishonourable.  The Supreme Court found that the ministerial endorsement formed part of the heads of agreement reached between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Aer Lingus and is enforceable under Irish law.</P>
        <P>Essentially, much of the debate that took place in 1997, when Senator O&rsquo;Rourke was the Minister responsible, is similar to the debate in respect of the current Bill, in which guarantees are being given.  However, when one can cite an example such as that of the TEAM Aer Lingus employees, seeing such guarantees in legislation does not reassure people that it will actually happen.  The Government has an obligation to finalise this matter and not have such a situation, in which people have been extremely unfairly treated persist.  Both the High and Supreme Courts have endorsed their case and have dismissed the case put forward by Aer Lingus.  The courts found in favour of the employees.  The endorsements were provided by both Aer Lingus and Ministers.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to accept there is an outstanding issue to be addressed in this regard.  I raise this matter in the context of this Bill because of the degree of similarity between the proposals.  However, the proposals worked out very differently for the TEAM Aer Lingus employees who are still suffering its consequences.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be able to speak on the Industrial Development Bill.  I know it pertains to Shannon Development in particular and much of what I wish to say relates to the contributions of other Members regarding regional development.  This constitutes one of the good examples of regional development.  I agree there is a need to examine the regions to ensure their development potential is reached, strengthened <Col N="1418"/>and supported.  In accepting and acknowledging the work that has been done in the Shannon region, I also wish to relate this to my constituency.  The Shannon area is facing particular difficulties and changes which are probably due to the changes in the airport, which had a significant positive impact on the region.  Our area had a very good textile industry which had a very positive impact on the region.  In a time of change, it is important that the relevant State agencies are aware of the new potential in every region.  I am confident that every region has the potential to deliver significantly in terms of jobs.  </P>
        <P>Through education, Irish people are given a great opportunity to excel.  Across the world, Irish people are sought for many jobs, most of them high quality, and are recognised at the high end of the scale due to the investment in education in Ireland.  This emphasises the importance of not bringing everyone into a particular centre or hub, as has happened in the past.  Past development has tended to gravitate towards Dublin.  A previous speaker spoke about the lack of decentralisation to Cork.  With all due respect, the major centres have attracted a considerable amount of industry because they are accessible major centres with supporting infrastructure.  I agree with the decentralisation of Departments and Government support agencies to regions that do not possess the natural tendency to draw investment, as is perhaps the case in centres such as Dublin, Cork and, probably, Galway.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about identifying and bringing forward new initiatives, projects and programmes.  That is one of the points I will address.  The Minister also announced that he will examine the extensive property portfolio that Shannon Development will use.  In his speech, he pointed out that Shannon Development&rsquo;s property portfolio is located throughout the region.  That is a key point.  The Minister stated that Shannon Development would use its extensive property portfolio as a lever to drive the delivery of the economic development infrastructure that is essential for regional development.  I will address the last point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Donegal was considered almost as a test case for mass redundancy in the case of Fruit of the Loom.  I do not wish to focus exclusively on Fruit of the Loom because it also involved the overall textile industry as a number of companies found it uneconomical to remain in the region.  This was not the legacy we wanted to promote when thinking of industrial Donegal.  Fruit of the Loom received substantial investment and grant aid from the Government and many textile companies received support to locate in Donegal.  To be fair, these companies created a considerable amount of wealth in the Inishowen Peninsula, which I represent, and throughout my constituency.  This wealth trickled out throughout the entire north-west region.  In most of the cases involving redundancies, the companies concerned treated their staff very well, although that was not <Col N="1419"/>true in all cases.  However, Fruit of the Loom is long gone.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s comments about Shannon Development and recognising the importance of having extensive property portfolios are crucial to what I would argue for in my region.  One of the lessons of the Fruit of the Loom legacy relates to the disposal of assets.  Remnants of the Fruit of the Loom era, such as a number of factories, were dotted throughout north-east Donegal.  However, many people feel very sore, and rightly so, that those assets were not taken back, or should I say, bought back by State agencies.  I believe the company owned its own properties.  As the factories closed, the relevant State agency should have moved in and taken on the responsibility of adding these properties to its portfolio.  Many people believe these assets could have been used to attract other companies to the area and, just as importantly, they could have been adapted to provide enterprise space for local companies, either for business start-ups or business growth and expansion.  Ultimately, in some instances, the factories are empty or have been sold to businesses that did not create as many jobs.  I acknowledge that did not take place in all cases.  In other words, the number of people employed at any given time in any one of the factories has not been replicated at this time.</P>
        <P>We felt that if State agencies had property portfolios in the region, it would keep the pressure on them, but that has not always been the case.   An IDA Ireland advance factory has been located in my home town for approximately 30 years but has not really been used and has not opened its doors for any long-term venture.  I am aware that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland always worry about having property in their possession.  They would argue that if a property in their possession lies empty, it is merely a white elephant, but I would argue that it is very important for extensive property portfolios to be in place so that people who come to the region have the opportunity to look at various factories and move in straight away.  I regret that we do not have the significant property portfolio possessed by Shannon Development, as indicated by the Minister in his speech.  This factor has not helped when we brought people into the regions because we have not been able to point to potential opportunities for immediate start-ups.</P>
        <P>I have advocated and continue to advocate the need for industrial units, both in selling the area to prospective companies thinking about coming to the area and selling an enterprise culture to our home-grown companies to let them know that we have faith not only in their efforts but also in their ability to grow a sustainable and profitable company.  We certainly cannot make a mistake about it in the north west.  Home-grown companies are by no means looking for hand-outs and I am sure the same is true in the Shannon region. These companies have been quietly tip<Col N="1420"/>ping away sustaining local jobs for local people in a small but reliable way.  While I commend the work of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and county enterprise boards, many small companies, particularly indigenous companies, fall between two stools in terms of agency support.</P>
        <P>I noticed that the Minister said that Shannon Development works with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to identify and address indigenous and foreign direct investment companies in promoting the area.  It is very important that this co-operation is replicated in every region.  Situations arise where indigenous companies are falling between stools and are left ineligible for support.</P>
        <P>Given the rising prices of land and limited pockets of land zoned for industrial use, I strongly advocate the need to put in place supports to assist small businesses to purchase land to build premises at reasonable costs, rather than the over-inflated costs of land experienced around the Border areas due to the strength of sterling and the influx of developers from Northern Ireland who have more buying power for their pound.  In one instance, when I approached the local authority in respect of a consultation process it had carried out to dispose of land zoned for industrial use in a small town in my peninsula, I learned it was considering auctioning this land to the highest bigger.  In one way, one cannot tell the local authority it was wrong to do this because, as it would argue, it is not a development agency and must make money so it can provide services.  I vehemently argued against the idea of auctioning the land.  The county council in my area has been very proactive in trying not only to maintain jobs but also to support new industry and work alongside the county enterprise board, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.</P>
        <P>There is little or no industrial zoned land in the town in question, which is my home town.  This is because of the pressure to build more residential developments.  This effectively would exclude existing companies from expanding and reaching their full potential and, ultimately, prevent them from employing more people. I was informed by Donegal County Council that it was not a development agency, which I fully accept.  I am aware that Shannon Development will have a very strong link with Clare County Council.  The local authority has the same responsibility as anyone else to aid local economic development, particularly in respect of the disposal of land and premises.  The Government should be actively pursuing this area.  While on one hand, there is the disposal of large capital assets and the making of a profit, on the other, there is an argument for beginning to accrue land in small towns specifically for industrial and commercial development by local small businesses so that the potential for job creation measures exist even within regions.</P>
        <P>In regard to enterprise development space, we have listened in recent months to new and exciting plans for the north west.  I am glad these are <Col N="1421"/>being unveiled in regard to infrastructure and all-island co-operation through the interdepartmental group and the north-west gateway initiative.  I acknowledge the Minister has visited the north-west region on a number of occasions in this regard.</P>
        <P>In as much as we are seeking new exciting initiatives for the Shannon region, on an island basis this is probably one of the most opportune times for pilot initiatives and for an initiative that will be marked as historical.  This can be seen to be tied up in many respects to the current debate on whether the Executive will be re-assembled in March.  Ultimately, the success of our region relies on the peace process that commenced a number of years ago but which has still not realised its full potential.  We have seen the potential for road and other basic infrastructural investments in the north west.  I accept the Minister cannot do this single-handedly.</P>
        <P>Many of our problems are related to accessing the region.  The Minister is not responsible for a number of the counties in Ulster.  Therefore, the regional development and economic potential of our area rely heavily on the outcome of the current debate in the Six Counties of Ulster where hopefully the peace process will be cemented.  I call again for the people in charge of driving that process, the two main parties and their supporting other parties to stop prevaricating and realise that their people need the investment that is being offered by Gordon Brown and by the Government.  In that sense, our region needs them to, pardon my use of the phrase, get their finger out and face the reality of what they should be at, namely, local politics.</P>
        <P>In regard to the north-west gateway initiative, there is a real opportunity to harness and attract development into the north west.  A key area for this provision is enterprise units in Bridgend, Burnfoot or Muff.  This is a prime location in terms of three-way access between Letterkenny, Derry and Buncrana.  Our regional development must be simply that &mdash; spread throughout the north-west region.  Letterkenny is booming not least from a commercial perspective but it has also virtually burst at the seams.  It is good to see that.  We have a role in encouraging and pushing prosperity into other small towns, encouraging them to develop and grow.</P>
        <P>In regard to developing an enterprise culture, it is a case of which came first, the chicken or the egg.  To develop an enterprise culture, the infrastructure must be there and to develop the infrastructure, the enterprise demand must be there.  We must be proactive and take responsibility for creating an enterprise culture and driving it forward.  Developments such as the north-west gateway initiative and the work the Minister is doing in co-operation with the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the Sligo Institute of Technology and the colleges in the Derry area are important in this respect.</P><Col N="1422"/>
        <P>There is a need for higher standards of infrastructure in my county and elsewhere throughout the country.  Roads and water and sewerage schemes need to be progressed.  Energy provision and reliability of services must be guaranteed.  My area is one of the 10% to 15% of areas that still does not have rural broadband access.  Such access is needed as a priority in County Donegal, given that the county is being promoted as a work-life balance destination.  Given that Shannon Development also has a tourism dimension, the people there will understand when I talk about the need for the provision of basic infrastructure throughout the region to ensure that these opportunities are realised.</P>
        <P>Connectivity used to be the buzzword and some would say it will be a phrase of olden times by the time broadband is rolled out to Inishowen, but I do not believe so.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is progressing broadband access to the remaining 10% to 15% of areas that do not have it.  We are well on the way to being fully covered and connected.</P>
        <P>While we have done a considerable amount to raise living standards through the introduction of and increase in the minimum wage, we must be mindful that this adds to the burden of companies.  This aspect is as relevant in Shannon as it is elsewhere.  It is particularly more difficult for smaller companies to absorb those increased costs and the costs associated with PRSI contributions.  Many companies are struggling to make payments and cover wages on a weekly basis as their cash flow is being squeezed by slow payment by larger suppliers while their tax burden remains a weekly bill that must be paid.</P>
        <P>There are many pressures in my region in regard to the sustainability of companies, which must bridge the gap between receipt of payments due and the payment of moneys owed.  The decrease of our rates base following the closure of many large textile industries has put pressure on county councils to increase rates every year and the burden of that cost falls on the small number of companies in place, which is a vicious negative cycle.  The Minister might discuss with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the possibility of increasing the basic payment from that Department to the local authorities in recognition of the pressure they are under.  In towns such as Buncrana, approximately 48% of the rate base has been lost with the demise of the textile industry.  That puts untold pressure on the smaller industries that are trying to maintain themselves.  This probably also applies to other regions but it is particularly relevant to my region given the loss of textile industries there.</P>
        <P>In our recent history we have been known to offer tax breaks as incentives for various initiatives.  The tax breaks for the arts are important and should be targeted at the right people.  Sometimes it is argued they are not given to the people <Col N="1423"/>who need them most.  I would like to see the Government, particularly when we are seeking to maintain our competitiveness, take a more creative view of assisting small businesses in terms of tax and responsibilities as an employer.  Often an important employer, albeit on a small scale, particularly in rural communities can be the one that is under most pressure.</P>
        <P>I fully commend the work of the county enterprise boards.  They have introduced low interest loans and softer supports.  I also commend Enterprise Ireland on its work with specific sectors.  However, I would like to see more co-ordination in terms of supports for local industry, less movement of the goalposts and satisfying criteria and more practical assistance with tax and PRSI contributions.</P>
        <P>While I may stand to be corrected in this respect, I would like IDA Ireland to encourage more companies to locate in our region, as we have much to offer.  I would like the region to be better promoted and more companies to locate there such as AssetCo, PowerBar, PowerBoard which located there recently and the other small number of companies that are based there.</P>
        <P>In some respects some of the education issues are pertinent to my area rather than to Shannon Development.  We are pushing forward in government the debate on third and fourth level education.  It is important we continue to maintain an outturn of highly qualified potential employees and business people because employers elsewhere in the world are seeking to recruit Irish people as they recognise that they are well educated and their ability to perform internationally is high.  Therefore, we must ensure that we retain a number of these high-fliers in our regions.</P>
        <P>To that extent it is important to ensure that if people in areas such as County Donegal want to attend the university closest to them, namely, the universities in Derry, Coleraine and Belfast, they should be alleviated from the burden of the payment of cost of third level fees.   The cost there is &pound;3,000 per child per year, which places a heavy burden on people, particularly those who would qualify for a maintenance grant.  For example, if students were to qualify for a maintenance grant and a family has children in college, the payment of &pound;9,000 a year in college fees would be a substantial body-blow.  If a student applies for a loan for maintenance, he or she might be granted a loan for the cost of fees but I am informed that the student would not be granted a loan for the cost of maintenance.</P>
        <P>These issues are pertinent.  If we want to keep good people in our regions to attract other companies to build indigenous companies, we must be assured that the debate on third and fourth level education becomes a reality and that all people on this island get an opportunity in that respect.  We have relied on people migrating from other parts of the world to fill the gaps in employment terms.  It is important that we always focus <Col N="1424"/>on our indigenous people and ensure they have the opportunities here rather than having to go abroad while other people migrate here to fill the gaps in employment.  I hope the Bill will be of benefit to the south-west region and I look forward to a continuation of expansion of employment in the north-west region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The Minister outlined the purpose of the Bill, which is in accordance with the new mandate for Shannon Development announced by him in July 2005.  The indigenous industry functions carried out by Shannon Development under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland will revert to Enterprise Ireland on 1 January 2007.  I commented on this decision when it was first announced by the Minister.  Shannon Development is the most successful regional agency in this country and was the only integrated regional development agency.</P>
        <P>We examined regionalisation when it was the buzzword in the 1980s and early 1990s.  At that time, Shannon Development was held up as an example of how a regional agency should be structured and managed.  Its role was deemed to be the proper role for a development company.  As the Minister stated, &ldquo;For more than four decades, initiatives developed and delivered by the company have been adopted and reproduced successfully in Ireland and internationally.&rdquo;  Why break up something so successful?  I am all for change and I realise we must adapt our strategies and structures to measure up to the competition and be more efficient.  However, is it the right decision in this instance?  I question the motivation for the decision and will ask questions on the real motivation behind the dismantling of Shannon Development.</P>
        <P>The Shannon region, particularly the Ennis-Shannon-Limerick axis, is one of the most dynamic parts of the country.  Before the present boom was experienced in Dublin, the Shannon region was always held up as a shining example.  Despite what happened in the rest of the country, it was always successful even during the bad times of the 1980s.  Because of the airport and the University of Limerick, Shannon Development attracted some of the first electronic, technology and pharmaceutical industries into the region.</P>
        <P>Although some people would state otherwise, I always regarded Shannon Development as an extremely dynamic instrument for development in the area.  Without its presence, I doubt the greater Shannon region would be as vibrant as it is today.    The executive and the board of Shannon Development will do what the Minister tells them.  However genuine concern exists within the organisation about its reduced role.</P>
        <P>In the late 1980s, I promoted the idea of Shannon Development taking over responsibility for north Kerry, where it made a major impact.  It created Kerry Technology Park in Tralee, which is on the same site as the institute of tech<Col N="1425"/>nology.  The successful synergy operating between the college and the technology park spawned some of the country&rsquo;s top entrepreneurs.</P>
        <P>Recently, Jerry Kennelly developed a product, Stockbyte, which he sold on for approximately &euro;130 million.  At the Entrepreneur of the Year competition, Alan Scroope was recognised as one of the top young entrepreneurs.  The park has several success stories and would not be there without Shannon Development.</P>
        <P>In Listowel, Shannon Development created a business park where most of the units are now occupied.  The money for this came from the rental of its own property portfolio.  It was not Government money although I see Ministers coming to Kerry and claiming responsibility.</P>
        <P>Because of the break up of Aer Rianta, a Shannon airport authority will be created.  As a subsidy from Aer Rianta will no longer be received, from where will it receive funding?  I fear revenue from the property portfolio of Shannon Development will be directly invested in the airport authority.  That is not good economics.  Will the Minister clarify the matter?  How will the revenue which was used to regenerate industry and provide technology parks and business centres now be used?  Will Shannon Development still have the use of that money or will it go to the airport authority?</P>
        <P>Shannon Development is extremely creative and through its initiative created the e-town concept whereby it designated a number of e-towns in the region, one being Tarbert, County Kerry.   Tarbert is a small community which will be affected by the closure of Tarbert power station with the loss of 129 jobs.<b>  </b>I hope Shannon Development will continue to support the e-town initiative and that it will mean the provision of broadband connection and other facilities in Tarbert which will create alternative jobs when the power station closes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Until last year, Shannon Development had responsibility for tourism promotion in north Kerry, but the Government decided to remove that responsibility from Shannon Development.  However, while the decision was made, the structures for transition were not put in place.  Despite the extremely good people appointed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to administer tourism in north Kerry, I am convinced we lost out.  The fact there was some turmoil within the Cork-Kerry tourism authority did not help either.  The presence of Shannon Development and its hard-working offices provided a major boost to tourism in north Kerry.  It was only when the remit was taken from Shannon Development that people realised how effective it had been locally.  That is an aside, however, which does not concern this Bill.  It is all part of the dismantling of Shannon Development, which was a dynamic regional authority that was held up as an example to authorities not only in this country but all over the world.  I hope it is being dismantled for the right reasons, but time will tell.  I hope this development, for which we <Col N="1426"/>are providing a legislative basis, has been well thought through and will not diminish in any way the dynamic that was created within the region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Shannon Development has also been involved in the Shannon LNG project to import natural gas to the Shannon Development landbank in Kerry.  Shannon Development held on to this landbank of 600 acres between Tarbert and Ballylongford.  Some time ago, there was a proposal to sell this land but the company held on to it and took it over from IDA Ireland.  It has now succeeded in getting this important project not only for north Kerry and specifically the Tarbert-Ballylongford area, but also for the country at large.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Natural gas is imported mostly from the UK and is becoming the global fuel of choice for electricity generation and other industrial energy consumption.  This project on the Shannon Estuary, which has been driven by Shannon Development, will be very important for the region.  I wonder, however, what Shannon Development&rsquo;s future role will be in attracting industries, such as the LNG project, into the Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank.  I understand Shannon Development has attracted another interested party, which has connections to similar projects in Europe, with a view to doing another project.  All of that has arisen because of Shannon Development&rsquo;s marketing expertise, presentation, experience and the confidence the organisation has developed over the years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The north Kerry area has lost many of its traditional engineering companies.  From Tralee to Tarbert we have probably lost approximately ten to 15 such firms over the past ten years.  These companies employed from 50 to over 200 workers but they are now all gone.  We have had little or no foreign direct investment in the area in that period.  IDA Ireland has brought five itineraries to the area in the past five years.  We have had to depend totally on Shannon Development to provide important jobs such as those in the technology park in Tralee.  Hopefully, new jobs can also be created at the landbank.  During its construction stage, this project will bring in about 400 people and about 50 permanent staff later.  The proposed project is close to the Tarbert power station, which employs 129 people but is due to close shortly.  Under the new arrangement, I hope the dynamic created by Shannon Development in the region will continue.</P>
        <P>North Kerry and west Clare must be the most peripheral and marginalised region in the country.  There is a national secondary road servicing north Kerry, which runs through west Limerick, the port of Foynes, into Tarbert and via Listowel on to Tralee.  Very little funding is going into national secondary roads.  Kerry accounts for 13% of all national secondary roads in the country.  The National Roads Authority is concentrating its funding on national primary roads but north Kerry does not have such a road so the area <Col N="1427"/>is disadvantaged, marginalised and suffering as a result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In any new overview of the region, I hope the N69, which is our national secondary road, will be prioritised for funding.  The road services one of the busiest ports in the country at Foynes.  Now that it will also service the new development on the landbank, which hopefully will take place, the road should be earmarked for major investment.  I agree with connecting the main cities with a state-of-the-art primary road network and, as someone who drives regularly from Kerry to Dublin, I value the major developments along that route.  Funding must continue for the national primary road network if we are to have a proper spatial strategy.  If we are to achieve balanced regional development, however, we cannot allow places like north Kerry and west Clare to fall behind just because they are not on the national primary road network.  In view of the new brief the Minister has given to Enterprise Ireland for the region, and the fact Shannon Development will have a different type of brief, I urge the Minister to ensure the road network and other infrastructure, including broadband, will be part of the new brief.</P>
        <P>In his speech, the Minister said Shannon Development will address the needs of less developed parts of the region.  If my interpretation of that new role is correct, there will be an important role for Shannon Development in pulling together all the strands concerning underdeveloped areas such as north Kerry.  The Minister should designate north Kerry and west Clare for pilot projects under the new arrangements.  It should be possible to do so.  The Minister should provide that reassurance to people in that region in which case they would be less concerned about the future role of Shannon Development there.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of making a few points on the record concerning Shannon Development.  It represents a success story going back to the great Mr. Brendan O&rsquo;Regan.  The organisation has done so much for industry and tourism, in addition to establishing the University of Limerick.  It also developed the free zone around Shannon Airport, which was unique at that time.  That model has been used since then, not only here but also in other parts of the world to attract industry.  Its role in attracting industry to the region at an early stage should be acknowledged.  Hopefully this will not be diminished</P>
        <P>The Minister occasionally appears in Kerry when he has a positive announcement to make.  One of his party colleagues recently announced a new call centre for Tralee and he has been invited by the chamber of commerce there to visit some time in January.  I call on him to designate the Tarbert-Ballylongford land bank as an energy park and give Shannon Development, in its new role, responsibility for developing that property.</P><Col N="1428"/>
        <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak on this Bill as it is very important for the area and will hopefully lead to better things for the region.  I hope the Minister will address the points I have raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill gives me an opportunity to raise some issues relating to the area I represent, particularly recent Glanbia decisions and the Green Isle food plant in Boyle.  Glanbia, despite being a public company has totally abdicated its responsibilities with regard to the plant it took over from the Hanley family in Rooskey some years ago.  Once the fire took place there and the decision was made not to rebuild it, Glanbia decided to take the proceeds of its insurance claim, to which it was entitled, and use them in its operations elsewhere in the country.  </P>
        <P>The final straw for the people in the area came this week when the cannery which had operated since the fire, and provided 85 jobs, was closed.  We should examine the options that were open to Glanbia.  It is a public company that operates in the agri-sector which means it should have some responsibility to people in rural Ireland.  In the case of Rooskey, Glanbia had the opportunity to support a management buy-out that would have continued to run the plant as a going concern.  The board decided it would not support this option and I would appreciate if it would give the details concerning how this decision was reached.  The management buy-out was critical to the development of the business and I believe Glanbia has been trying to run down the business for the past 12 to 18 months.  Questions must be answered as to why the buy-out was not supported and jobs saved.</P>
        <P>In the wake of the fire at the Glanbia plant Rooskey saw the loss of 500 jobs leaving only 85 in the cannery.  I feel the State agencies would have supported the management buy-out to develop the business but it is obvious Glanbia decided selling the property would be preferable to maintaining the business.  I feel this is wrong because the project would have had a future if the buy-out, which was supported by a Dutch company, had received Glanbia&rsquo;s support.  I suggest Glanbia make the site available to Enterprise Ireland to seek an alternative industry serving the people in the area.  If it does not do so Glanbia must explain why it will not consider the management buy-out.  I believe the option is still there and, if taken, could save 85 jobs.</P>
        <P>Some might say 85 jobs is not a significant number.  However, 85 jobs in Roscommon, Leitrim or anywhere in rural Ireland is probably equal to between 400 and 500 in one of our major cities.  The effect of the loss of these jobs on the local economy is frightening and we have seen the effect of the fire which saw the loss of over 400 jobs.  It is easy to say redundancy will be paid and other opportunities will arise but we are talking about people with skills relating to the meat <Col N="1429"/>industry, such as boners.  Such skills may not be easily redeployed as new opportunities arise.</P>
        <P>Boyle saw a similar situation recently when the Green Isle plant closed with the loss of 80 jobs.  Despite the best efforts of all involved, nothing has been done regarding the provision of alternative employment.  Enterprise Ireland, in conjunction with Roscommon County Council, the local chamber of commerce and other voluntary bodies in the town, is seeking an alternative industry for the area.</P>
        <P>Both cases concern projects that received substantial State aid and it may be necessary to examine the period a company must remain in a region to qualify for such support.  If a company decides to relocate, the State should recoup a larger amount than it currently does in such circumstances.  If something is not done on this issue the agri-based industry in the country will suffer.  The co-ops were producer friendly but the public limited companies, PLCs, in question nowadays are anti-producer and every reduction in price comes at the expense of the primary producer.  The farming organisations and interest groups must remain vigilant to ensure primary producers receive a reasonable price.</P>
        <P>The arrival of the PLCs has not been in the best interests of producers because they are driven solely by the profits they create for shareholders.  I accept rationalisation must take place in certain industries but not with primary producers and workers bearing the brunt of cuts because they have always been the first to lose out as PLCs focus on the bottom line.</P>
        <P>There is a need for balanced development.  Major developments are taking place in cities and many areas of rural Ireland are finding their lifeblood drawn there.  Some rural communities are suffering due to a lack of employment opportunities, particularly for graduates.  Our rate of third level education is extremely high and we produce a large number of graduates every year who rarely return to the community from which they came.  Graduates tend to join companies based in our large cities and towns.  Enterprise Ireland and the Industrial Development Agency should seek projects, perhaps small ones in some cases, that can grow in rural areas.  Most areas now have broadband and the necessary developments which allow businesses operate.  Our infrastructure has improved a great deal and I can now safely drive from Dublin to Carrick-on-Shannon in less than two hours due to the new N4 road which bypasses several towns.  In that context, there is no reason this region should not be considered as attractive to major industrialists deciding to locate here as our major cities.  The area also has the advantage of being less than one hour from Sligo and Knock airports.  Enterprise Ireland and the Industrial Development Agency are not pushing companies to locate in areas which are regarded as peripheral because they are more than one hour from an international airport.  In the case of south Leitrim, however, <Col N="1430"/>Knock International Airport can be reached in only 50 minutes.  Enterprise Ireland and the IDA must ensure they achieve regional balance in terms of the location of new jobs.</P>
        <P>While we all accept the market for attracting inward investment has become much more competitive, Ireland still has considerable advantages over other countries as regards industrial development.  Corporation tax rates are the lowest in Europe, the wage system is attractive and the personal tax system is the envy of many other countries.  We should be able to encourage inward investors to locate in areas some distance from Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway.</P>
        <P>In levelling criticism it is also important to applaud success.  My constituency has successfully attracted a number of major companies.  Masonite, for example, established operations near Carrick-on-Shannon in the mid-1990s.  This was the first large investment in the area by a non-indigenous company in my lifetime.  It has made a major contribution to the economy and workforce and should be complimented on the way in which it runs its business and on successfully expanding its operations.</P>
        <P>In the past ten years, productivity has significantly increased.  The recent Forf&aacute;s report entitled, Overview of Ireland&rsquo;s Productivity Performance 1980-2005, would make good reading for many people.  The report stresses the need to improve productivity and notes that Ireland has enjoyed substantial economic growth since 1990.  It states that whereas growth in other OECD economies over the same period was driven more by increases in productivity than employment, Ireland&rsquo;s growth has been built on gains in both areas.  Productivity increases, it argues, must be the key driver of future growth.</P>
        <P>Upskilling will be required to deliver increases in productivity and incentives must be introduced to ensure people receive the necessary training to upgrade their skills on a continual basis.  While the economy continues to achieve significant annual rates of growth, much of our employment continues to depend on the manufacturing sector, which is finding it increasingly difficult to compete with companies from eastern Europe and the Far East.  For this reason, Enterprise Ireland and other State agencies must provide funding for upskilling.  F&Aacute;S has done much good work in upskilling people but this issue must be examined in the context of future economic development.</P>
        <P>The most significant recent industrial development in south Leitrim and north Roscommon was the decision by MBNA to locate in Carrick-on-Shannon.  Recently acquired by the Bank of America, this credit card company employs approximately 1,100 people in a town with a population of approximately 4,500 people.  It is, therefore, a major employer in Carrick-on-Shannon and the surrounding district.  We must support efficient companies such as MBNA because they provide employment for our highly skilled young people.  I appeal to Enterprise <Col N="1431"/>Ireland and the IDA to try to attract other companies offering similar employment to locate in the area.  The region has the advantage of third level IT colleges in Sligo and Athlone and a number of smaller third level colleges elsewhere, all of which produce highly skilled graduates suited to this type of employment.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested that MBNA plans to move into the insurance business.  I appeal to the company to consider establishing its base in my region.  Its experience in the area has been good and local people have been supportive of its efforts.</P>
        <P>In discussing industrial development, we overlook another major sector, namely, tourism.  It is argued that tourism is the main prospect for certain rural areas.  Tourism Ireland, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, and others have done their utmost to support tourism programmes and promote projects.  For example, the tax incentives available for the provision of hotel accommodation were welcome and made a significant contribution.  In my constituency, however, tourism projects are facing a new problem.  In Boyle alone, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused permission for four or five major tourism projects for minor reasons, including, in one case, the presence of bats.  The proposed &euro;250 million investment in question would have created major opportunities for Boyle and the Lough Key area.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decisions send out the wrong signal to those who want to invest in tourism.  They will result in additional investment in areas that are already over-subscribed in terms of tourist numbers and in which planning is not an issue.  Tourism projects that would make a major contribution should be fully supported by all State agencies.  As we are all aware, one individual can overturn the best laid plans for developing projects.</P>
        <P>The problem of objectors also applies to industrial development.  The not in my back yard &mdash; NIMBY &mdash; attitude has played a major part in many proposals for industrial development.  The consultation process must be weighted against opponents of developments because we cannot afford to allow international or national companies seeking to expand their operations to be held to ransom by objectors using the planning process.  In recent years, a number of major projects have been delayed by objections lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the national courts and the European Court of Justice.  The most prominent of these was probably the repeated delays to the M3 motorway project.  While the objectors finally raised the white flag, they did so only after they had added significant costs to the project.  Delaying the construction of an infrastructure project by three years will probably double its cost.  It is unfair that people can lodge objections and hold up progress without being required to make a contribution towards the cost of the delay they cause.  This tactic has been used to delay other <Col N="1432"/>projects and prevent the development of infrastructure which will give opportunities to peripheral areas to develop and become attractive for industry.  The Minister has taken an initiative in Glanbia in Rooskey but we still face the serious situation where many agri-based projects find the processing industry is controlled by PLCs, which is having an adverse effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We support the Minister&rsquo;s efforts in this Bill but the Departments, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland must look at the regional areas that have suffered most due to population decline and a lack of industrial development.  They must seek out projects to replace those indigenous projects that are vulnerable in the global economy today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate but, like the previous two speakers, I will not dwell on the Bill.  Shannon Development has a proud record and I wish it well in its change over to Forf&aacute;s.  It created jobs in a difficult areas.</P>
        <P>Many years ago the previous Minister visited us in the Lough Egish area.  We were seeking a similar tax regime to the Shannon or Cork areas to develop industry.  The proposed closure of the Lakeland Dairies milk powder plant in the summer of next year brings the issue of the Lough Egish development park back into focus.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Through no direct fault of the Minister or IDA Ireland, Cavan and Monaghan have not made much progress.  The situation in Northern Ireland and the lack of infrastructure have caused many difficulties.  Thankfully, infrastructure is improving and the Northern situation, which has improved dramatically, should be finalised within the next few months.  There will be no further excuses then for those involved in inward or national investment from seeing Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal as areas for industrial provision.</P>
<?oasys _dc14- ?>
        <P>All parties visited the milk powder plant in Lough Egish.  There was still some hope at that stage that four of the co-operatives in the north east might come together to establish a cheese factory using the plant&rsquo;s premises.  We got the good news that the Minister for Agriculture and Food had provided grant aid of &euro;100 million for such projects.  Unfortunately, within weeks of that announcement, the situation was changed and a ceiling of &euro;12.5 million grant aid or &euro;25 million investment was laid down.  As anyone involved in the sector knows, that would kill off the idea of a cheese factory.  I hope there may be a way around it because there are cold stores and drying plants that could be used for whey and other products, minimising overall costs.  It is hard to understand why such changes happen in middle of the process.</P>
<?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>I pay tribute to the Molloy and Sherry families who owned the premises next door to Lakeland Dairies in this rural area.  They own a cold store and a number of factories and have undertaken a major investment programme that was visited by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and <Col N="1433"/>Employment, Deputy Harney.  We never heard a reply, however, to our request for a tax benefit.  It was unfortunate that Mr. Sherry felt he had to sell out because of the lack of support he got for the number of units he provided.</P>
        <P>It has since been taken over by another industrialist, Mr. Paul Shortt, and I hope the Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Food will ensure the necessary help is given to this establishment to allow for full use of the existing buildings and the erection of new buildings.  This man has provided employment in the Castleblayney area, working with Heinz in Dundalk and the Kerry Group in Carrickmacross to bring in raw material and export the final product.  He would offer a great service to any industry that set up in Lough Egish.  He is an Irishman and should enjoy the same support as any foreigner who comes in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The closure of CPV in Clones was a blight on the area.  The then Minister&rsquo;s main interest was in getting back the few hundred thousand euro in grants she claimed was owed to IDA Ireland, instead of encouraging someone else to take over the factory.  It has been bought by a number of different groups but little progress has been made in replacing the 150 jobs in this depressed area.  More interest in the area should be shown by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ellis mentioned the co-operatives that had become PLCs.  There is doubt this has had a major impact.  The difficulties in Lakeland Dairies, although it is not a PLC, are more related to the banks than to farmers, which makes me worried for the future.  It is strange to see that water, which costs a nominal amount to bottle, is more expensive than milk.  My farm produces liquid milk and it is scandalous that this high quality product which has served the country so well has been failed by the co-operatives, particularly the PLCs.  They deserve a great deal of criticism for the way they have failed to sell it compared with companies like Coca Cola.  There is a factory on the border between Cavan and Monaghan.  I gave a graph it provided to us to the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i>, and it is published on the second page of this week&rsquo;s edition.  It clearly shows we are no longer competitive with regard to power.  It is difficult to understand that in a world economy, the price of electricity for 2007 will be &euro;1.10 per kilowatt hour in Ireland.  The price is 62 cent per kilowatt hour in the Netherlands, where this company has another factory, and a factory belonging to the company in France pays 55 cent per kilowatt hour.  In other words, France is half the price of Ireland for power in 2007.</P>
        <P>There are 300 jobs at risk in the Wellman plant in Mullagh, County Cavan, on the border between Cavan and Meath.  There is a cost to that plant of electricity alone, compared with France.  We are not talking about China or the Far East, but another EU country.  The cost is a 50% difference, 55 cent per kilowatt hour in one and &euro;1.10 for the same unit in the other.  Some &euro;2 million is the charge to Wellman for that alone.</P><Col N="1434"/>
        <P>Returning to the situation in Cavan-Monaghan, where the Minister has been in the not too distant past, I advise that we are at last getting the infrastructure there right.  I pay tribute to everybody concerned.  It was one of the issues I stated clearly would be a priority when I entered this Chamber 14 years ago.  I congratulate everybody who has brought us this far.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Acting Chairman, Deputy McGinley, may not be here long enough to see the full benefit of the Castleblaney bypass, as he is retiring, but it will leave us within an hour from Dublin at Carrickmacross and within two hours from Dublin in Monaghan town.  The road will bring the trip down to approximately an hour and 45 minutes.  Infrastructure is no longer an issue.  We are within that journey time from the airports.  By 22 December, we will be closer to Dublin Port, and we have access to Larne and others already.</P>
        <P>I beg the Minister to spread the message, especially to those interested in setting up here, that we have the availability of land.  We have some advance factories built by the private sector, and we have personnel and staff who would be willing to come back to live in Cavan or Monaghan if they got the opportunity.  Thankfully, we are getting a small level of decentralisation in Monaghan, and I hope it will be a greater level in Cavan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need high-tech jobs.  For whatever reason, most of our young people seek third level education.  The opportunities for these people to return and work in Cavan and Monaghan are not as they should be.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor reminded me several times that we have one of the higher levels of immigrant workers in Monaghan.  That is because we are in the food and furniture industries, for example, which deal with manufacturing jobs.  That is not acceptable, and we need real help from IDA Ireland.</P>
        <P>The only outside jobs created in Monaghan in recent years came through Associated Packaging, outside Carrickmacross.  I was directly involved in the process.  That company did not take any capital grants from IDA.  The buildings were constructed for them by a private entrepreneur, being changed from another business.  That is the only major group to come in.</P>
        <P>I am told by Deputy Deenihan that the Minister visits Kerry and such places.  We would welcome the Minister to Monaghan and I guarantee him a safe journey.</P>

	<P>I apologise, the Minister was there.  Again, that was a private individual who started off in a farmyard many years ago.  Today, a planner would tell anybody trying to start off in <Col N="1435"/>a farmyard that it is not allowed.  That shows how negative our personnel are.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is speaking about county councils now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one case where the enterprise board gave a grant towards setting up a small company in a farmyard, yet the council is telling the person in question he will not get the planning permission to change from agricultural to industrial use.  That shows how negative and out of touch some of these people are.  The Quinn Group in Cavan is another example of a local person giving tremendous employment through his group&rsquo;s insurance and other operations.</P>
        <P>I have major anxieties over the farming and pig industries.  Unless we can act to safeguard those from the nitrates directive, we could lose more jobs in Cavan-Monaghan.  Tourism and conference centres are doing well in spite of the Troubles.</P>
        <P>There is a commitment from the UK Government towards the peace process in Northern Ireland in real financial terms.  I wish to ensure our Government has the same proud record as it had at the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Money was made available through IFI and EU funding.  Thankfully, our Government now has sufficient funds for this as a result of the Celtic tiger etc.</P>
        <P>Money must be invested not just in the Six Counties, but in at least some of the six Border counties.  Sligo and Louth have received fairly major investment in one way or another, such as through colleges, industry etc.  The likes of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal have not.  I urge the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the Government as a whole, to ensure they use the next few weeks and months to make a major commitment to re-stabilising that area, which suffered so much over the past 35 years.  It suffered in many ways over which we had no control.</P>
        <P>There is goodwill and opportunity there.  The UK Government has already made a commitment of sorts.  I urge our Government to do the same.  We on this side of the House will give the Government any support required to get that package through.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this piece of legislation, the Industrial Development Bill 2006.  I wish to share time with Deputy Nolan, whom I expect in the Chamber shortly.</P>
        <P>This is a short piece of legislation dealing specifically with the new mandate recommended by the enterprise strategy group for Shannon Development.  It indicated the indigenous industry support functions carried out by Shannon Development under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland will revert to Enterprise <Col N="1436"/>Ireland on 1 January 2007.  The reversion of these functions will also involve the transfer of approximately 40 staff from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide a legislative framework designed to facilitate the transfer of the individual staff members concerned and provide a statutory guarantee to staff, where so designated, that the pay and service conditions, as well as pension arrangements, will not be diminished by virtue of the transfer.  That is very important to staff.</P>
        <P>It is important to state that there have been a number of recent developments which have necessitated some of these changes.  There has been the establishment of the independent Shannon Airport Authority, an important step which gives a real mandate to the people in the mid west to develop international air transport to an extent not possible before.  In the past year, I noted that people from the midlands have gone to Shannon when they wanted to fly to the United States or even Europe and the United Kingdom as it is much easier to get to Shannon from the midlands region than to go through the traffic jam that is involved in getting to Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>The proposed relocation of the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland to Shannon as part of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the transfer of responsibility for Shannon town from Shannon Development to Clare County Council and the abolition of the licensing requirement for companies setting up in the Shannon free zone form the background for this legislation.</P>
        <P>This Second Stage debate provides me with an excellent opportunity to speak on the subject of industrial development and to refer to matters that flow from this legislation.  This Bill will affect the Offaly part of my constituency of Laoighis-Offaly which used to be under the aegis of Shannon Development, even though it is a little removed from the area.  The number of employees of foreign-owned multinational companies is at approximately 200,000 people out of a workforce of approximately 2 million, amounting to 9% or 10% of the total workforce.  This is a vital form of employment provided by companies with an international perspective which help Ireland&rsquo;s promotion on the international stage.  Ireland has been very successful in attracting foreign investment due to the good work of agencies such as IDA Ireland, the Minister and the Department.</P>
        <P>The statistics show that Irish people will invest more funds abroad than foreign companies are investing in Ireland.  This is attributed to the fact that Ireland is a mature economy.  For many years Ireland was the beneficiary of money from the European Union but now that we have made a good fist of managing our own resources we are strong enough to be less dependent on people coming to help us out.  Ireland&rsquo;s open market <Col N="1437"/>economy attracts foreign investment but there is an equal number of Irish people investing abroad.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Fine Gael Whip for calling a quorum and bringing the Taoiseach into the House to hear my important intervention on behalf of County Laois and industrial development in the midlands.  I am very pleased with the audience and I know the point is well taken.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has a particularly good track record in County Laois.  It has been responsible for Irish companies increasing employment in Portlaoise and in the county.  I also note the good track record in this regard of the county enterprise board.</P>
        <P>Modern industrial development is no longer to be associated with physical development and jobs in industry.  I regard jobs in the tourism industry as industrial jobs because tourism is one of our major industries and remarkable development has taken place in that sector in County Laois.  Seven new hotels have been built in County Laois in the past seven years, six of which are brand new buildings while one of them replaces an existing hotel.  The situation has changed from a single hotel in Portlaoise to having three major hotels in the town and seven new hotels in the county.  IDA Ireland would always have stressed the importance of having such facilities when industrialists are coming to a region to visit the IDA Ireland park such as that in Portlaoise.  It is a top class facility on a 47-acre site which is very close to the centre of the town.  It is landscaped and finished to a high standard.  It contains a fine office block which, hopefully will soon be occupied by an Enterprise Ireland or IDA client.  If that is not possible, perhaps another suitable business could be allowed to use the facility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another industry also operates on the site and recently the Minister and IDA Ireland agreed that part of the 47 acres will be used for the decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  There will be much activity on the site in the coming years.  An office block to house 800 people in the Department of Agriculture and Food will be a major development for that part of town.  I hope it attracts other developments into this first class IDA Ireland site.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have other sites in Portlaoise for development, such at the Togher interchange near the motorway.  If heavy industry is not to use such sites, I would like to see financial services companies coming to County Laois.  Quinn Insurance recently announced a large new operation in Navan and the VHI is operating successfully from Kilkenny, as are other banking and financial organisations.  Laois is as equally well-placed as those counties for such employment.  We have the motorway and a first class train facility.  There is plenty of scope for IDA Ireland to bring industry into the county.</P><Col N="1438"/>
        <P Just="Left">We are working on improving third level education in the county.  Many Laois people currently attend Carlow Institute of Technology.  We are examining the possibility of opening a campus attached to that institute in Portlaoise.  Should it go ahead, it would be called the midlands, or south-east, institute of technology.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>I firmly believe that the midlands region needs an airport.  Traffic to and from Dublin Airport can only be described as horrific.  On the radio yesterday, someone said it had taken him five hours to fly to Dublin from Boston, but two and a quarter hours to get from the airport to Ballsbridge.  That is off putting.  It would be welcome if, in conjunction with its military facilities, Baldonnel could be used as a commercial airport.  The entire midlands could be served by such an airport.  Dublin Airport has major development plans, but the number of passengers is increasing enormously.  People in the midlands are now travelling to Shannon Airport where there is greater ease in accessing the terminal building and the car park; one need not worry about negotiating the M50.  One can predict the journey time to Shannon Airport with much greater accuracy.  I accept that any new airport would have to be funded by private investment, but I do not have an issue with this prospect.  I would like to see such investment attracted to Baldonnel on the south side of Dublin.  It would be within 40 or 50 minutes of much of the midland region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I encourage IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise boards to continue their work in Laois.  We would like to see greater activity from IDA Ireland in the county than we have had recently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I understand the Bill is designed to facilitate the transfer of functions and to guarantee staff rights from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland.  This debate provides Members of the House with the opportunity to outline the concerns and difficulties they may be experiencing in their counties regarding employment and the sourcing of direct investment by IDA Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, but particularly in County Carlow, are hugely disappointed with the efforts IDA Ireland has made to place foreign direct investment in Carlow.  I recently saw a report that showed the number of IDA Ireland-created jobs in Carlow to be minuscule.  I have discussed this with the Minister in the past.  Ireland&rsquo;s economy has performed strongly in recent years and the type of jobs we are attracting has changed.  The town and county of Carlow has provided prospects for potential employers.  We have a third level institute that is willing to accommodate potential employers with suitable courses.  We have outlined this to potential employers, but for some reason there seems to be a lack of interest or commitment from IDA Ireland to pinpoint Carlow as an area for investment.</P><Col N="1439"/>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P Just="Left">County Carlow has reinvented itself to attract this type of business.  I commend Enterprise Ireland and Carlow&rsquo;s indigenous entrepreneurs who have been singularly successful in creating well paid, highly skilled jobs in the county.  It helps ensure that people who were born and educated in Carlow can continue to live and work there.  There have been many contributors to the transformation, but the presence of a third level institute in Carlow has been a major factor in ensuring the local people who have a record of creating jobs have done so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, we can only do so much ourselves.  We need the assistance and commitment of State enterprises such as IDA Ireland.  I regret to say that this has not been forthcoming to date.  Carlow is sited in an important and pivotal location.  Indeed, the Minister&rsquo;s Department is relocating 320 jobs there.  We hope to see an advance group of up to 90 civil servants moving to Carlow in the coming months.  The county has everything a family or individual needs.  Yet, for some inexplicable reason, the IDA is either not prepared, not committed, or does not want to see Carlow as a gateway for job creation.  It is unfair on Carlow people who can see the number of jobs being created in other large urban centres.</P>
        <P>The strategy in recent years has been to avoid congestion in cities such as Dublin, Cork and even Waterford.  To pick up on Deputy Fleming&rsquo;s point, we need a regional airport in the south east.  While there is an airport in Waterford, regrettably, it is on the wrong side of the city.  People are not prepared to use it because they have to traverse the city and with bridge openings and congestion that can take as long as it would take to travel from Carlow or Kilkenny to Dublin Airport &mdash; that is time consuming too.</P>
        <P>Only two weeks ago, we met with a potential investor in Carlow.  One of his main concerns was that many of his staff would be coming from overseas and there would be significant interaction between overseas branches and the proposed Irish operation.  One of the downsides he identified with locating in the south east was that it would take so long to get there from Dublin Airport.  There is a strong case to be made for locating a new airport in the south east, perhaps somewhere on the Kilkenny-Carlow-Portlaoise axis.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I again highlight the need to get a commitment from the IDA to invest in Carlow, which has suffered significant job losses in recent years with the closure of Irish Sugar and a significant employer in the laundry business.  We have had the downsizing of international companies Braun and, more recently, Lapple.  It is incumbent on the agency responsible for bringing foreign direct investment into the country not to forget small counties such as Carlow, which have a tradition of enterprise and which will not let the side down when it comes to giving 100% on employment.  We have <Col N="1440"/>a skilled workforce and everything a foreign company locating in this country needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for this opportunity to speak to the Industrial Development Bill 2006.  I welcome the debate.  It is important we have an informed debate on industrial development in this country and the direction in which it has gone over the past number of years, particularly with our strong economy.  I want to put an alternative view to some of the mainstream economic issues being debated.  I welcome any sensible legislation on industrial development in the State.  It is an opportunity to open our minds to creative and clean investment.  This is important.</P>
        <P>The purpose of today&rsquo;s legislation is &ldquo;to amend the Industrial Development Act 1993 to provide legislative authority for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to designate the transfer of staff from Shannon Development to Forf&aacute;s and to provide a statutory guarantee to the staff that their pay, conditions of service and pension arrangements shall be in no way diminished by virtue of the transfer&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This is important in light of what has happened in the past 24 hours.  Yesterday, there was a serious industrial dispute between the Bank of Ireland and Amicus workers.  I support the Amicus workers who took a brave and strong decision to fight to defend their pensions.  All Members of the Oireachtas should stand up and be counted in favour of them.  It is important to respect and support Amicus when it takes a stand against the fat cats in senior management in the Bank of Ireland who want to wipe away the terms and conditions they had.  I challenge those who spoke about the Amicus workers on the national airwaves.  To them I say, &ldquo;hands off destroying their pensions&rdquo;.  It is up to legislators and Ministers to keep a close eye on these issues.  We cannot have a situation in which a company like Bank of Ireland, which has extensive resources, fails to deal with the issue and look after its staff pensions.  It is important we nail our colours to the mast on this issue.</P>
        <P>Recently, certain sections of society, particularly the well-off, have constantly undermined the power of trade unions.  This is worrying.  They seem to think that because it is an employers&rsquo; market, one can ride roughshod over workers throughout the country.  Let us remind them that the workers built the Celtic tiger and the strong economy.  It is important when we discuss industrial development that we have a special respect and treatment for trade union members.  Many new industries are hostile to trade unions and this is a sad day for the country.  The problem lies with those who feel threatened by people who want to improve their pension rights, not with the trade union members.  This must be mentioned in this debate and incorporated into the debate on efficiency.  Any sensible person in human resource management knows that if one treats <Col N="1441"/>people with respect and dignity, one will get more productivity from them.  If constantly puts the boot in and erodes their power and pensions, one will undervalue them, reduce their self-esteem and get nowhere.  This is evident in examples from other industries that have collapsed, but also in successful companies.</P>
        <P>According to the explanatory memorandum of the Bill:</P>
        <P LI="1">Section 1 of this Bill contains a definition of the Industrial Development Act 1993.</P>
        <P LI="1">Section 2 amends the Industrial Development Act 1993 by inserting a new section 21A into the Act.</P>
        <P LI="1">Subsection 1 of section 21A defines the term &ldquo;Company&rdquo;, &ldquo;recognised trade union or staff association concerned&rdquo; and &ldquo;transfer date&rdquo; for the purpose of the new section.  [Any terminology with which the Bill refers to staff organisations is good enough for me as long as people are treated with respect and dignity.]</P>
        <P LI="1">Subsection (2) of Section 21A contains an enabling provision that provides legislative authority for the Minister to designate the transfer of staff from Shannon Development to Forf&aacute;s.  Forf&aacute;s is the legal employer of staff of the agencies established under the Industrial Development Acts, i.e. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">From this we have all learned the importance of planning for the future regarding the teaching and development of science education.  Sensible planning of education and targeting of science and information technology has given a tremendous boost to the economy.  It is important we use the talents that exist.  It is essential that these people are recognised properly.</P>
        <P>The explanatory memorandum continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">Subsection (3) of section 21A provides that a staff designated for transfer by the Minister will be appointed to the staff of Forf&aacute;s.  Paragraph 2 (2) of the second Schedule to the Industrial Development Act 1993 gives Forf&aacute;s the power to second staff to the agencies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is important that the staff are brought with them and treated fairly and with respect.</P>
        <P>This raises the issue of decentralisation.  Most sensible people agree that decentralisation is important, strong and sensible, but let us do it by working closely with people, in a planned and phased way and with people&rsquo;s consent.  There is no point trying to force out of Dublin people who have elderly parents or whose children are at school there and moving them to different parts of the country without giving them a choice.  If one plans decentralisation properly, one can have staff support.  However, there seems to be misguided direction on this aspect.</P>
        <P>The issue of the Cadbury factory in Coolock has arisen in my constituency over the past few weeks.  Cadbury has long been a major employer <Col N="1442"/>on the north side of Dublin, has been a good employer and has recognised and supported trade unions.  However, a rationalisation plan has been put in place and most sensible people understand and accept that one must change and adapt in the modern economic climate.  It appears that the 450 job cuts will be voluntary redundancies.  This is essential because many people who have come towards the end of their working lives might be interested in this package.  I am concerned that the day the change was announced, the management spoke about putting &euro;100 million into the development of the Coolock plant.  However, they are forgetting to tell the voters that of the &euro;100 million, &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million is being put into pensions and the same amount into the redundancy package.  Therefore, the development investment could amount to only &euro;20 million.</P>
        <P>I raised this aspect with the Minister this week in a written parliamentary question.  It is important the Minister monitors this issue.  I urge caution.  We must have planned negotiations with the trade unions.  The Coolock staff will hold a large meeting next Saturday.  I urge the Cadbury management, having been a good employer to many people on the north side for many years, to be careful on this issue.  We must ensure everybody is protected in a proper and caring way.</P>
        <P>Some say that due to the Celtic tiger we are in a different, modern society that has replaced the caring society.  We cannot allow this; we can have both.  We have the financial resources and we must use them sensibly and distribute them fairly.  It is essential that the Government targets the extra resources available in the budget at the most needy.  I welcome the hints on the Estimates today that there will be a strong emphasis in the budget on health, education and disability.  It is a focus we must have.  There is no contradiction between the Celtic tiger and a caring society, despite the contrary line which certain Members and right-wing economists outside the House constantly sell.  They contend that this is a modern, macho society in which everyone should try to get rich before walking on the weak.  I put down a marker to the effect that there is no need for that view.  We should face up to reality.</P>
        <P>Education has a vital place in the debate on economic and industrial development.  It is time to take serious action in this area.  OECD education indicators demonstrate that countries which invest in education and skills benefit economically and socially.  If one puts one&rsquo;s money into education, one will benefit from it in future, as we have already proved in Ireland with our highly skilled workforce.  However, warning signs indicate that Ireland is falling behind its competitors in educational investment, which is a serious issue not only for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but also for the Minister for Education and Science.  At each stage of education, Irish spending per student is below the OECD average, especially at primary and second levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on education, <Col N="1443"/>whether expressed as a percentage of GDP or GNP, fell in the period 1995 to 2003.</P>
        <P>Despite the fact that Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, our paltry expenditure on education of 5.2% of GNP in 2005 leaves us languishing among the bottom half dozen OECD countries.  We are placed 24th out of 30 countries.  We have a great deal to do in the education sphere.  The OECD country mean for the ratio of students to teaching staff is 16:6 compared to Ireland&rsquo;s 19:5.  It is important to focus on education in the context of the Bill.  Those who take a cynical view should wake up and smell the coffee.  We have demonstrated clearly through investment in IT and science that jobs develop when educated personnel become available.</P>
        <P>Spending on initiatives to combat educational disadvantage must be refocused to benefit children when they are young.  Most people accept that educational disadvantage must be tackled early rather than when a child is 12 or 13 years of age.  Resources should be provided at pre-school level to break the cycle of disadvantage.  Government reports emphasise the importance of early intervention to tackle disadvantage, but initiatives are not funded on that basis.  Only a fraction of spending to combat disadvantage benefits primary school children &mdash; &euro;60 million compared to more than &euro;300 million at third level &mdash; which is often forgotten.  The result of this policy is that many children experience failure and drop out early due to the Government&rsquo;s refusal to provide adequate support when it is most needed.</P>
        <P>I challenge those private, fee-paying schools whose representatives have been making a great fuss lately, but who have kept young children with disabilities out of the system.  I commend the schools which are radical, creative and brave enough to take on the poorest children in society as well as those with special educational needs.  Certain other schools, however, many of which are fee-paying, have behaved disgracefully by taking the cream while excluding people from broader society.  They then tell the world they top the league tables for secondary education.  It is time for those schools to be told that society is bigger than that.  Elitist schools should be challenged to ensure they include children with disabilities, especially at second level.  Some of them have been operating a form of apartheid as the Minister for Education and Science is well aware.  She knows the schools involved and I hope she does something about them.</P>
        <P>Ireland ranks 29th of 30 countries in its investment in each second level student relative to its GNP <i>per capita</i>.  Any increases in staffing have been to mainstream special educational needs education and cater for international students.  There has been no increase in the ratio according to which teachers are appointed to second level schools since 1999, which means classes of 30 teenagers, including special needs and international pupils, are common.  While I call on the <Col N="1444"/>Government to focus on primary level, it must not forget the children in second level education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Education is increasingly important to economic performance.  Research has demonstrated that high levels of investment in education lead to personal and social benefits, including increased social inclusion, lower crime rates, reduced welfare dependence and improved health.  The old notion that to educate is to liberate is true.  If a person is educated, no matter where he or she comes from, it represents a significant step towards preventing crime, reducing welfare dependence and improving health.  We miss out on the contributions of many creative children because of weaknesses in the education sector, which is a problem we must address.  There are many people who dropped out of education early and did well economically.  We should not be afraid to recognise good practice in the case of those people too.  These are important issues in the context of a debate on an Industrial Development Bill and is essential that we deal with them.</P>
        <P>As an island nation, air and marine transport represent a strategic question of great importance.  The national carrier, Aer Lingus, and Dublin Port are essential to the development of the economy.  We require choice and quality in air services and proper investment in the development of the island as an economic unit through a sensible all-Ireland approach.  In Dublin Bay, scandalous attempts to fill in 52 acres continue.  Dublin Port Company claims it requires more capacity and space but a visit to the docklands reveals numerous empty sites, some of which the company is trying to sell.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, the company claims to the people of Clontarf, Fairview, Killester and Raheny that they want to fill in 52 acres of the bay without giving the matter sensible thought.  I record my opposition to the plan and ask those involved to consider the proposals to develop Bremore Port further up the coast.  We must forget the notion of blocking up the city centre as a result of a congested port.  We must adopt a creative approach, move up the coast and consider the development of a proper port at Bremore as an economic base.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of Members across party lines are open to the idea and even the Taoiseach indicated in a recent interview that he is interested in it.  I push the idea strongly.  Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Loftus, who used to be the Independent Deputy for Dublin North-Central and who represented the people in my constituency very well for many years, put forward the idea that the bay should be kept for our citizens.  We should not interfere with the natural operation of the tides and local sea levels by creating land which is out of balance with the environment.  We must consider the naturally advantageous Bremore Port and be unafraid to invest in a creative and radical plan.  Fresh, important ideas like these are relevant to the debate on this legislation.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s proposed amendment to section 21 of the 1963 Act provides that Shannon Develop<Col N="1445"/>ment staff who are transferred to Forf&aacute;s may not receive a lesser scale of pay or be made subject to less favourable conditions of service than they are entitled to in the original body.  The provision is important to maintain pay rates.  We must ensure that all staff are supported strongly in this context.  It is a question of rewarding labour and good practice.  While there are a number of industries in the State which have created great wealth, the issue of low pay must be tackled.</P>
        <P>Trade union officials and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must ensure the question of low pay is put to bed once and for all.  I will not accept the drift to the right by right-wing economists and Senators concerning economic investment.  We must listen to the voice of workers, who created the Celtic tiger and who are entitled to an equal distribution of resources.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  The Industrial Development Bill has a narrow focus.  It is an enabling Bill that provides security for employees who transfer from Shannon Development.  Their terms and conditions of employment are protected, in line with the views expressed by Deputy Finian McGrath, in respect of employee rights.  The transfer from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland follows a comprehensive consultation process in which all relevant interests in the mid-west had the opportunity to make their views known.  Implementation of the new arrangements will provide clarity on the respective roles of the industrial development agencies in the region.  The agencies will welcome this position. </P>
        <P>Many Deputies referred to industrial development and how it applies to their regions.  All parties welcomed the Bill and were supportive of the role of Shannon Development in the region.  The national development plan will have a strong regional development focus that will underpin the objectives of Shannon Development.  It will also reflect the views articulated by the Deputies on the importance of regional development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national spatial strategy is a key instrument in terms of the regional spread of population and industrial development.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will work closely with Shannon Development to ensure the mid-west continues to enjoy economic success.  The number of people in employment in Ireland has increased by 350,000 since 2000, an increase that has been replicated across all regions.  Employment in the mid-west grew by 20% since 2000.  The unemployment rate for the region is 3.9%, below the average for the State.  One does not often hear that in discussions on jobs in the mid-west and the Shannon region.  The numbers are provided by the CSO, the live register and the quarterly household survey.  The area has a strong industrial base and heritage.</P><Col N="1446"/>
        <P>The new project, Digital River, will involve the creation of 350 new jobs.  We pay tribute to Shannon Development in this regard.  It will be located in Westpark Shannon, a &euro;150 million joint venture between Concre Developments Limited and Shannon Development located in the Shannon free zone.  I visited the facility recently.  It offers the possibility for further development, including job creation, inward investment and indigenous enterprise.  Regeneration of the Shannon free zone is one of the key flagship projects in the new corporate plan of Shannon Development.  The objective is to create 1,500 jobs at the top end of the knowledge and information technology market over the next three years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Halifax Insurance and Sykes Enterprises announced expansions in June.  This will generate 285 new jobs.  The 30-acre information age park in Ennis was opened in May 2005.  It is at the early stage of a long-term development to cater for high-potential start-up companies.  Foreign direct investment companies that IDA Ireland can attract will be located there.  This has the potential to create 3,500 jobs in high-quality accommodation over time.</P>
        <P>The Shannon Development E-Towns project, bringing knowledge-based enterprise activity to towns with populations of 1,500, is well under way.  Four towns were selected, Miltown Malbay, Cappamore, Tarbert and Newport.  The project at Miltown Malbay is the most advanced.  Shannon Broadband connectivity is a project involving eight new towns in the region selected for MANs in 2005.  Delivery is expected in 2006.  A related project, Shannon Connect, will provide services to 80 communities in the region.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development has engaged in these substantive projects and will continue to do so.  Links will be developed with Shannon Airport, which is key infrastructure in terms of economic development in the region.  The role of the University of Limerick, in conjunction with industry and the agencies, will be central to developing a centre of research excellence.  The omens are good because we have had significant success, such as the recent appointments of Dr. David Parnas and Dr. Martin Caffrey.  They will add to the reputation and attraction of the region.  The computational science project at the University of Limerick is another example.  Significant research and development investment has taken place in four projects in 2006, providing long-term sustainability.  In 2005, &euro;19 million was committed to nine IDA Ireland projects in the region.</P>
        <P>The Enterprise Ireland decentralisation programme is on track.  A site for the new Enterprise Ireland headquarters has been identified.  The regional development unit and a county enterprise board co-ordination unit will move to Shannon in 2007.  An interim office has also been found.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Ellis referred to the food industry.  Enterprise Ireland works with a number of food <Col N="1447"/>companies to develop value added activities to support research and development.  Significant announcements of investment have been made by food companies over the past 12 months.  These will add to exports and employment.  I note what Deputy Nolan stated in respect of Carlow.  IDA Ireland is not ignoring Carlow.  I went on missions with IDA Ireland and we are conscious of the business park developed by IDA Ireland.  We are anxious to secure an overseas company to use it.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> the amount of funding provided for military intelligence surveillance for the years 2001 to 2005 and to date in 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no specific allocation of funds for military intelligence.  The cost involved is partly met from funds provided from the Secret Service Vote, which is accounted for by the Minister for Finance, and partly from the relevant subheads of the Defence Vote, including pay from subhead B and allowances from subhead C.</P>
        <P>The total expended on military intelligence is not separately compiled and I do not consider that it would be appropriate to disclose such information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman and apologise for my late entry to the Chamber.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and appreciate the fact that his response is shrouded in a certain amount of mystery.  Notwithstanding that, very little additional money has ever been put in place for military intelligence.  This should be done, particularly in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks.  While I realise the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responsibility for gathering <Col N="1448"/>intelligence in the first instance, does the Minister agree the sum of &euro;800,000 that goes to the Secret Service under the remit of the Minister for Finance &mdash; to which he referred &mdash; is a small amount of money?  The global terrorist threat knows no geographic boundaries.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider the idea of expanding the role of military intelligence?  Perhaps he could enter discussions with the military establishment to examine how it could assist or work in co-operation with the Garda to enhance our intelligence-gathering role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>In the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks, the Government reviewed security arrangements, particularly in respect of military intelligence.  Consequently, in the past three or four years, provision for military intelligence has been substantially increased.  The numbers of Army staff engaged in such work has increased substantially in the past three or four years.</P>
        <P>The sum of &euro;800,000 to which Deputy Timmins refers is misleading as it only constitutes an extremely small element of the total expenditure on military intelligence.  As for the Deputy&rsquo;s question on whether I would consider asking those involved in military intelligence to co-operate with the Garda, the latter force has primary responsibility for security in the State.  However, military intelligence personnel work well with the Garda.</P>
        <P>The Director of Military Intelligence reports to me as Minister at least once a month.  He also reports to the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff on the support side of the Army.  In turn, the Chief of Staff reports to the National Security Committee, of which he is a member.  The role of military intelligence has expanded, particularly in respect of any potential threat from the Middle East or from Islamic terrorists.  For reasons Members will understand, I cannot go into too much detail in this respect.  However, I assure them that resources devoted to military intelligence have increased substantially and the figure of &euro;800,000 is misleading in terms of the total expenditure on military intelligence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his response.  I have a final supplementary question.  The Minister is the chairperson of the task force on national emergency planning.  While one might disagree on its implementation, does he agree it would be beneficial to include an intelligence section within its remit, comprising the Garda, the Army, Customs and Excise, the Revenue Commissioners and possibly a communications element?</P>
        <P>I realise that no matter how much money one devotes to protecting the State from terrorist attack &mdash; one could spend billions &mdash; it may not be successful.  However, the assignment of sufficient resources to prevention and surveillance can greatly assist in thwarting attacks.  If <Col N="1449"/>one lacks inter-agency operability, people may get through the net.  However, if such groups were brought together, one&rsquo;s intelligence remit would be strengthened.  Will the Minister consider the development of such a concept?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take on board any constructive suggestions.  It is impossible, as countries such as Israel and the United states will testify, to have a system that provides absolute protection against the possibility of a terrorist attack.  Nevertheless, the emergency planning committee includes the Garda and the Army, as well as the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence.  It receives regular threat assessments when it meets.  Deputy Timmins has suggested the Revenue Commissioners, Customs and Excise and a number of similar bodies should be brought onto the emergency planning task force.  I will look into this aspect.  While there is probably some reason they are not already there, I will consider the suggestion.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> if he will arrange for the force of 56 soldiers who are currently deployed with EUFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina to search for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extremely difficult for any family when a member of the family goes missing far from home.  I can only empathise with the terrible situation in which the family find themselves.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has the lead role in respect of this issue.  I understand from him that extensive efforts have been made by the consular service of the Department of Foreign Affairs to assist and support the family at this difficult time.  The consular service has also maintained ongoing contact with the local police force, rescue services, politicians and senior officials in the region in which the town of Medjugorje is situated.  Diplomatic officers and the ambassador have travelled from the Irish Embassy in Slovenia, which is also accredited to Bosnia-Herzegovina, to the region to review the search arrangements.</P>
        <P>Since the person&rsquo;s disappearance, there have been six large scale searches, some of which involved the use of a helicopter.  In addition to such large scale searches, there have been other, more localised, searches.  The search continues and an officer from the Irish Embassy will again shortly visit Medjugorje to review the situation.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Costello will appreciate, primary responsibility for conducting the search lies with the civil authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  It is not open to me simply to redeploy Irish Defence Forces personnel on a search mission within the borders of another sovereign state.  The operational status of the Defence Forces personnel <Col N="1450"/>currently deployed in Operation Althea, the EU-led operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is determined by their mission and the mandate given to the mission by the United Nations.  They cannot all simply be directed to leave their posts to undertake a search operation.  From both a legal and an operational perspective, this would be untenable.</P>
        <P>That said, to date the search has been supported and assisted, as far as is practicable, by the Defence Forces personnel based in the country.  During the initial search, the head of the EU monitoring mission released an Irish staff officer in Mostar to act as liaison.  In addition, following a request from the EU police mission, EUFOR provided a helicopter that conducted a number of search flights in September and October.  Defence Forces personnel have also provided assistance where possible through their local knowledge and contacts.  I expect that the Defence Forces, within the requirements of their mission, will continue to assist in whatever way they can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I believe the Irish authorities in both the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces have done a good job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, a number of questions must be resolved.  First, a 59 year old lady, who had been to Medjugorje previously, went missing between 4 and 6 September.  The vagueness as to when she went missing suggests that no immediate reporting of the event took place.  Second, the police in Medjugorje did not interview any of the other pilgrims who had accompanied her to ascertain who might have last seen her, what were the circumstances and so on.  There has been such severe criticism of the local authorities in Medjugorje regarding the failure to conduct an investigation that the family believe something of a cover-up took place and that the authorities there do not want any public dissemination of news that a person may have gone missing.  It transpires that seven or eight other people have also vanished into thin air.  This raises the question as to whether something more sinister may be afoot.</P>
        <P>The direct family members are greatly dissatisfied regarding the conduct of the local authorities.  Consequently, because of the lack of urgency and the absence of a comprehensive approach, on behalf of the family, I ask the Minister of Defence to make available some or all of the 56 soldiers serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</P>
        <P>In addition to the 56 soldiers serving in Bosnia, over 100 troops are stationed in Kosovo so there are many troops in the region.  It should not be difficult to put together a substantial force to carry out a thorough search of the area.  It is now ten weeks since the lady in question went missing and her family feels it would be wonderful if the Irish authorities based in the vicinity could do something directly.  Will the Minister consider making Irish troops or a portion of them available for an intensive search?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1451"/>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I note Deputy Costello&rsquo;s comments about the initial investigation and I do not wish to comment one way or another on it.  According to information received by me, there have been six large scale searches and a number of more localised searches.  The information received by us indicates that there has been no deficiency in the follow-up searches and that the local authorities are doing everything they can.  </P>
        <P>While I share Deputy Costello&rsquo;s sentiments, the question remains as to whether we can unilaterally deploy Irish troops in this search.  I recall a case in the past few months in my own constituency where a young man went missing.  He was missing for some time, people feared the worst and the garda&iacute; failed to find him, despite their best efforts.  His mother came to me in a state of considerable anguish and asked me to bring in the Army.  When I spoke to the local officer commanding in Sarsfield Barracks, he told me that while representations had been made to him because some of the young man&rsquo;s relatives were in the Army, he could do nothing because he had received no request for help from the local police.  Even in this country, the Army cannot intervene in such circumstances without being requested to do so by the civil authorities.</P>
        <P>We are talking about a foreign country &mdash; Bosnia-Herzegovina.  At least in the initial stages, the task of searching for this woman is exclusively a matter for the local civil authorities.  If they were to make any request to me to deploy some of the Irish troops on their soil or in nearby Kosovo, I would look at it sympathetically.  However, in the absence of such a request, I am not entitled unilaterally to deploy Irish troops.</P>

The retirement was effected pursuant to section 47(2) of the Defence Act 1954 and paragraph 18(1)(<i>f</i>) of Defence Force Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo;.  The House will appreciate that a decision to retire an officer &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo; is only taken for the most compelling reasons.  The Government advice to the President in 1969 was on grounds of security.  I am satisfied that the matter was handled in an entirely appropriate and proper manner in 1969 and that the decision was taken only after very detailed and due consideration.</P>
        <P>The individual initiated proceedings in the High Court in November 1998 in respect of the circumstances of his retirement some 29 years earlier.  The High Court found in favour of the State in June 1999 on grounds of inordinate delay in the bringing of the proceedings.  The individual appealed to the Supreme Court in September 1999.  The Supreme Court refused the appeal in January 2001.</P>
        <P>In early July 2002, arising from a newspaper feature article on the case published on 29 June 2002, the then Minister for Defence requested the Judge Advocate General to examine and review the case.  The Judge Advocate General, a civilian barrister, carried out a detailed examination and review of all the historical documentation relating to the decision to retire the individual concerned by reference to the entirety of both the Department of Defence and the military files in the matter.  Her report was submitted to the then Minister in mid-September 2002 and was published in October 2002.</P>
        <P>In December 2002, the individual applied to the High Court for an order quashing this report by the Judge Advocate General.  The High Court found in favour of the applicant for reasons enumerated in the text of the High Court judgment on his application.  The High Court judgment of 27 July 2005 related only to the report completed by the civilian Judge Advocate General in September 2002.  The presiding judge, Mr. Justice Quirke, held that the report should be quashed because fair procedures had not been applied in the compilation and production of that report and in the timing of the release by the Department of Defence of certain documents to the applicant.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Quirke concluded his judgment by stating that &ldquo;the decision made in 1969 to recommend the Applicant&rsquo;s retirement from the Defence Forces remains unaffected by any order made in these proceedings&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1453"/>
        <P>It should be emphasised, therefore, that the High Court judgment in the matter of the report of the Judge Advocate General specifically related to the actual procedures utilised by the Judge Advocate General in the course of her review and examination of this matter in 2002 and to the release by the Department of Defence of certain documents to the individual only after completion of the report.  The individual concerned specifically did not seek an order for <i>mandamus</i> from the High Court and, therefore, did not request the High Court to remit the matter, to direct a resumption of the Judge Advocate General&rsquo;s original inquiry or to direct that a new inquiry be held by the Judge Advocate General or by any other person.</P>
        <P>The substantive issue, namely, the Government decision in 1969 to recommend the retirement of this individual from the Defence Forces by the President, remains unaffected by the judgment of the High Court, a point specifically emphasised within the text of the judgment itself.  A book on this case was published in May 2006 which did not add anything material to our previous body of knowledge in the matter.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to take any further action in respect of this matter.</P>
  </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a long-standing case which has spanned 37 years.  The person in question, Donal de R&oacute;iste, has maintained and sought to prove his innocence to such an extent that the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Smith, acknowledged that there were questions to be answered by requesting the Judge Advocate General to investigate the matter.  Does the Minister accept that the High Court ruling in 2005 preventing the publication of the Judge Advocate General&rsquo;s report leaves the way open for him to ask for another such inquiry rather than force Donal de R&oacute;iste to go through the courts?  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform continually informs us that the courts are clogged up.  If alternative methods and avenues exist by which the truth in this instance can be gleaned, they should be pursued.  An independent inquiry would be one of these mechanisms.  </P>
        <P>The High Court ruling basically concluded that the Judge Advocate General&rsquo;s inquiry denied Mr. de R&oacute;iste fair procedures.  Some of it stems from the fact that some of the witnesses are those who are able to contribute a defence or, at least, give some of the facts relating to the case, such as the retired Army commandant, Patrick Walsh, and the fact that the High Court judge might have been concerned about the fact that the Judge Advocate General refused to meet this man who would have been able to put some more bones on this story.  Will the Minister establish an inquiry, possibly under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which would grant Mr. de R&oacute;iste fair procedures for the first time?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1454"/>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that the High Court decision of 2005 opens the door to another inquiry or in any way indicates that an injustice has been done to Mr. de R&oacute;iste.  We must remember that two decisions were made, one by the High Court and the other by the Supreme Court, which all witnesses were entitled to attend and where Mr. de R&oacute;iste was entitled to present his full case.  On the substantive facts of the case, the High Court found and the Supreme Court subsequently agreed that too much time had elapsed and that, therefore, Mr. de R&oacute;iste was not in a position to prove his case.  This is the reality of the matter.  </P>
        <P>In 2005, Mr. Justice Quirke decided that the procedure established under the Judge Advocate General was incorrectly conducted.  From reading the judgment in full, it appears that if one was to hold an inquiry, one would need a different procedure.  One would need to use the procedure suggested by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, namely, a sworn public inquiry where witnesses would be called.  It appears that the difficulty with this is that, on one side, one would have Mr. de R&oacute;iste, but practically all the witnesses on the other side are dead.  I believe one or two are still alive but they are too incapacitated to attend.  Therefore, one would have an oral presentation on one side against the silent testimony of the archival documents on the other.  This form of inquiry is not very fair.</P>
        <P>In the 2005 case, Mr. de R&oacute;iste did not seek an order of <i>mandamus</i>, any follow-up order or the recommencement of the Judge Advocate General&rsquo;s inquiry so this is where the matter stands.  We cannot have a proper inquiry based on physical evidence on the one side and documents or archives on the other.  It seems that if we have to come within the terms of what the High Court wanted in 2005, that is all we could have.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> the position in relation to the commitment given in the White Paper on Defence to have a Defence Forces strength of 10,500 plus 250 in training; if this commitment has been honoured; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[38350/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The White Paper on Defence was published in February 2000.  It provided for a strength of 10,500 for the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, comprised of 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.  At the time of publication the strength of the Permanent Defence Force stood at approximately 11,500.  This was reduced to 10,500 by the end of 2001.  The White Paper also provided that the Chief of Staff could maintain an additional 250 personnel in training at any one time.  That provision was withdrawn in June 2003 as part of the Government decision on managing public service numbers.  The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 30 September 2006, the latest date for which detailed figures are available, as advised by the military authorities, was 10,383. </P>
        <P>It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces.  Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs.  The strength of the Defence Forces as at 31 December in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, was 10,498, 10,551 and 10,446.  There are no plans to review the established strength of 10,500 as set out in the White Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I note from the Estimates for the Department of Defence that the total Defence budget is similar to the increase in health expenditure.  It is a small budget.  The commitments placed on the Defence Forces have increased since the publication of the White Paper.  A solemn commitment was given by the former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith,  of a strength of 10,500 plus 250 personnel in training.  However, that was withdrawn by him shortly afterwards, not long after the 2002 general election.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister restore the strength to include that figure of 250 personnel in the context of permitting an overall strength of 10,750?  It was mercurial the way the Defence Forces were told they were allowed have a strength of 10,500 and maintain 250 personnel in training and then that commitment was withdrawn.  Those figures were not constant because once personnel were trained they moved into the category of the 10,500 personnel.  However, it transpired that the strength of 10,500 personnel fell slightly and personnel <Col N="1456"/>were brought in to be trained, but the strength of the Defence Forces never reached 10,500 personnel and the maintenance of 250 personnel in training.  I stand to be corrected on that &mdash; perhaps it was reached for a short duration.  Will the Minister preferably increase the strength to 10,750 personnel inclusive or revert to a strength of 10,500 personnel and the maintenance of 250 personnel in training?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to today&rsquo;s Estimates, I am delighted that for the first time in the history of the State the defence budget has exceeded &euro;1 million.  It has always been a small budget compared to the budgets for the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Health and Children etc.</P>
        <P>On the matter of the exact terms of that 2001 commitment, my understanding is that the commitment was to maintain an Army, a Permanent Defence Force of 10,500.  The Chief of Staff was permitted to maintain an extra 250 personnel in training, but the overall strength of the Permanent Defence Force would not exceed 10,500.  Therefore, the commitment was not as binding as the Deputy suggests.  That commitment was adhered to.  The Government at its discretion &mdash; it retained the discretion under the original decision &mdash; told the Chief of Staff that it could no longer permit him to maintain the extra 250 personnel in training because the Department of Defence wanted to play its part in controlling public service numbers.</P>
        <P>I assure Deputy Timmins that at the time of publication of the White Paper the overall strength of the Army and what we would need was assessed &mdash; that continues to be assessed &mdash; in the context of providing the required number of personnel to improve equipment, training, facilities etc., and the conclusion was that 10,500 would be required.</P>
        <P>Our troops are doing a magnificent job abroad, as everybody is aware.  We have committed up to 830 troops abroad, which is a big commitment given the size of our country and Army.  My information is that the Army is sufficiently large for present day requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned that when the White Paper was published the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 11,500 but that due to the cutbacks in the public service, the strength of the Defence Forces was reduced to 10,500 and the provision for the 250 personnel in training was no longer maintained.  Were there any cutbacks in the number of civilians in the Department of Defence in that period, given that there was a 10% reduction in the strength of the Army?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The civilian section of the Department of Defence is small in terms of numbers compared to the Army.  In 2001 we reduced the strength from 11,500 to 10,500 but as a <i>quid pro <Col N="1457"/>quo</i> we invested a great deal of money in equipment, training, facilities etc.  We now have a professionally organised and successful Army which is admired all over the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Were the civilian figures reduced accordingly during that period?</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> if he will publish the report on the investigation he has commissioned into the Niemba ambush in the Congo; if he will give due recognition to the two survivors of the ambush; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I undertook during Priority Questions on Thursday, 23 February 2006 to ask the military authorities to revisit this matter in light of the questions raised on that date.   The Chief of Staff appointed Colonel Tom Behan to examine all aspects of the Niemba ambush.  Due to the breadth of this investigation, this process has taken some time.   I have now had a chance to review this report.  I congratulate Colonel Behan for the time and effort he has expended in researching this sensitive and harrowing episode in Irish military history.</P>
        <P>The ambush occurred almost 46 years ago.  It was the first such action involving the horrific deaths of Defence Forces personnel on a scale which still remains unique.  It has never been very far from public consciousness.  However, the actual horror of the event has faded from the national psyche at this remove.  This report will bring the issue back into sharp focus for anybody who will read it.  I publicly acknowledge the sacrifice made by all the members of the patrol at that time.  I again extend my deepest sympathy to the families of all those who died.  I take this opportunity to underline the courage, fortitude and tenacity displayed by Privates Kenny and Fitzpatrick in order to survive.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will now concentrate on the conclusions of the report.  On 8 November 1960, an 11-man patrol, commanded by Lieutenant Kevin Gleeson was attacked by a large number of Baluba tribesmen while on patrol from their base at Niemba and were quickly overwhelmed.  There are two principal areas of controversy in regard to the record of this ambush, both of which concern Trooper Browne and Private Kenny.  The first question is where exactly did Trooper Browne die and the second is what did Trooper Browne do to contribute to the survival of Private Kenny.</P>
        <P>In regard to where Trooper Browne died, from the extensive research and interviews carried out by Colonel Behan, his final conclusion is that <Col N="1458"/>Trooper Browne fired his weapon to distract the Baluba attackers from their task of beating Private Kenny to death.  He further concludes, on the balance of probabilities, that Trooper Browne managed to then escape his pursuers, wounded or otherwise, making his way to the village of Tundula only to be killed by hostile Balubas two days later.   Therefore, the previous supposition that he died at the ambush site and that Baluba tribesmen carried away his remains cannot be substantiated.  Likewise, the conclusion outlined above that he died at Tundula cannot be definitively substantiated.</P>

	<P>The remainder of the reply will be included in the Official Report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, while this is not my priority question, it is important, if it is agreeable to the House, to allow the Minister to read the full reply into the record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A full transcript will be recorded on Question Time, even though the Minister has only two minutes to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This is my question and we should allow the Minister the time to read the full reply as it is such an important issue of concern to many Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The second area of controversy in regard to the record of the Niemba ambush is what did Trooper Browne do to contribute to the survival of Private Kenny.  The report clearly concludes that prior to his escape from the ambush site, Trooper Browne fired his weapon at the Balubas who were intent on beating Private Kenny to death, thereby distracting them and saving his life.  The Medal Board that was convened in 1961 awarded Trooper Browne the military medal for gallantry.</P>
        <P>Despite all the research, consultation and interviews, there is no absolute certainty achievable in regard to these two matters of controversy.  I wish, however, to address some of the ambiguity that may have resulted from the two scenarios recorded in the unit history.  In the absence of the wide and detailed research available to me now, the best advice previously available to me was that Trooper Browne most likely died at the scene of the ambush and the Baluba tribesmen carried his remains away.  This must now be discounted.</P>
        <P>I wholeheartedly recognise and acknowledge that Private Kenny, particularly in view of the serious wounds and injuries he sustained, and Private Fitzpatrick survived a horrific encounter with hostile forces, displaying courage, fortitude and tenacity in order to survive until finally rescued.  I commend them both for the selfless service they gave to their country and hope that this report will bring some peace of mind to them both.</P><Col N="1459"/>
        <P>While the award of a medal was not recommended, I am examining proposals as to how best these two men&rsquo;s contribution can be suitably recognised and honoured.  In addition, I intend to invite both at the earliest opportunity to attend a suitable Defence Forces event at which I will acknowledge their contribution publicly.  I also have made arrangements today for copies of the official report on the Niemba ambush to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and for commissioning the report, the contents of which he indicated.  I also compliment Colonel Behan for an extremely clear and succinct report.  In the Gallery is Dr. David O&rsquo;Donoghue, who recently brought much of this to the attention of people in his book, <i>The Irish Army in the Congo 1960-1964: The Far Battalions</i>.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Most of all, I acknowledge the two survivors of the Niemba ambush, Mr. Joe Fitzpatrick and Mr. Tom Kenny, who tenaciously campaigned for 46 years to recover their reputations, which they believe were severely maligned, clear their good names and right the record once and for all.  A number of years ago, I had the privilege of launching the book written by Joe Fitzpatrick, <i>My Time in the Congo</i>.  Mr. Fitzpatrick is also in the Gallery.</P>
        <P>Considering this has taken 46 years, and given the trauma and suffering those men and their families experienced due to the loss of their good names, will the Minister explain why we do not have a solution to this matter?  Why was the record not cleared before it reached this stage?</P>
        <P>Mr. Kenny seeks an apology from the Army and the Department of Defence.  Is the Minister prepared to make that apology?  Mr. Fitzpatrick seeks a medal.  Is the Minister prepared to award that medal?  The Minister indicated he is prepared to publish the report, which is worthwhile.  The two survivors are at odds with each other on what type of recognition they feel is proper.  Will the Minister provide clarity on how he intends to give due recognition and indicate what he will do?</P>
        <P>I will quote from the recommendations which are solid and clear:</P>
        <P LI="1">Thomas Kenny and Joe Fitzpatrick should have their reputations copperfastened by official recognition and acknowledgement that they survived an horrific encounter with hostile forces, displaying fortitude and tenacity in order to survive until finally rescued.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister be specific on what type of recognition he is prepared to give?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with why this matter has taken until now.  This issue was one of the first raised with me after I became Minister of Defence.  I commissioned a report to properly research the matter.  The question was initially asked by Deputies Gregory and Finian McGrath and I was delighted to respond to their concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that we have fuller information, I am required to officially correct the record and I have no difficulty with doing so.  I also have no difficulty with making an apology to the two men if the original record at my Department got the facts wrong.  I apologise for any trauma or grief caused by the fact that the record was incorrect.</P>
        <P>It is not within my power to grant a medal.  That is a matter for the Army, which decides on who is awarded medals.  In this case it recommended not to do so, which is no reflection on either of the gentlemen in question.  Detailed considerations are involved.  After two military boards, the Army has not recommended medals.  I cannot tell the Army when to award a medal.</P>
        <P>The report has just come into the public domain and the type of recognition to be given is still under discussion.  I hope we will find a way to adequately recognise the courage and fortitude of these two men.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 25, 39 and 42 together.</P>
        <P>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, was originally established on 19 March 1978 under United Nations Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426, following the then invasion of Lebanon by Israel.  In response to the crisis of July and August 2006, under UN Security Council Resolution 1701 the UN decided to extend the mandate of UNIFIL to the end of August 2007, and to increase its troop strength from approximately 2,000 troops to a maximum of 15,000.</P>
        <P>The council also decided that, in addition to carrying out its original mandate under Council Resolutions 425 and 426, UNIFIL would also monitor the cessation of hostilities; accompany and support the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy throughout southern Lebanon and extend its assistance to help ensure humanitarian access to civilian populations and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons.</P>
        <P>The nature of the expanded UNIFIL mandate is such that its role is to be considerably more robust than it was prior to the adoption of Resolution 1701, while still operating under Chapter VI of the UN Charter.  UNIFIL will assist the Government of Lebanon to exercise its authority throughout the UNIFIL area of operations.  It will take all necessary action, acting in support of the Government of Lebanon, &ldquo;to ensure that its area of operations is not utilised for hostile activities of any kind and to resist attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the mandate of the Security Council&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Following the ceasefire which took effect on 14 August 2006, the Government monitored the situation with a view to determining how best Ireland might contribute to the expanded UNIFIL mission.  Against this background, an option was identified whereby Ireland might partner Finnish troops and provide a protection detail to a planned Finnish engineering company.</P>
        <P>On 3 October 2006, the Government authorised, subject to D&aacute;il approval, the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to UNIFIL.  The necessary enabling motion was moved in the D&aacute;il on 10 October 2006 and approved on 11 October 2006.</P>
        <P>The 34th Irish Infantry Group deployed to South Lebanon on 31 October 2006 as part of the integrated Finnish-Irish battalion.  The Irish group has a total strength of 158 personnel, comprising 21 officers, 58 NCOs, 78 privates and a chaplain.  The Finnish engineer group comprises 211 Finnish military personnel.  In addition, six Defence Forces personnel continue to be deployed at UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura.</P>
        <P>The Finnish-Irish battalion is located in Sector East of the UNIFIL area of operations, at a newly constructed camp, known as Camp Ida, near the village of Ebel Es Saqi in the general area of Blate.  The Finnish engineering unit will carry out tasks in support of UNIFIL and also some <Col N="1462"/>humanitarian work, including dealing with unexploded ordnance clearance.  While the Irish unit will be tasked primarily with providing protection to the Finnish engineering company, it will also be available to undertake other security tasks as may be directed by the UNIFIL force commander.</P>
        <P>The Irish mechanised company has significant force protection capabilities and assets, including 12 Mowag armoured personnel carriers and is supported by a cavalry troop with its six AML armoured cars.  These armoured assets provide the unit with significant protection, firepower and a mobility capability.  The threat assessment in the short term is considered low, with the main danger being posed by the significant amount of unexploded ordnance and war debris which remains in the area.</P>
        <P>Initial deployment is for one year subject to renewal of the mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission at that time.  In line with standing policy that the duration of any deployment should be set at the outset of a mission, it is considered that Defence Forces involvement in UNIFIL should not exceed a maximum of two to three years in duration.  I look forward to visiting the Irish contingent serving with UNIFIL in the near future when they have settled into their new camp and when the unit has become fully operational.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply to a subject in which we are all interested.  Many Deputies, particularly in the Dublin region, know people who are serving in that force.  There are certainly people from my constituency serving with it.  Earlier today, those of us who listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; will have heard the interview with the Muslim extremist.  We all saw the &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; programme the other night also.  In light of the threat from that cleric, who I understand is from Lebanon, what risk analysis has been carried out with regard to the involvement of our troops in Lebanon, particularly before they left?  Does the Minister have any intelligence concerning the current level of threat to Irish personnel there?  I understand the Minister will be going to Lebanon soon so perhaps he might mention me if he meets anyone there from my constituency.  What action will the Minister take to raise those threats that have been made on the airwaves, including RTE, at the highest levels of the Lebanese Government?  I heard that broadcast this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should put a question please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my question.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is going off script.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  At my age, I sometimes need to have notes but I do not use scripts.  The <Col N="1463"/>Minister should understand the level of interest in this subject, particularly in light of threats that have been made on the airwaves. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>A detailed threat assessment was carried out jointly with the Finns during a reconnaissance mission to Lebanon in September.  We also consulted closely with UNIFIL and some of the other nations involved.  The threat assessment was &ldquo;low but within a volatile situation&rdquo;.  In other words, while the threat is low at the moment, a number of issues could trigger a conflict again.  That assessment is not dissimilar to those that preceded the despatch of troops to Liberia and Kosovo.  We are keeping the situation under ongoing review.  The threat assessment remains the same.</P>
        <P>There are a number of matters in Lebanon, for example, the future disarming of Hizbollah, which could be potential flashpoints.  The resupply of Hizbollah by Syria is also a potential flashpoint, among others.  There are a number of al-Qaeda camps in southern Lebanon, which train jihadists on the way to Iraq.  We do not know what action, if any, the Lebanese army will take in that regard.  We are aware of all those potential flashpoints.  We have deployed the troops for a year and will reconsider the situation next August or September.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy O&rsquo;Connor suggested that we should raise the matter with the Lebanese Government at the highest level.  I will be meeting Lebanese Government officials on my forthcoming trip to Lebanon during which I will express my concern for the safety of our troops.  I can also assure the Deputy that if I happen to meet anybody from Tallaght I will certainly mention his name.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said he will raise the matter with the Lebanese Government but that is if we have any such government.  That is surely the biggest potential flashpoint.  The leader of Hizbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has said there may not be a Lebanese Government because it may collapse.  He has accused members of that government of collaborating with the Israelis.  Does the Minister agree that this situation is extremely volatile?  Under those circumstances, what contingency plans does he have to remove our troops if the situation becomes very serious?  The Minister spoke about a time span of two to three years but has he discussed the issue with his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  If there are no talks a vacuum will arise, which is a serious situation in itself.  Does the Minister agree that the sooner we have real talks, as Tony Blair has suggested &mdash; at long last common sense is prevailing &mdash; and the Iranians and Syrians are at the table, that will be the best way to get stability?  It would be the best solution for our troops in the long term.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1464"/>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Gormley on the latter point.  I have had ongoing discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the matter.  The two to three-year timescale can be a bit misleading.  The last time we went into Lebanon we intended to spend a few years there but finished up spending 23 years in the country.  The Government has made it clear that the maximum deployment to Lebanon will be two to three years.  The current deployment, however, is only until next August.  Coming up to next August we will have to re-examine the situation.  Depending upon the position then, it may be that we will not be going back there in August.  We just do not know and that has to be decided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to support my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, in expressing concern for our troops in their overseas role.  They deserve our congratulations.  The concern arises from the threat assessment.  Will the Minister clarify the need for triple-lock approval?  Does it apply in all situations?  Will the Minister indicate briefly what criteria apply before deciding to deploy Defence Forces contingents on overseas missions?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The triple-lock mechanism, involving Government and D&aacute;il approval together with a UN resolution, applies in all cases where troops are deployed, under arms, on overseas peacekeeping missions.  Under the provisions of the Defence Act, D&aacute;il approval is not required if the number going overseas is fewer than 12.</P>
        <P>On the criteria that apply, we must first decide how usefully Ireland can contribute to the mission.  In addition, we must decide how well the mission is financed and how it gels with the demands of Irish foreign policy.  Apart from whether our troops can improve the situation out there, the risk to our troops is the paramount consideration.  That is something to which any Government sending troops abroad from this country has always paid great attention.  Before making an informed decision, one must take advice and gather intelligence from the people who go out on reconnaissance and other relevant military personnel, as well as UN people.  Therefore, the criteria comprise the list I have outlined along with the requirements of the triple-lock, which means UN authorisation, a Government decision and D&aacute;il approval.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the location of the troops, are they all located in the same place?  Are they all in a supporting role with the Finnish engineering unit?  Are they likely to be moving around, considering the type of work that will be required of an engineering unit?  Will Irish troops be getting involved in any humanitarian activities or are they so involved at this time?  When the first six months are up, as part of the assessment to be undertaken will the Minister produce a formal report that will be laid before the House for debate?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1465"/>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what is the practice as regards the third issue raised by the Deputy, or whether we do that after six months.  I will inquire and if there is no problem with it I will be happy to discuss the matter after six months.</P>
        <P>As regards the deployment of troops, they will be in the general area of Blatt beside the village of Belasaki in the eastern sector, south of the Litani river.  They will all be in the same place at the joint Irish-Finnish Camp Ida.  They will be moving around providing protection details for Finnish engineers when they are doing construction work.  They will also be providing protection details for Finnish troops when they are clearing unexploded ordnance.  In addition, they will be undertaking other tasks assigned to them by the UNIFIL force commander, which could include security duty in other locations, escort duty and patrols.  Ultimately, therefore, even though their primary duty is to protect the Finnish engineers, they are liable to be assigned to other duties by the force commander, which could include humanitarian work.</P>

	<P>I wish to be associated with Deputy Costello&rsquo;s remarks on the report the Minister commissioned on the Niemba ambush.  I compliment the Minister and Colonel Behan on that, in addition to Dr. O&rsquo;Donoghue. I am sure when the Minister is in Lebanon he will pass on the regards of Senator Brian Hayes, the spokesperson on defence for the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad, to any troops he meets.</P>

	<P>Has the Minister received any requests for additional troops to be sent to Lebanon?  Is there a chance we could increase our commitment there when we are finished in Liberia?

Good faith is fine but it would be nice to see good works also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly pass on Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s felicitations when I am in Lebanon.  I have had no request for additional troops there.  We still have 320 troops in Liberia but they will be finished next summer and will be available to go elsewhere.  There are several places that could request our services.</P><Col N="1466"/>
        <P>Overseas allowances must go through the conciliation and arbitration process but I said at the PDFORRA conference that such a request would be very sympathetically considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Defence for correcting the D&aacute;il record on the Niemba case and the inquiry.  I urge the Army to honour Private Kennedy and Private Fitzpatrick.  </P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to make the protection of civilians in Lebanon the priority issue when bringing a message to the United Nations and the armed forces.  He can use his authority and the forum of the UN to ensure the maximum protection of civilians is achieved, particularly given the men, women and children slaughtered there recently.  It is important that this be a priority of the Irish troops serving there as part of the UN force.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The priorities of the troops are set by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, force commander.  One of the duties envisaged for the Lebanese Army when it enters southern Lebanon is not only the protection of civilians, but allowing them access to humanitarian assistance and Irish troops will play a part in this regard.  Ireland is working hard at the United Nations, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to have the law changed to considerably restrict the use of cluster weapons which were deployed to such ill-effect in Lebanon.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government decided on 1 July 2003 that lands at Gormanstown, County Meath, would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative.  How land at this location might play a role in the delivery of affordable units is a matter in the first instance for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the development of the affordable housing initiative.  The legal formalities relating to the transfer of lands at this location under the affordable housing initiative are being progressed in consultation with that Department and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister concerned that the construction of affordable housing in that area could affect the use by the Air Corps of the region as a range?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an obvious consideration that we have taken into account and the deal will <Col N="1467"/>be constructed so that there is no interference with Air Corps activities.  We are still negotiating that point, among others, with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The transfer is taking some time and it will take another year.</P>
        <P>The news is better regarding other lands that are being handed over.  We have completed a transfer at St. Brychan&rsquo;s and other lands at McGee Camp and Camp Field at Collins Barracks in Cork are almost ready for transfer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What is the acreage of the lands being handed over and how much will be retained by the Department of Defence?  If this land is for affordable housing, will it be sold to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  Is it part of a transfer arrangement to be conducted by the affordable homes partnership chaired by Des Geraghty?  Will it be handed over to the local authority or how will the affordable housing be developed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The lands in question are around 261 acres in size and about 57 acres are used for the Army camp.  Some 25 acres is cut off from the main body of land by a roadway.  The matter of how much will be handed over has not yet been finalised, although I would guess it will be about half of the 261 acre total. </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s brief is to hand the lands over to Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I understand that Department will discuss a possible land swop with a local developer or will give the land to such an individual in return for a certain number of houses.  I am not sure of the details as they are being dealt with by other people, but I can supply more specific information if the Deputy wishes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not like to see the Department of Defence become a soft touch for <Col N="1468"/>giving away land because when local authorities dispose of lands to State Departments, they get top dollar.  The Government has committed that money received from the disposal of Defence Forces land will be reinvested in the Defence Forces.  We must ensure we receive market value as this was not achieved with land given away in the recent past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>

	<P>I see the point Deputy Timmins is making.  The land bank available to the Department of Defence is kept under constant review.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 45 and 222 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland is currently contributing 826 Defence Forces personnel to 19 different missions throughout the world.  Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas on UN mandated operations, observer missions or undertaking representative or staff postings are listed in the following tabular statement.</P>
        <P>The main overseas commitments are to the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, with 320 personnel; the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, led international security pres<Col N="1469"/>ence, Kosovo Force, KFOR, with 211 personnel; the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 164 personnel; and to the EU led operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, EUFOR, with 59 personnel.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, UN, the European Union, EU, and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A contingent of the Permanent Defence Force was deployed for service with UNMIL in December 2003, comprising a motorised infantry battalion of 430 personnel.  The main Irish contingent operates as the force commander&rsquo;s rapid reaction reserve.  The role of the Irish personnel is the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force, to provide a swift and decisive military reaction in any crisis situation.  The contingent undertakes regular daily patrols within Monrovia and is available to the force commander to provide support in the event of a breakdown of law and order or further conflict.  Ireland will complete its participation in UNMIL in May 2007 and the 96th Infantry Battalion, which is currently being deployed to UNMIL, will be the final Defence Forces deployment to the mission.</P><Col N="1470"/>
        <P>KFOR was established in June 1999 to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo so as to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities.  Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999.  The Irish contingent currently comprises an APC mounted infantry group of 211 personnel, including a number of personnel in staff posts at various KFOR headquarters.  Having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo and subject to ongoing assessments of the position on the ground, Ireland has decided to maintain a continued presence in KFOR in 2006-07.  Ireland will take on the role of framework nation for the multinational task force in which it participates in August 2006 for a period of 12 months.</P>
        <P>Operation Althea, EUFOR, is an EU military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Ireland has participated in SFOR since 1997 and has 59 troops stationed in the region as part of an Austrian-led multinational task force.  We provide personnel for the headquarters, military police unit, verification teams and a national support element.  Ireland currently acts as the framework nation for the military police platoon.  Discussions on down-sizing this mission, which is expected to commence early next year, are ongoing at EU level.  I have discussed the position in Lebanon.</P><Col N="1469"/>

	<P>Will the Minister provide a breakdown of the total number of officers and other ranks  serving overseas?  Deputies discussed threat assessment, injuries and so forth in response to one of my previous questions.  Will the Minister indicate the number of personnel serving overseas in support services, specifically the medical corps?  Will he also provide a breakdown according to profession?  How many doctors, dentists, paramedics and other support personnel are serving overseas?  Are difficulties being experienced in recruiting any of these personnel, particularly in dentistry?</P>
        <P>This week, I read with interest a report in one of the newspapers that Sweden, the framework nation in the Nordic battle group, has reservations about Ireland&rsquo;s requirement to secure triple lock approval.  Did the Minister see the report and will he comment on it?  Will he also comment on Ireland&rsquo;s proposed role as the framework nation in KFOR?</P>
        <P>The Minister may also wish to comment on calls made for him to sign up.  I do not refer to signing up in the Defence Forces but in response to his excellent presentation on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1472"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe the Minister will give us a verse. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise on these questions.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on his performance. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland currently has 826 troops serving overseas.  This figure consists of 168 officers and 658 non-officers.  I understand five doctors are currently deployed overseas.  While I do not have figures on the number of dentists, I understand none is serving overseas.  The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on whether we are having difficulty recruiting a sufficient number of doctors is an unequivocal &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I will deal with this matter in some detail in a later question.  </P>
        <P>On Sweden&rsquo;s reported reservations about Ireland&rsquo;s triple lock requirement, I read the report and do not agree with it.  I have not received queries from Sweden in this regard and, in any case, they would not matter because we must operate the triple lock mechanism under the law which states we cannot deploy personnel abroad without it.</P>
        <P>On acting as framework nation in Kosovo from August 2007, this new responsibility will contribute significantly to the development of the Defence Forces, improving their capability and heightening their profile as a professional, well organised force in the international peacekeeping community.  This is the reason Ireland will assume <Col N="1473"/>the role, which will require the deployment of an additional 50 to 60 personnel for a short period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the memorandum of understanding between the members of the Nordic battle group, is it not the case that it does not include a reference to Ireland&rsquo;s requirement for a triple lock or UN mandate?  Will the Minister lodge a copy of this document in the Oireachtas Library?  Will he arrange for a discussion on it given that it has far-reaching consequences?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I have consulted my officials about making the document available and will be pleased to do so if there are no barriers to publication.  A memorandum of understanding would not usually refer to the requirements of contributing members.  It simply outlines details of how the various contingents will operate together, who will perform what function etc.  It is not supposed to refer to the legal, political or other requirements for participation.  Sweden is the framework nation of the Nordic battle group and the Swedish Government has known throughout the process that Ireland has a triple lock requirement.  I have advised it of this matter and it accepts that the law here states that troops cannot be deployed on a UN peacekeeping mission without each of the three requirements of the triple lock mechanism being met.</P>
        <P>The Nordic battle group will be on stand-by for the first six months of 2008.  If the European Union were to decide in February or March 2008 to deploy the Nordic battle group, in which we have an explosives contingent consisting of 80 to 100 troops, the legal position would be that Ireland would not be able to deploy troops if each of the three triple lock requirements were not met.  That position will continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister referred to difficulties experienced in filling positions for overseas appointments.  Does he agree that the problem would be alleviated if the Reserve Defence Force were allowed to serve overseas?  Will he indicate when they will be permitted to serve abroad?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that if the reserve Defence Forces, particularly doctors, engineers and other professionals, were to serve overseas, it would significantly alleviate the problem.  Various difficulties are encountered in trying to get release from employment and these require deals to be done with IBEC etc.  The target set down in the White Paper was to have reserve Defence Forces serving overseas by the end of 2009 when the period covered by the White Paper was coming to an end.  We are still on target to achieve this goal. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Deputy Callely&rsquo;s view on the Minister&rsquo;s performance.  As I told him the other day, he is being talked about positively in <Col N="1474"/>Tallaght.  He is better known in Tallaght than one of Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s colleagues.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Is he better known than the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Deputy O&rsquo;Connor to ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor looks after internal matters. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>We have discussed at length the contingents that have served abroad.  Constituents of mine have pointed out that when Irish troops serve abroad they get involved in charity and community works.  Does this impact on the Minister&rsquo;s office?  Can he provide assistance in this regard?</P>
        <P>During the week, I was asked by someone from Templeogue to explain the reason the Department and Defence Forces do not use the expertise of those who have served abroad.  The first contingent of troops went to Lebanon in 1978.  This former soldier asked me why the expertise that is still available is not being used by the Army to assist those going abroad on these dangerous missions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The expertise is available.  Of the 826 personnel abroad currently, two thirds have been abroad previously, a considerable reserve of expertise.  I cannot remember the Deputy&rsquo;s first question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>When is the UN contingent being dispatched to Tallaght?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to know about the decommissioned bus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a serious question.  I am told by Army personnel who have been abroad that they are interested in getting involved in charitable and community work when they arrive.  Are there any plans to assist those who wish to do this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>They become involved with community and charitable work with local groups and people.  There have been instances in Kosovo and Monrovia where that happened and we give the Army every encouragement to continue with such work.  That is why the Army has such a great reputation in international peacekeeping circles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give the numbers of men and women who are serving abroad on the various UN missions?  Are the command areas evenly distributed?  Is there an overlap?  If someone goes to Kosovo, can he then go to Liberia on a further mission?</P>
        <P>What about the countries operating battle groups?  The memorandum of understanding does <Col N="1475"/>not include any specific references to the triple lock.  Would it be useful to review the situation so the memorandum includes a statement on our legislative requirements before deployment abroad on a mission?  Instead of advising Sweden and Finland on a personal basis, there should be a formal arrangement in the memorandum in writing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I am alarmed about the level of medical support for the large number of troops serving overseas.  There are five doctors but not a single dentist.  What arrangements exist for those who require dental treatment while overseas?  The Minister did not answer the question about paramedics involved in overseas missions.  I could make some positive suggestions on incentives we could put in place to encourage the medical professions, doctors and dentists, to participate in our overseas missions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The breakdown between men and women reflects the general numbers of women in the Army.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Around 5%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is in that order but I will get exact figures for the Deputy.  There is no barrier to prevent a person who goes to Liberia from then going to Lebanon or Kosovo.  There is an overlap.</P>
        <P>I see no reason why the memorandum of understanding should require a reference to the triple lock because the triple lock is the law and that takes precedence over any memorandum.</P>
        <P>I am sorry we did not get on to Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s question about sick leave but we are now providing incentives to recruit more doctors and dentists into the Army to provide frontline services.  We are also providing for more tracking of people who have received treatment through computerisation, even when we must bring in civilian doctors to treat them.</P>
        <P>On dentistry, Lebanon, for example, is a joint Irish-Finnish operation so there are medics from both countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Dentistry would be cheaper in Finland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>There are facilities for all medical and dental ailments and the same applies in all overseas missions, the expertise is available.  If Deputy Callely has any other incentives we could offer to recruit doctors and dentists, because we badly need to do this to provide frontline services instead of bringing GPs in from outside, I would be delighted to hear them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his courtesy in this matter.  It is important that backbenchers get the opportunity to raise these issues.  I will talk about Dublin South-West, and I invite Deputy Gormley to come to Tallaght with the Green Party candidate and I will be happy to show her around.</P>
        <P>In Dublin South-West we do not just talk about Tallaght, we also talk about Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills, Brittas and Bohernabreena.  It is important to recognise the huge population in that area and that the Department and the Minister take account of the need for the further development of hospital and community health services in the area.  There has been much progress in recent times, with positive developments under successive health boards on community facilities.  We have a tremendous health centre in Jobstown and GP centres in Killinarden and Brookfield.  The Millbrook Lawns health centre, however, still needs to be redeveloped after it was damaged by a fire seven years ago.  I have continued to badger the HSE on the need to start work now on that project.</P>
        <P>No discussion on the future of hospital and community services in south-west Dublin could ignore the situation in Tallaght Hospital.  I acknowledge the interest the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has shown in this subject.  The Ceann Comhairle was one of the Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers for Health who drove that project and who was kind enough to appoint me to the board in 1988.  I took a particular interest in the campaign and I was involved in AMANCH board set <Col N="1477"/>up in 1988 to move the Adelaide, Meath and National Children&rsquo;s Hospital to Tallaght.  The National Children&rsquo;s Hospital is the focus of a lot of attention throughout the Dublin region, particularly in the Tallaght area.</P>
        <P>We need information.  The HSE has reached a decision and there has been much talk about the process it went through and the surprise throughout Dublin, particularly in Tallaght, about Tallaght Hospital not figuring in the final decision.  It maintains that all nine criteria were fulfilled and there is scepticism about the decision even among medical professionals.</P>
        <P>We must now move on.  As someone who has been involved in the project and who lives within the shadow of Tallaght Hospital, we must be told by the Department and the HSE what is happening.  The future for the delivery of children&rsquo;s hospital services in the Tallaght region must be spelled out.  We do not know what is going on and there have been protests and community activism as a result.  This is the third largest population centre in the country so people need to know what is happening.  There is a huge youth population in Tallaght, with many young families and we must be clear following the decision on the Mater Hospital site about what will happen to children&rsquo;s services in Tallaght Hospital.</P>
        <P>My position is clear, children&rsquo;s services must be retained in Tallaght.  In fact further development is also an issue.  I hope the Minister of State will give us some insight in that regard.  I am happy to join with my colleague, Deputy Crowe, in raising this matter which is a very important one for my community and me personally.  I feel very strongly about my local hospital.  Not only am I a local representative, I am a campaigner for the services in that area.  I have been a patient in the hospital, and it is important that the Department understands that people in Tallaght need to know the answer.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating both Deputy Crowe and myself.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s positive reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to reiterate what my colleague has stated about the uncertainty existing in Tallaght at the moment.  I have lived in Tallaght for the past 18 years and I worked on the ground prior to that.  I have seen Ministers come and go on the Tallaght Hospital issue.  I do not know how many sod turnings we saw, with different Ministers coming from different Governments.  We eventually had the hospital opened, from which day it has been dogged by controversy.</P>
        <P>This is the latest fear and scare for the local people.  A month ago, between 3,500 and 4,000 people marched on the streets of Tallaght.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Including us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>They were trying to draw attention to the problem which exists.  They are afraid and frightened not only for themselves, but for their <Col N="1478"/>children and the communities they represent.  We have had different messages coming from Government.  One Deputy has stated there is no threat to services, but another Deputy is unsure.</P>
        <P>What will happen to the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Tallaght?  Last year, 67,221 patients went through the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, such is its scale.  We can discuss the movement to the Mater Hospital.  I surveyed the time it takes to go to the Mater Hospital from Tallaght Hospital.  It took me an hour and a half to get there.  A colleague, one of our local councillors, managed to get there in less than an hour by car but not in peak-time traffic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If between 3,500 and 4,000 people marched on the streets on a Saturday, this must be motivating people.  Tallaght is one of the most densely populated areas on the island, and it has the most rapidly growing population.  It has the largest proportion of people of child-bearing age and young people.  Yet we have the real prospect of losing a vital paediatric service from the area.  It is being conveniently moved to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency, but that is a discussion for another day.</P>
        <P>We are interested in what is in the best interests of children in the area we represent.  That is what the issue is about.  We are more interested in seeing a positive conclusion to this, and we want to know what will be the future of the hospital.  Will the Minister provide that answer?  It does not appear possible to give the answer through parliamentary questions or otherwise.  In that vacuum, people&rsquo;s fears are growing.  The experiment of travelling from Tallaght to the Mater Hospital highlighted a number of issues including the traffic problem.  It also highlights a danger for families with extremely sick children.  A number of people I know have had children with meningitis, for example, and the hospital being on their doorstep saved the children&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>This will certainly be an election issue, although we are not looking for an answer because of that.  We need those answers for the people living in that area to cut across all the uncertainty and worry that is out there, particularly for families.  At a public meeting, a member of the board told people the hospital was closed, and if a child gets a sore throat, he or she would have to got the Mater Hospital.  I do not know if that is the case, but we are entitled to answers.</P>
        <P>Instead of the population decreasing as it is in other parts of the city, Tallaght&rsquo;s population is expanding.  The other worry with regard to south-side services relates to the facilities in Crumlin.  Consultants there have stated they were not consulted on this closure.  There is a worry of whether there is enough space in the Mater Hospital and if there will be services for families to stay overnight and so on.</P>
        <P>As anyone in Dublin knows, it is easier to get out of the city centre than it is to get in.  If a person has a sick child on the outskirts of the city, the worry is how to get into the city centre.  If a <Col N="1479"/>person does not have access to a helicopter or a private car, that person relies on public transport.  We know how clogged up the roads are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies O&rsquo;Connor and Crowe for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am making this reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The Minister is aware of the specific concerns which have been expressed regarding the future development of services at Tallaght Hospital, which operates within the catchment area of Dublin South-West.  These concerns have largely centred on the position with regard to the provision of paediatric hospital services at Tallaght.</P>
        <P>Following the Government decision on the location of the new national paediatric hospital, the Taoiseach, the Minister and the chief executive officer of the HSE met with representatives of Tallaght Hospital, including Archbishop Eames, to discuss the implications of the decision for the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght.  A number of matters relating to the provision of adult services at Tallaght were also discussed.  Development proposals submitted by the delegation in this regard have been forwarded to the HSE for consideration.</P>
        <P>In a letter to the Archbishop following the meeting, the Taoiseach gave an assurance that the Government wishes to see Tallaght Hospital thrive on a sustainable basis as a particular focal point for the involvement of the minority tradition in the health care system and as a key health provider to an expanding local population.  These objectives will be pursued in tandem with other compelling objectives, including the achievement of an effective and efficient hospital care system, which will deliver the highest possible standards of care within a framework designed to respond to the needs of patients at national, regional and local level.</P>
        <P>A joint HSE and Department of Health and Children transition group has been established to advance the development of the national tertiary paediatric hospital.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new hospital and the determination of the range of services and location of the associated urgent care centres.</P>
        <P>We are trying to do the best for all our children, both in Tallaght and Dublin as a whole.  The current arrangements for the provision of hospital services for children in the Dublin and national area are not satisfactory.  On a sustainable basis, there is only room for one national tertiary hospital centre in this country.  Deputies have obligations to patient safety, and they have an obligation to advise the public about dangers to patient safety when such exist.</P><Col N="1480"/>
        <P>What is being attempted by the HSE, through a transparent process, is the establishment of a location for the national tertiary hospital for paediatric services.  All the hospitals in the Dublin area, including Tallaght Hospital, participated in that process.  Their participation in that process indicated a willingness to be bound by a decision.  A decision was arrived at, which had to happen.  There was not room for two or three paediatric tertiary hospitals in Dublin, as that is the unsatisfactory arrangement we have currently.  That is the issue that required to be addressed.</P>
        <P>However, the group will have consultations with relevant stakeholders, which will include representatives of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght.  I would like to salute the work done at that hospital, and the staff who work there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are clearly relevant stakeholders who will be consulted on the whole issue of the determination of the range of services, and the location of the associated urgent care centres.</P>
        <P>To date, no decision has been taken on the range of services to be provided at the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght in the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and the associated urgent care centres.  I understand the transition group is currently in the process of contracting external assistance on the preparation of the high level framework brief for the new hospital, which will include recommendations on the number and functional content of the urgent care centres required to support the new hospital.  The strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of the new primary care teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community-based health services in these areas.</P>
        <P>The HSE received additional revenue funding of &euro;16 million in 2006 to support further implementation of the strategy.  This represents a significant increase over previous years and brings the total ongoing funding to &euro;28 million per annum.</P>
        <P>Out of the &euro;16 million provided, &euro;10 million has been earmarked to establish up to 100 primary care teams, composed of 300 additional front line professionals.  Altogether, this will ensure integrated, accessible services for the populations served by these teams.  The funding is being targeted by the HSE to provide the potential for each local health office, formerly <Col N="1481"/>community care areas, to establish up to three primary care teams.  The HSE is currently in the process of finalising arrangements for the establishment of the primary care teams in 2006.  Further funding of &euro;10 million is being provided in 2007 to enable the full year cost of these developments to be met.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Out-of-hours co-operatives allow general practitioners to put in place arrangements to provide services to their patients while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, on weekends and bank holidays.  The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, the needs are met in the primary care setting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Co-operative arrangements involving approximately 250 general practitioners are already in place, serving a substantial proportion of the population on the south side of Dublin.  I understand that work is under way on the development of a specific GP out-of-hours service for the Tallaght and Clondalkin areas.  The HSE will also consider what other developments may be required to ensure people living across south Dublin have access to appropriate GP out-of-hours services, seven days a week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate that both Deputies are most anxious to raise the question of the future of what is colloquially described as Tallaght Hospital.  I know this because Deputy O&rsquo;Connor has raised this question with me on numerous occasions and Deputy Crowe raised the question in the House this evening.  I focused in my reply on the obligation of Deputies in respect of matters of patient safety.  I should have been more precise and refined.  I am actually talking about patient outcomes, not patient safety.  Safety and the treatment of patients in Tallaght are of a very high standard but there is a question about how we achieve the best outcomes for our children in terms of the configuration of the hospital system in Dublin.  This was the subject of the report.  It is clear from the reply I have made on behalf of the Minister that she is willing to engage with all relevant stakeholders including the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about the recent announcement made by the HSE and the Minister for Health and Children, regarding the provision of a six-slice CT scanner for Ennis General Hospital.  The widely-held view among medical practitioners is that the imaging quality of such a CT scanner is inadequate as a modern diagnostic tool.  The Department of Health and Children should immediately instruct the HSE to purchase a higher grade CT scanner.</P>
        <P>I recently called on Clare voters to be extra vigilant over Government assurances on the county&rsquo;s health services in the run-up to the election and there is nothing about this latest <Col N="1482"/>announcement on the CT scanner that makes me change my mind.</P>
        <P>I have spoken to consultants on this matter and they have assured me that anything less than a 16-slice scanner is yesterday&rsquo;s technology being applied to tomorrow&rsquo;s health services.  The population of Ennis and County Clare is growing and is currently more than 106,000.  The first prototype 16-slice scanner was apparently introduced in 2001 and 64-slice scanners are now common.  In proposing a six-slice scanner for Ennis General Hospital the Minister is seeking to install pre-2001 technology.  This does not seem like very old technology but this is one area that is subject to rapid technological developments.</P>
        <P>Since I tabled this motion I have been made aware that there is a doubt about whether there is such a thing as a six-slice scanner and that, in effect, the Minister is sanctioning a fictitious piece of equipment for Ennis General Hospital.</P>
        <P>I remind the House of her reply to me last week.  After much toing and froing between my office and her Department over whether she would approve the revenue costs to operate a CT scanner in Ennis &mdash; an answer to which I am still awaiting &mdash; she stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">the Hospital has been given approval by the HSE to purchase a six-slice CT scanner.  The HSE is currently considering the revenue requirement for the new scanner.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The HSE informed me on 12 October that they were awaiting funding to proceed.  I ask the Minister of State the reason Ennis should be given a six-slice scanner when Ballinasloe&rsquo;s Portiuncula Hospital is getting a 64-slice scanner and Nenagh General Hospital a 16-slice scanner.  Why is something inferior marked down for Ennis?  Why is Ennis the poor relation of these hospitals when &euro;600,000 has been awarded by the mid-western hospital development trust for a scanner?</P>
        <P>In case she is in any doubt about the value for money that can now be had for 16-slice scanners, I wish to inform the Minister that a Siemens Emotion 16 scanner has a high diagnostic image quality and, according to <i>Medical Technology Business Europe</i> newsletter, &ldquo;enables hospitals and private practices with limited budgets or space allocations to install a 16-slice computed tomography (CT) scanner suitable for comprehensive clinical applications&rdquo;.  That is all we want for Ennis.  It would fit into a space of less than 200 sq. ft. and I believe the purchase price would not be much more than what the hospital has received from the trust fund.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State as the representative of the Minister for Health and Children to put pressure on the Minister to take into account a technology which is changing rapidly.  The consultants advise that a 16-slice scanner is the minimum needed for Ennis and not a six-slice scanner.</P><Col N="1483"/>
        <P>My party leader was in Ennis last week and he visited Ennis General Hospital.  He was told this information by the consultants.  He also gave a commitment that a consultant-led 24 hour accident and emergency service would continue in Ennis General Hospital under his leadership.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will have positive news for me this evening and that the Department will consider this proposal in the interests of patient safety and in the interests of promoting Ennis General Hospital where it is still awaiting the development plan to be implemented.  A sum of &euro;30 million has been allocated for this purpose but not a brick has been laid yet.  We are hoping for good news in the near future.  The recent news about the scanner does not bode well for a positive outlook for the future of the hospital and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Pat Breen for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am making this reply on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of services at Ennis General Hospital is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>With regard to the CT scanner, the Health Service Executive has informed the Department that the<b> </b>mid-west hospitals trust has agreed to provide funds towards the purchase and installation of a CT scanner at Ennis General Hospital.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has carried out a review of the CT scanner requirement.  The number of CT procedures continues to grow in Ireland year on year.  The hospital has been given approval by the HSE to purchase a six-slice CT scanner.  The HSE is currently considering the revenue requirement for the new scanner and the cost of operating the scanner on a current basis.</P>
        <P>People from County Clare currently have to travel to Limerick or Galway for a CT scan.  The provision of CT scanning facilities at Ennis General Hospital will mean people from County Clare can receive CT scans in Ennis.  The new CT scan will also have a significant effect on the workload of the regional hospitals.  It must be noted that the more commonly required CT scans account for close to all of the scans required in county hospitals.</P>
        <P>Common CT examinations such as pelvic and abdominal, brain, head and neck, chest and spine studies account for most of the CT procedures required.  The use of multi-slice CT scanning for specialty procedures, such as vascular and cardiac CT procedures, made up less than 5% of the total number of CTs performed internationally and exclusively in large tertiary hospitals.  The Health Service Executive envisages that multi-slice 64-slice scanners will be installed in the major teaching and regional hospitals to facilitate specialty scanning, particularly in the area of cardiology.</P><Col N="1484"/>
        <P>In the past year the Health Service Executive has taken the approach that CT scanning be available in its general hospitals to provide the more commonly ordered CT scans and studies locally and relieve the demand on the tertiary centres.  In 2005, the Health Service Executive gave approval to proceed with the installation of six-slice CT scanners at a number of hospitals.</P>
        <P>Costs rise significantly as the number of slices increase.  In addition the six-slice scanner is considerably more robust than the higher slice capacity units resulting in less down time.   For the type of scans being carried out, it is a more efficient scanner.</P>
        <P>In addition to the provision of a new CT scanner in Ennis, a major new development at the hospital is at planning stage.  A project team was set up to identify priority developments at the hospital so that the long-term requirements of the county can be addressed.  The priority areas for development in phase 1A include the upgrade of wards, the accident and emergency department, the radiology department, including the CT scanner, the outpatients department, the intensive care unit, the concourse and a general infrastructure upgrade.  These developments will cost more than &euro;30 million to design, build and equip.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has recently issued approval to progress the design of the project to stage three, subject to the functional content of the planning brief being reviewed following the outcome of the review of the acute hospital services in the mid-west.</P>
        <P>The Government is investing capital funding of more than &euro;550 million on 400 individual health projects this year and more will be invested in 2007.  We are committed to developing county hospitals such as Ennis to provide appropriate services for the people in County Clare.  The Minister&rsquo;s policy is to provide safe, high quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.  This will mean that those services that can be safely delivered locally are delivered locally.  More complex services that require specialist input are concentrated in regional or national centres of excellence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  This is Science Week Ireland and it should not go unobserved in the D&aacute;il.  One of the most interesting aspects of budget 2006 was the announcement of the strategic innovation fund for fourth level education.  Investment in intellectual capital has been a hallmark of our economic prosperity and has brought us to where we are today.  The establishment of the strategic initiative fund is a clear expression on the part of Government of the important role it plays in the process of learning, learning at the pinnacle of inquiry.  This is investment at the cutting edge, the research and development sector.</P><Col N="1485"/>
        <P>Complacency is the single biggest threat facing our economy.  External forces of change have required us to surmount ever higher hurdles to sustain success.  Our economy has moved from a low cost one to one where added value is now a necessity.  While we continue to generate more jobs than can be filled, the type of job has changed significantly from those in the manufacturing sector to those supporting Ireland&rsquo;s knowledge economy.  The basis for future growth and prosperity is investment in that knowledge economy.  The strategic innovation fund is a sound bedrock to underpin this goal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Exploration, innovation and inquiry are the essence of science.  The enterprise strategy group report, Ahead of the Curve, clearly identifies that this is where our competitive advantage and future lie.  It is in the schools and science labs of today that the foundation of Ireland&rsquo;s future economic success is built.  Government has shown leadership, but there is more to do.  We must support an environment which facilitates collaboration between enterprise and academia.  Internationally, public support for business sector research and development has moved strongly towards co-operative research.  The institutes of technology are very well placed to support innovative enterprise through technical consulting and collaboration on close-to-market research projects.  In my constituency, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art and Design is particularly proactive on this front.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Climate change offers Ireland limitless opportunities in finding solutions to the challenges it presents.  Research in biofuels and alternative renewable energies are areas where Ireland could be a world leader given our geographic location which provides optimum conditions for wind turbines and the growth of biomass.  These are areas where scientific inquiry is at an early stage and I have often said we could be the global research and development capital of renewable energies.  This is an ambition which the strategic innovation fund could help Ireland realise.</P>
        <P>While it is understandable that responsibility for science currently resides in the Department of Education and Science, there is an argument for transferring this responsibility in the next administration into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Given the strategic change in direction which Ireland is required to make to keep the economy progressing, this is an idea worth considering.  Given the obvious role science will play at the heart of this new strategy, in addition to the importance of fostering our entrepreneurial spirit, a base in our Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment would make most sense.</P>
        <P>Science will be the fulcrum of Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth, investment in science today means a strong economy tomorrow.  As politicians that is what we should be providing for future generations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am taking this adjournment on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Martin, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>Science Week Ireland is the celebration and demonstration of science, engineering and technology in Ireland.  People of all ages are given the opportunity and encouraged to explore, discover, experiment or invent their way to a better understanding of Irish innovation and its relevance to Ireland&rsquo;s economic prosperity through hundreds of events held nationwide.</P>
        <P>This marks the tenth year of Science Week Ireland and this year the theme is science in our future. It is examining emerging technologies, the latest movements in science and engineering and also predictions as to what science might uncover in the future.  Science Week Ireland highlights that the science, engineering and technology industry and education sector develops cutting edge innovations and provide skilled jobs.  It contributes hugely to the Irish economy and is relevant to us all in our everyday lives, often in surprising ways.  It leads to exciting career options and develops creativity in our children.</P>
        <P>Science Week Ireland is running from 12 to 19 November 2006 and it is a key event in the calendar of the discover science and engineering awareness programme.  This year it will be bigger than ever and there has been a strong response from all the partners throughout the country with over 370 events taking place nationwide.  For example, in the Minister&rsquo;s native Cork more than 7,000 people are expected to visit the Discovery 06 event centred in Cork City Hall where there will be over 50 exhibits and workshops.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The awareness of science, which this week promotes, is critically important given that the development of the knowledge-based economy is one of the key challenges and opportunities facing Ireland.  Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley put that very well in her contribution.  We know that the factors which have contributed to our economic success will not be sufficient to sustain our recent achievements.  Increasing international competition is creating pressure for improvements in efficiency, quality and productivity and a growing need for innovation.  These pressures will increase and intensify.  It will require courageous, forward-looking steps to achieve real strategic change, show tangible medium-term results and shape the future.</P>
        <P>The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, SSTI, is a whole Government approach which addresses these very demanding challenges.  This strategy was launched by Government on 18 June 2006 and constitutes one of the principal pillars of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  It strives towards a vision by 2013 of an Ireland internationally renowned for the excellence of its research and at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for <Col N="1487"/>economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture.</P>
        <P>The strategy will see additional investment of &euro;3.854 billion over the period 2006 to 2013.  It will move Ireland forward significantly in areas such as the output of PhDs, Government expenditure on research and development and business expenditure on research and development.  The strategy provides for the continued development of a world-class research system underpinned by the essential physical and human infrastructure, almost doubling the number of PhD graduates over its lifespan.  Top level researchers will be drawn both from home-grown talent and the brightest that can be attracted from overseas.</P>
        <P>The strategy proposes mechanisms to ensure that the investment in research is turned into commercial value to the greatest extent possible.  In regard to enterprise, the strategy sets out structures and mechanisms to enhance supports to industry and encourage firms to become more engaged in research and development.  Detailed targets are set for this, encapsulated in the goal of increasing business expenditure on research and development from the current level of &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;2.5 billion by 2013.</P>
        <P>The strategy has significant implications for the education system as a whole, with curriculum and <Col N="1488"/>teacher training improvements focused on ensuring that science is a core element for all students from school entry right through to eventual career choice.  A broad agenda is set out in the strategy for public sector research across all key research performing departments.  This research will yield important social and economic benefits across areas such as agriculture and food, marine, health, environment and energy.</P>
        <P>Under the strategy it is proposed to upscale research across all disciplines, both the physical sciences and the humanities and social sciences.  This approach is founded in a belief in the intrinsic value of scholarship, to democratic society and to the work of universities as communities of knowledge and discourse.  In addition, there are compelling social and economic reasons to further develop our capabilities in the humanities and social sciences.  We must understand the rapid changes taking place in the Irish economy and society as these can help inform a better approach to public policy and decisions.  We must also create creative and analytical skills in the context of the global economy, which is increasingly dominated by knowledge industries.</P>

	<P>On 2 February, 2006, I received a report from Mr. Sean <Col N="1490"/>Hurley, who I had appointed to carry out an independent review of the interaction between the Department of Defence/Defence Forces and parents and family of Private Kevin Barrett in the aftermath of his tragic death, on 18 February, 1999, while serving with the 84th Infantry Battalion in Lebanon.  Mr. Hurley looked in detail at how the Department and the Defence Forces interacted with the Barrett family after Kevin&rsquo;s death and has identified some clear failings and shortcomings.</P>
        <P>Immediately on receipt of Mr. Hurley&rsquo;s report, I contacted the Garda Commissioner and asked him to provide me with his early views in relation to any possible assistance that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might be in a position to provide.  The Garda officer assigned to the case is continuing to examine my Department&rsquo;s and the Defence Forces files in the case, with a view to determining whether the Garda&iacute; can provide any assistance in the matter. Liaison arrangements have been set up between the Garda&iacute; and the Defence Forces, who continue to provide the fullest co-operation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To date the Defence Forces have assisted in providing access to the considerable number of witnesses associated with the case and have also facilitated the visit by the investigation team to Lebanon and Israel. The weapon that fired the fatal shot has been handed over by the Defence Forces to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for tests. At the request of the Garda&iacute;, the Defence Forces also arranged, with the agreement of the UN, for the return to Ireland of the billet in which Pte. Barrett died.  The billet has been the subject of detailed forensic examination by the Garda&iacute;.  The Garda inquiries are still ongoing and when completed, I expect the Commissioner will contact me in the matter.  My understanding is that the Garda investigation may be completed towards the end of this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 33 together.</P>
        <P>Sick leave in the Defence Forces was about 14 days per annum per person in the period from October 2005 to 30 September 2006. A SFA report earlier this year identified an average of 10 days absence per person per annum in larger firms.</P>
        <P>Military service, due to the robust nature of the physical training regime exposes personnel to a unique range of challenging environments with attendant health risks. The mission of the Medical Corps of the Defence Forces is to ensure and to co-ordinate the provision of medical, dental and pharmaceutical support to the Defence Forces in the execution of their Roles as assigned by Government. Military medical services and their facilities exist to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities.</P>
        <P>There is a shortage of medical officers (Doctors) in the Medical Corps. The establishment for Medical Officers is 47 and the current strength if 23, of whom 12 are functioning in front line clinical duties in Ireland amongst Brigades and formations. The services of civilian medical practitioners are regularly engaged to ensure that the primary health care requirements arising in barracks are met. However, the shortage of dedicated doctors impacts on overall management and control, both at the level of local units and nationally in the Medical Corps.</P>
        <P>Efforts are ongoing to address the shortage of Medical Officers (Doctors) in the Medical Corps. A recruitment campaign for Doctors is currently underway.  This campaign follows on from a recent decision to significantly increase the pay of Doctors and Dentists in the Medical Corps, linking them to the pay of public health doctors and dentists.</P>
        <P>A review of the provision of medical services in the Defence Forces initiated as part of the Modernisation Agenda under Sustaining Progress has delivered improvements in this area. This work involves the Department of Defence including military management and the Representative Associations. A revised concept document on the <Col N="1492"/>provision of medical services and a patients charter are being prepared. There will be a greater emphasis on the direct provision of medical services and improvements in the maintenance and tracking of patients&rsquo; records and treatment through computerisation. In the context of the Modernisation agenda arising under &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; it is also intended to review the sick leave arrangements for personnel of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The work outlined above will assist the Chief of Staff, the Medical Corps and local commanders in their efforts to minimise the instances of sick leave of the Defence Forces and to maintain the general health of the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P>The sale of a site comprising c. 2.7 acres to the Southern Health Board at the former Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, Co. Cork  for &euro;1.73 million was completed in December 2004.  19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, were sold to Cork County Council in 2001 for &euro;0.974 million for development in conjunction with the IDA.  10 acres at Ringaskiddy was transferred from my Department to the Department of Education and Science in 2002 as a site for the National Maritime College. There was no transfer of funds involved as the lands were made available as my Department&rsquo;s contribution to the project.  Castleblayney Military Post, Co. Monaghan, comprising c. 10 acres, was sold to the North Eastern Health Board for &euro;0.762 million in 2002.  7 acres at Devoy Barracks, Naas, Co. Kildare, were ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for &euro;8.888 million.  The balance of the Barracks lands &mdash; one acre &mdash; was sold to Kildare County Council for &euro;0.381 million in 2002.</P>
        <P>Lands comprising 6.39 acres, known as &ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s Field&rdquo;, adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork, were sold to Cork City Council for &euro;1.523 million in 2002.  Circa 3.4 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, was disposed of to Limerick City Council for &euro;1.162 million in 2002/2003.  A site comprising circa 0.931 acre, adjacent to my Department&rsquo;s RDF premises in Kanturk, Co. Cork, was disposed of to the Southern Health Board for a consideration of &euro;0.178 million in 2003.  Approximately 1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks was sold to Waterford City Council for &euro;0.662 million in 2003.  Spike Island, Co. Cork, was sold to the Department of Justice on foot of a nominal fund exchange of &euro;0.065 million in 2004.  In 2005, my Department&rsquo;s RDF premises in Killorglin was transferred to Kerry County Council for inclusion in a major town development project. In exchange, the County Council provided a new purpose built RDF premises on a nearby site owned by the Council and in addition, made a balancing payment of &euro;0.012 million to <Col N="1494"/>reflect the full value of the original RDF property.</P>
        <P>The water supply system and ancillary lands at Knockalisheen Camp were sold to Clare County Council earlier this year for &euro;0.026 million.</P>
        <P>The Government agreed on 16 December 2003 to the release of circa 2.5 acres at St. Bricin&rsquo;s Military Hospital, Dublin for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative. The site was recently transferred to Dublin City Council as specified by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for a nominal consideration.</P>
        <P>In addition, from time to time land at various locations has been dedicated to local authorities to allow for projects such as road widening or realignment schemes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>An informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers took place in Levi, Finland on 2nd and 3rd October, 2006.  In tandem with the informal Defence Ministers&rsquo; meeting, there was a Ministerial level meeting of the EDA Steering Board.</P>
        <P>The main item on the Agenda for the Steering Board was a discussion on the EDA&rsquo;s initial long-term vision, which had been developed by the Agency over the past number of months.  The purpose of the LTV is to set out a view of the future global context and, against this background, the potential capability requirements for ESDP operations.  Given the lead time involved in the development of defence equipment and capabilities, there is a need to project forward over a 20 to 30 year time horizon so as to provide some guidance to the EDA and capability planners in terms of the broad types of capabilities which ESDP is likely to require in the future.</P>
        <P>The overall thrust of the LTV document was generally supported by the Steering Board as providing a broad compass looking into the future of possible capability needs for EU military forces engaged in ESDP operations.  That said there are significant caveats on the document which is an a-political, non-binding, non-committing document which has not been agreed in word-by-word detail by the member States.</P>
        <P>The long-term vision is a living document to be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis, probably every 2 to 3 years.  It will provide some guid<Col N="1495"/>ance on the focus of R&amp;T initiatives which may be facilitated by the EDA and will feed into an ESDP Capability Development Plan to be completed by December.  Any future R&amp;T Agenda or Capability Development Plans will have to be agreed specifically by the Steering board on a case-by-case basis.</P>

        <P>Haulbowline Island comprises approximately 84 acres in total and is, in its entirety, vested in the Minister for Finance.  The area of the Island formerly under Lease to Irish Ispat (previously Irish Steel), and now under the administration of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government arising from the liquidation of that Company, covers c. 44 acres.  My Department administers the balance of the Island lands, which are occupied by the Naval Service.  None of the lands on Haulbowline Island are in private ownership, however, Rocky Island, which lies between Haulbowline Island and the mainland at Ringaskiddy, was sold by the liquidator of Irish Ispat to a private individual in 2005.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has lead responsibility for the remediation of the Ispat site.  In that regard, my  Department has signalled Naval Service interests in the future use of the site.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made recently in implementing schemes to enable more commissioning from the ranks.  The revised cadetship competition is now seen as the primary means of commissioning from the ranks. The cadetship competition has been revised to increase the maximum entry age to 28 and to award bonus marks to candidates with previous experience in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) or Reserve Defence Force (RDF).  Results for the 2006 cadetship competition were encouraging with 13% of PDF and 8% of RDF applicants being successful in obtaining cadetships as against 4% of &ldquo;civilian&rdquo; candidates.</P>
        <P>Consultations with the representative associations are ongoing regarding the conditions for an internal Commissioning From the Ranks competition, which it is intended to hold in the coming months. This competition will provide an opportunity for enlisted personnel who have passed the cadet entry age to compete for entry on a potential Officers Course and ultimately, a commission.  The outcome of this competition will inform policy on the issue of similar future competitions.</P>

	<P>The acquisition of new equipment and services for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence.  Significant invest<Col N="1498"/>ment has taken place in recent years and I will continue the good work in that regard.</P>
        <P>The unprecedented level of expenditure on equipment for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service was made possible by the Government&rsquo;s decision that pay savings arising from the reorganization of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper of 2000, along with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment.</P>
        <P>Investment in new equipment for the Defence Forces and for the on-going support of that equipment, is provided for under various Subheads of the Defence Vote relating to defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, ships and naval stores, engineering, communications and Information Technology equipment etc. Details of the level of expenditure over the past 10 years in each of these areas are set out in the following tabular statement.</P><Col N="1497"/>

	<P>In 2005, a total of 64 Officers were newly commissioned and 441 Enlisted Personnel (including 49 Cadets) were newly inducted into the Defence Forces. The corresponding figures for 2006 to date are 67 Officers and 497 Enlisted Personnel (including 52 Cadets).</P>
        <P>The number of retirements for Officers and Enlisted Personnel is as set out in the following schedule.  Defence Force Regulations provide that a person who enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force before 1 January 1994 may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of sixty years. It also provides that a person who enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force on or after 1 January 1994 may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years in the rank of Sergeant and to the age of fifty-six in all higher ranks. Enlisted personnel, in the rank of corporal or private, who enlisted after 1 January 1994, may not serve beyond twenty-one years service in any event.</P><Col N="1499"/>
        <P>The current retirement ages are 54 for Captain, 56 for Commandant and 58 for Lieutenant Colonel. Higher ranks have retiring ages ranging from 60 to 63 years of age.</P>
        <P>The 2000 White Paper on Defence and the earlier Defence Force Review Implementation Plan both, in the context of a Defence Force Per<Col N="1500"/>sonnel Management System, recommended reduction to retirement ages and the introduction of short service commissions for some officers in the Defence Force. These measures were designed to address the shortage of junior officers, to improve the age profile of officers and to ensure mobility.</P><Col N="1499"/>

        <P>It has been the practice to permit occasional use of Casement Aerodrome by privately owned aircraft on an &ldquo;ad hoc&rdquo; basis on the payment of a fee and production of the necessary insurance indemnity.</P>
        <P>Requests for permission to land privately owned aircraft, including helicopters, at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, are occasionally received by my Department.

A fee of &euro;222.20 is payable in respect of each occasion of use.  Permission was granted for twenty six (26) such landings since January, 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 227.</P>
        <P>The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue Region. The Air Corps had been providing Search and Rescue (SAR) services in the North West but withdrew in October 2004 following a handover of this role to CHCI, a private operator, which also provides the service at the country&rsquo;s other SAR bases at Dublin, Shannon and Waterford. There is no plan to reconsider the decision to withdraw the Air Corps from the maritime Search and Rescue Service.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil authorities specifically in relation to Search and Rescue. In this regard, the Naval Service and the Air Corps will continue to provide support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capacity. Air Corps pilots will continue to train in search and rescue techniques and to provide a limited non-maritime search and rescue response. The specification for the new helicopters being acquired for the Air Corps includes a search and rescue capability.</P>
        <P>Search and rescue capability requires a wide range of available skills, such as piloting, winching, medical, vessel crewing and radar. I am advised by the military authorities that the availability of these skills within the Defence Forces is sufficient to meet their continuing commitments in this area.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force all ranks comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,444 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. There are no proposals to increase the strength of the Permanent Defence Force above the White Paper figure of 10,500.  Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the approved level.</P>

	<P>Defence Force Regulations provide that a person who enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force before 1 January 1994 may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of sixty years. A person who enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force on or <Col N="1502"/>after 1 January 1994 may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years in the rank of Sergeant and to the age of fifty-six in all higher ranks. Enlisted personnel, in the rank of corporal or private, who enlisted after 1 January 1994, may not serve beyond twenty-one years service in any event.</P>
        <P>Under the current contract system a person who enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994 is initially enlisted for a period of five years in the Permanent Defence Force, and a further seven years in the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
        <P>At the completion of the initial five-year period, the enlisted person may apply for an extension of service from five to nine years, and subsequently from nine to twelve years.</P>
        <P>On completion of twelve years service in the PDF, the individual may apply for re-engagement to complete twenty-one years PDF service. Following this, they may apply for continuance in service for two-year periods up to retirement age.</P>
        <P>Applications for extensions of service, re-engagement, and continuance are considered under a number of criteria, one of which is Military Courses completed. Under this criterion, personnel who enlisted after 1 January 1994 are required to have completed all courses that would be needed in order to qualify for promotion to the rank of sergeant, or be serving in that higher rank, in order to qualify for continuance in service after 21 years.</P>
        <P>Personnel who enlisted after 17 February 2006 are also required to have successfully completed all courses needed to qualify them for promotion to the rank of corporal for re-engagement. Alternatively, such personnel may be serving as technician grade 3 or higher to qualify for re-engagement.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s recently published White Paper on Irish Aid provides for the creation of Ireland&rsquo;s own specific operational capabilities in responding to humanitarian emergencies: the Rapid Response Initiative (RRI).</P>
        <P>The three main components of the initiative are the pre-positioning and transportation of material humanitarian supplies to disaster locations; the creation of a register of highly skilled and experienced individuals for deployment with international agencies at short notice; <Col N="1503"/>and an overall enhancement of our support to international humanitarian response agencies and mechanisms.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is working closely on this initiative with other Departments including my Department.  In this regard a number of meetings have been held between officials from my Department and from the Department of Foreign Affairs over the last year.  These meetings have focused on assistance my Department/Defence Forces may be able to provide in relation to the development of the RRI with particular reference to the first two pillars and considerable progress has been made.</P>
        <P>In relation specifically to the second element of this initiative &mdash; that is, the creation of a register of skilled and experienced individuals ready for rapid deployment &mdash; through working closely with my Department and others, the Department of Foreign Affairs believes that the initiative will enable the release of key skilled people to take part in emergency teams deployed to make rapid needs assessments and assist in the coordination of relief. It is hoped that Ireland can help bridge some of the gaps in certain key sectors in order to fill particular gaps in capacity in the international community&rsquo;s humanitarian response.</P>
        <P>In addition the White Paper on Irish Aid also provides for the establishment of a Volunteer Corps Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs to harness the strong volunteer spirit, which exists across the country in support of overseas development activities. I am informed by my colleague, Mr. Dermot Ahern, T.D., Minister for Foreign Affairs, that his Department is to open an Irish Aid Volunteering Centre in Dublin in early 2007.  This centre will provide information, support and advice to those wishing to volunteer.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 44 and 66 together.</P>
        <P>Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, Apprenticeship Competition, General Service Enlistment or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments.  All applicants for each of these entry streams are required to meet qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>The question of the recruitment of foreign-nationals to the Defence Forces is not a new one and Defence Force Regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of foreign-nationals to the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The operational requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces are not directly comparable.  My Department is not specifically targeting the recruitment of ethnic minorities for the Defence Forces at present.  Currently my emphasis is on ensuring that there are no barriers to ethnic minorities or foreign nationals joining the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>As you are aware, I have made changes to the Cadet competition to broaden the entry criteria thereby making it easier for qualifying foreign nationals to apply for cadetships.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Defence Forces Equality Policy underpins equality legislation and states that;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The Defence Forces are committed to the principles of equal opportunities in all employment policies, procedures and regulations.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The Defence Forces will operate in an environment without discrimination in areas as provided by the Equality Acts.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The Defence Forces will ensure that the principles of employment equality are employed in recruitment, promotion, training and work experience.</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />All regulations and Administrative Instructions concerning service in the Defence Forces shall be set out in a manner consistent with this policy of equal opportunity.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />This policy will be reviewed along with the Defence Force regulations on an ongoing basis by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) to ensure compliance with best practice and to maintain a working environment that treats all members of the Defence Forces in a manner consistent with equal opportunities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The primary focus in recruitment is to attract people with the core competencies required by the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Defence Forces are fully committed to ensuring that all (and that includes ethnic minorities and foreign-nationals) who wish to do so are given the opportunity to join the Defence Forces.  In terms of statistics, it is not the Defence Forces approach to categorise personnel by nationality or place of birth.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 47 together.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.  It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing <Col N="1506"/>recruitment to the Defence Forces and the Defence Forces continue to have a proactive approach to all aspects of recruiting. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs.  The strength of the Defence Forces as at 31 December in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively was 10,498, 10,551 and 10,446.</P>
        <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 31 October 2006, as advised by the military authorities was 10,357. A detailed breakdown of the numbers in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by rank is in the form of a Tabular Statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
        <P>There is a planned total intake of 255 personnel (Cadets, Apprentices &amp; General Enlistment) before the end of 2006, with an expected outflow of 150 personnel in the same period.  Recruit intake will be finalised in December 2006 to ensure that the annualised monthly average strength is at or around 10,500.</P><Col N="1505"/>

	<P>The White Paper on Defence set the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 10,500.  It also provided that the Chief of Staff could maintain an additional 250 in training at any one time.

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 60, 70, 232 to 234, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>On 24 January 2006, the Government, in an informal decision, agreed that the Minister for Defence could enter into discussions with Sweden and other like-minded nations in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to EU Battle groups.  Representatives from the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces have met with their Swedish counterparts on a number of occasions to discuss possible participation by the Defence Forces in the Nordic Battle group.  Following discussions with Sweden, which is the framework nation for the Nordic Battle group, Sweden on behalf of the Nordic Battle group advised that it will welcome a contribution from Ireland, subject to Ireland&rsquo;s agreement to sign the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the Nordic Battle group, without amendment.  The MoU is an agreement between the participants comprising the Nordic Battle group, namely Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia, which sets out principles in relation the operation, deployment and management of the Nordic Battle group.</P>
        <P>At the Government meeting of 14 November, approval was given to provide a contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces to participate in the Nordic Battle group and for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to sign the MoU for the Nordic Battle group, subject to the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>The proposed Defence Forces contribution will involve an EOD/IEDD contingent with its own security detail, together with staff posts at the Operational and Force headquarters.  (EOD/IEDD means Explosive Ordnance Dis<Col N="1508"/>posal and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal.  EOD relates to normal type munitions whereas IEDD generally refers to devices devised by terrorist groups, such as car bombs etc.)  The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved is expected to be somewhere between 80 and 100.  This level of commitment will only arise should the Battle group be called on to undertake an operation.  The number of personnel involved operationally during the standby period, where the Battle group has not been mobilised to undertake an operation, will be of the order of 10 personnel.  Any contribution to a Battle group will be met within the context of the overall ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time set in the White Paper on Defence and will have no adverse impact on our existing peace support operations.</P>
        <P>Most Battle group training will take place in the contributing member States &mdash; i.e. Irish troops will mainly be trained in Ireland.  That said, some level of joint training with other Battle group elements will be required.  It is planned that joint training of the Nordic Battle group elements, including field manoeuvres, will take place in Sweden in September/October 2007 for a period of approximately 3 to 4 weeks.  Sweden, on behalf of the other participating States, has accepted that there will be no joint training exercises in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Irrespective of our participation in the Nordic Battle group in 2008, possible participation in future Battle groups with other EU partners is also under active consideration.  In this regard, it is proposed to have further discussions with other member States over the coming months, in particular, with Finland and Austria with whom we have had some initial informal exploratory discussions.</P>

	<P>The current rates of pay and allowances for members of the Defence Forces can be found on my Departments website at www.defence.ie. I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement setting out the details as requested.</P>
        <P>A wide range of different rates of pay for military personnel can be found across the European Union. This reflects the enormous differences in development levels and labour market conditions between member States. The differing rates are also influenced by such matters as the conditions of entry, terms of service, workloads, <Col N="1509"/>taskings, superannuation provisions and the taxation and social welfare regimes that apply in the various EU countries. In addition, the nature of national defence organisations themselves is quite varied.</P>
        <P>Rates of remuneration and conditions of employment in the Irish public sector are never set by reference to those obtaining in another EU member State. What is much more relevant is a comparison of the relative levels of pay across the various sectors of the Irish public sector and private sector.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the pay of Defence Forces personnel has benefited from national pay agreements and from benchmarking against the private sector. As you may be aware there is a benchmarking process currently underway with a report due in 2007.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There is a range of safety precautions in place designed to prevent injury to military or civilian personnel during a training exercise.  Prior to any training exercise a comprehensive risk assessment for each aspect of the exercise is carried out and all necessary precautions are taken to address each of the risks highlighted.  Each military firing range also has a set of range orders, which outline all required precautions that must be observed during a training event.  All personnel involved in the exercise are issued with appropriate protective equipment for the taskings included in the exercise.  Medical personnel and military police are also assigned as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Arrangements in regard to safeguarding members of the public during military training exercises include, where appropriate, the prior notification of a scheduled exercise to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the area and the local community in the immediate vicinity of the exercise.  Warning Signs are displayed on all major roads in the area and sentries are placed on approach roads to the exercise area.  Warning flags and flashing lights are also displayed to further indicate the presence of exercise troops in an area.  In certain cases notifications are advertised in the local and national press prior to the exercise taking place.</P>
        <P>The safety of personnel, both military and civilian, during Defence Forces training exercises is <Col N="1512"/>of paramount importance to the Department of Defence and safety precautions are kept under review in order to achieve that objective.</P>

	<P>The military authorities advise that at present the staff strength of the Military Archives is three (3), comprising of two (2) commissioned officers and one (1) Private.  The military authorities advise me that a strength of five (5), including suitably qualified replacements for two (2) officers who have retired and who previously also worked in the Archives, is sufficient to meet the current demands on the Military Archives. I appreciate the importance of returning to five (5) full-time equivalent staff in the military archives without delay.</P>
        <P>The requirement for a more suitable home for the Military Archives has been recognised for some time. The primary focus has so far been on the National Museum of Ireland facility at the former Collins Barracks Dublin, long considered <Col N="1513"/>as the most appropriate location for the Military Archives.</P>
        <P>Facilities are required to protect and safeguard the material currently stored and to provide for the deposition of future material, as well as permitting easy public access. An Inter Departmental Committee was established in early 2003 with terms of reference to examine and to advise on the best means of protecting and safeguarding the Military Archives by way of securing their removal from Cathal Brugha Barracks to new premises to be developed at the former Collins Barracks Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Inter Departmental Committee focussed on feasibility studies based on a detailed examination of various locations around and within the Collins Barracks site. These studies were carried out up to early 2005 by a firm of architectural consultants engaged through the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>The consultants identified potential locations within the Collins Barracks site. However, these feasibility studies also raised serious issues around the cost, planning and building/ architectural protection considerations involved in meeting the demands of the Military Archives on the Collins Barracks site. The implications of the serious questions raised about the location of the full Military Archives on this site are being examined in my Department.</P>
        <P>Particular challenges and difficulties in re-housing the Military Archives at Collins Barracks would be posed by the provision of extensive modern purpose-built facilities within the restrictions of an historic built environment. Consideration of some usage of the Collins Barracks site has not been exhausted. However, I have asked the Interdepartmental Committee to extend its search beyond Collins Barracks and to revert to me with options.  I have also requested that any scope for locating the Military Archives together with or alongside the National Archives continue to be explored in line with that body&rsquo;s own development plans.</P>

	<P>At the meeting of the European Defence Agency Steering Board on 21 November 2005, agreement was reached on the voluntary code of conduct, the aim of which is to encourage greater competition in the European Defence Market.  The voluntary Code of Conduct seeks to eliminate or reduce the level of recourse to Article 296 of the Treaty, which enables member States avoid the normal open tendering arrangements, where Defence Equipment is involved.  </P>
        <P>The Code of Conduct was introduced for subscribing Member States on 1 July 2006.  Of the 24 Member States, participating in the Agency, 22 have agreed to implement the Code (Spain and Hungary have opted out).  While Ireland is not a major consumer of defence equipment in relative terms, it is expected that adoption of the Code of Conduct may lead to greater competition and lower costs generally in the defence equipment market.</P>
        <P>As adoption of the Code of Conduct is still in the early stages, the full effect has yet to be seen in terms of reductions in equipment costs.  Since adoption of the Code of Conduct in July of this year, there has been no significant procurement undertaken by the Defence Forces as most of our procurement is undertaken in the first half of the financial year.  In due course it is hoped that the effect of the Code of Conduct would be to deliver improved efficiency and value for money in terms of our investment in defensive equipment for the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P>Since October 2005, 183 enquiries have been received by my Department from Plaintiffs regarding the fees paid to solicitors in respect of Army Deafness cases.  Generally these queries refer to the amount of the award or settlement and the costs paid.</P><Col N="1515"/>
        <P>As a matter of course, my Department advises the individual in such cases of the amount of the settlement or award, and the date on which payment issued.  In addition, the amount paid by the State in respect of Plaintiff costs, and the date of such payment, are also advised.</P>
        <P>In responding to enquiries from Plaintiffs, they are also advised that they are entitled to obtain details of the costs in their case from their solicitor under the provisions of Section 68, subsection 6 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.  These provisions oblige a legal representative to provide a summary of the legal services provided and the amount of expenses incurred in the provision of these legal services as well as details of all charges that have been recovered.  We also advise them that the Law Society of Ireland is the statutory body entrusted with responsibility to investigate complaints against solicitors by any client and that the Law Society has procedures in place in this regard.</P>
        <P>I wrote to the Law Society of Ireland at the time of the initial queries regarding solicitors&rsquo; charges in Army hearing loss litigation. In my letter, I asked the Law Society what plans they had to deal with any complaints regarding charging by solicitors in these cases. The Law Society clarified that it was the Statutory Body responsible for dealing with such complaints and that it had procedures in place in this regard.  The Society has power to order a solicitor to repay any excessive amount charged and is anxious to investigate any complaints made against solicitors.</P>
        <P>I wrote again to the Law Society in June 2006 expressing my disappointment with the situation whereby a number of complainants have apparently been advised that the Law Society cannot pursue the matter on the grounds that the bill concerned is over five years old, despite the fact that the complainants have only recently become aware of the potential overcharging.  The Law Society indicated in its response, that it unreservedly condemns any misconduct by a solicitor in overcharging a client. The Society pointed out that the lapse of time since many of the cases were settled posed major difficulties for its investigative powers. The relevant Law Society Solicitors&rsquo; Accounts Regulations require solicitors to maintain accounts, including original files, for a period of six years following conclusion of a case. In a great many of the cases the subject of these complaints, the Society has been informed that, as cases were concluded more than six years ago, the solicitors&rsquo; files, including the documentation necessary to answer the complaint, have been destroyed. In such circumstances, the argument has been made that it would be contrary to natural justice and fair procedures to proceed with investigations where the solicitor complained of did not have access to the documentation necessary to answer a complaint. The Society also made the point that the fact that a <Col N="1516"/>complaint is made does not in itself mean that overcharging occurred. Each case must be examined individually and in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions.</P>
        <P>The Society assured me that there was certainly no lack of will on its part to investigate such complaints in accordance with its statutory powers and the principles of natural justice and fair procedures. The Society also indicated that any client who expresses dissatisfaction with the manner in which their complaint has been handled by the Society, is advised of their entitlement to refer the matter to the Independent Adjudicator of the Law Society for independent review. In addition, it is open to any client to make their complaint directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, which is the forum to which the Society would refer any matter it considers discloses professional misconduct.</P>

	<P>It is not generally the practice to sell defensive equipment. Such equipment is normally scrapped when it is considered to be defunct.</P>
        <P>However, there are a number of categories of equipment that are disposed of. The main category relates to military vehicles. Military vehicles undergo regular maintenance and overhauls to ensure that they are roadworthy and provide value for money service. When, having regard to age, condition and mileage, vehicles are considered by military transport personnel to have reached the end of their economic life, they are proposed for disposal. Before the disposal action can be commenced, each vehicle requires examination and certification by a Military Board of Survey. A procedure has been adopted in recent years whereby all military vehicles are disposed of by public auction with due cognisance given to the age, condition and mileage of the vehicles and their suitability for sale in that manner.</P>
        <P>Tender competitions are held with regard to the disposal of items such as empty Brass Cartridges and used tyres. The main prerogative here for the Department is that tenderers comply with all legislative requirements for the disposal of such goods following which the goods are sold to the highest bidder. In the case of tyres, the Department now pays for the disposal of such used tyres.</P><Col N="1517"/>
        <P>Occasionally, a major asset (s), which has reached the end of its economic working life, is sold off by public tender. An example is the sale of the Naval Ship, LE Deirdre, which was sold for &euro;270,000 in June 2001.   My Department is currently disposing of six Marchetti aircraft, four Dauphin helicopters and one Gazelle.</P>
        <P>From time to time charitable organisations approach the Department requesting that an obsolete vehicle, such as an old ambulance or minibus, be donated to them.  Such requests are considered on their own merit. Registered Charitable Organisations are assisted when possible, allowing for the fact they would not be in a financial position to purchase such a vehicle.</P>

	<P>Accommodation in Cathal Brugha Barracks includes officers married quarters, single living in and low density accommodation for officers and other ranks personnel and billet accommodation used for transit and short term stays for courses etc.  There is in the region of 350 personnel accommodated at present.  In addition, there are twelve other ranks married quarters located outside Cathal Brugha Barracks, eleven of which are presently occupied.  Since 1988 it has been the policy of my Department to sell off married quarters located outside of barracks.  In 1997 these married quarters were offered for sale to the occupants.  There are a number of layout and structural design issues associated with them, especially common shared elements viz., waterpipes, services, access to attics, common green areas, etc.  All twelve quarters must be sold in view of the shared services design.  At that time it was made known that the quarters would only be sold if all of the occupants agreed to purchase.  The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office advised that the Department would not be under any legal obligation to accept any offers from any of the other occupants in the event of one or more of the occupants not proceeding to purchase.  My Department is continuing to explore possible solutions.</P>
        <P>As you are aware, the Government, on 15th July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements.  The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare and Islandbridge, Dublin.  The Government subsequently decided on 1 July 2003 that Magee Barracks, Kildare would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative.  There are no plans to sell Cathal Brugha Barracks.</P>

        <P>The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan, which was formally launched in July 2004, is progressing on schedule.  This plan provides for the phased enhancement of Reserve capabilities over the period to end 2009.  To date the Reserve has been reorganised along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force with three Brigades, a Reserve Defence Force Training Authority located in the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh and a dedicated Naval Service Reserve.  These new organisational structures were introduced on 1st October 2005.  In addition to the reorganisation, the Reserve has seen significant improvements in clothing, equipment and enhanced training opportunities.</P>
        <P>The development of the integrated element of the Reserve is currently being progressed and it is planned to introduce elements of the integrated Reserve, on a pilot basis, in 2007.  This element of the Reserve will provide personnel who will integrate with PDF units in contingency situations.  The Integrated Reserve will be provided with enhanced military training and PDF unit commanders will be responsible for the training of such Reserve personnel.</P>

	<P>There is a shortage of medical officers (Doctors) in the Medical Corps.  The establishment for Medical Officers is 47 and the current strength if 23, of whom 12 are functioning in front line clinical duties in Ireland amongst Brigades and formations.  The services of civilian medical practitioners are regularly engaged to ensure that the primary health care requirements arising in barracks are met.  However, the shortage of dedicated doctors impacts on overall management and control, both at the level of local units and nationally in the Medical Corps.</P>
        <P>Efforts are ongoing to address the shortage of Medical Officers (Doctors) in the Medical Corps.  A recruitment campaign for Doctors is currently under way.  This campaign follows on from a recent decision to significantly increase the pay of Doctors and Dentists in the Medical Corps, linking them to the pay of public health doctors and dentists.</P>
        <P>A review of the provision of medical services in the Defence Forces initiated as part of the Modernisation Agenda under Sustaining Progress has delivered improvements in this area.  This <Col N="1520"/>work involves the Department of Defence including military management and the Representative Associations.  A revised concept document on the provision of medical services and a patients charter are being prepared.  There will be a greater emphasis on the direct provision of medical services and improvements in the maintenance and tracking of patients&rsquo; records and treatment through computerisation.  In the context of the Modernisation agenda arising under &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; it is also intended to review the sick leave arrangements for personnel of the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P>The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was established under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.  On the 19th September 2005, Ms Paulyn Marrinan-Quinn SC was appointed by the President, upon the recommendation of the Government, as the first Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The function of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is to act as the ultimate point of appeal for, and administrative investigation into, complaints made by members (and former members) of the Defence Forces against another member (or former member) of the Defence Forces, or against a civil servant of the Department of Defence.  The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces may investigate a complaint in respect of an action or decision, which may have adversely affected the complainant personally.  The action or decision complained of must have occurred no earlier than the 1st December 2005.</P>
        <P>To date, the office of the Ombudsman has sent me some fourteen (14) reports on individual cases.  I have either responded to or am in the process of responding to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces in respect of each of these case reports.  The Minister for Defence is obliged to inform the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces of the measures taken or proposed in response to her recommendation.</P>
        <P>I can also inform the Deputy that since 1st December 2005, some 91 complaints have been <Col N="1522"/>made within the military system under Section 114 of the Defence Act 1954, as now amended by the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, seeking redress of wrongs.  Those redress complainants, whose complaints relate to matters occurring on or after 1st December 2005, are eligible to refer their complaint to the Ombudsman if a complainant so desires.  I am advised by the Military Authorities that there are some 72 complaints in this category, of which 21 have been referred to the Ombudsman so far.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is, in accordance with the Act, independent in the performance of her duties.  She is required to report annually to the D&aacute;il.  In these circumstances, I do not consider it appropriate for me to report on her behalf or to give details in relation to her reports on individual cases, complaints already submitted to the Office of the Ombudsman, the status of those complaints, or the current treatment of those cases by the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that the primary focus in these cases to date has been on selection for promotion, selection for military career courses and selection for overseas service.  I can also indicate that the reports of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces have made a valuable contribution to the ongoing updating of selection procedures in these three areas.</P>

	<P>The overall objective of the White Paper is to ensure that the country has the Defence Forces it needs to meet the roles laid down by Government and that the Defence Forces continues to be an organisation in which people are proud to serve.  To achieve this the White Paper set out the following broad goals:- to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present; and, to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of new equipment and services for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence.  Significant investment has taken place in recent years and I will continue the good work in that regard.  In recent years the main focus of that investment has been as follows: The Defence Forces have <Col N="1523"/>acquired a total of 65 new APCS in recent years from Mowag in Switzerland at a total cost of &euro;84m, paid over the years 1999 to 2005.  Mowag APCs are currently on operational duties with our troops in Kosovo, Liberia and now Lebanon.  In December 2005, a further contract was signed with Mowag for the supply in 2007 of 15 additional Piranha Armoured Vehicles, 9 of which will be fitted with a Kongsberg Remote Weapon Station with a 12.7mm machine gun and 6 will be fitted with an Oto Melara turret armed with a 30mm cannon.  The 15 vehicles will be used mainly in the Surveillance and Reconnaissance roles on overseas missions.  The contract value is in the region of &euro;36.5m including VAT.  A down payment in the sum of &euro;15.1m was made under the contract in December 2005.  Payments under the contract will extend to January 2008.  The Javelin system was acquired from Raytheon / Lockheed Martin via the US Foreign Military Sales at a cost of some &euro;13m inclusive of VAT to give Defence Forces personnel an effective, anti-armour capability while on peace support operations.  The system replaced the Milan missile system.  The main delivery was made in 2005.</P>
        <P>A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing over recent years.  The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting their members in dealing with Nuclear, Biological or Chemical (NBC) threats.  This range includes approximately 9,500 NBC suits, 800 of which were delivered in 2006.  Other equipment on hands includes Respirators, Biological Agent Detector and Screening Kits, Group Decontamination Equipment and Personal Decontamination Equipment.  Over &euro;8m has been expended on this programme in recent years.</P>
        <P>An order has been placed for the supply of 1400 new 9mm general service pistols.  The value of the order is in the region of &euro;800k.  It is expected that the new pistols will be delivered by the end of 2006.  The pistols are carried for personal protection on security and regimental duties at home, and on overseas service.  An order was placed in 2005 for the provision of 400 General Purpose Machine Guns for delivery late 2006.  The value of the order is in the region of &euro;4.379m, with a down payment of &euro;1.447m paid in 2005.  Six Field Deployable Command Post Containers have been delivered to the Curragh Camp.  The value of the order was almost &euro;3m. Two of the containers have been deployed to Lebanon.  Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System &mdash;This includes Body Armour, Helmets and Back Packs (Rucksacks).</P>
        <P>8000 units of body armour for the individual soldier on operational duties have been ordered.  The new body armour provides significantly greater protection, comfort and coverage than the old model as well as a doubling of the range of sizes available.  The total value of the two orders <Col N="1524"/>is in the region of &euro;8m and full delivery is expected by end 2006.  12,000 helmets have been delivered.  The value of the order was circa. &euro;2.5m.  12,000 rucksacks have been ordered at a total cost of &euro;3m, delivery to take place in 2007.</P>
        <P>To complete the modern integrated protection and load carrying system, one other competition is currently in train for the acquisition of 12,000 Battle Vests used for the carriage by the individual soldier of essential items such as ammunition, personal radio, water and ancillary equipment.</P>
        <P>The eight Pilatus PC-9M turbo propeller aircraft delivered in 2004, at a total cost of &euro;60m, have replaced seven Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role.  These eight modern aircraft allow for the continued training of young cadets to the highest standards.  Four utility AW 139 helicopters are being acquired from Agusta S.p.A.  at a cost of &euro;48.4m, inclusive of VAT.  The four helicopters are being built at the Agusta facility near Milan, Italy.  Two AW 139s will be delivered in November 2006 and the other two will be delivered in 2007.  Payments for the helicopters are spread over a number of years from 2004 to 2008.  The first helicopter has now been handed over to the Department and is currently being used for Air Corps pilot training in Italy.</P>
        <P>The four AW 139 helicopters will be operated by the Air Corps in a general purpose military operational and training role.  Primary taskings for the Utility helicopter will include training and operations with Special Forces, security and aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport.  They will also be used to perform air ambulance, inland Search and Rescue, aid to the civil community and VIP transport tasks.</P>
        <P>Two light utility EC 135 helicopters have being acquired from Eurocopter S.A.S. at a cost of &euro;12.8m, inclusive of VAT.  The two helicopters were built at Eurocopter&rsquo;s facility in Donauworth, Germany.  Both EC 135&rsquo;s were delivered in the latter part of 2005 and have entered operational service.  The Air Corps are operating the two Light Utility helicopters primarily in the military pilot and aircrew-training role.  Primary taskings for the helicopters will include pilot training, instructor training and instrument flight training.</P>
        <P>In recent years, two new ships have been delivered to the Naval Service and the Service is operating with the recommended eight ships.  LE Roisin was commissioned in December 1999 and her sister ship, LE Niamh, which replaced LE Deirdre, was commissioned in September 2001.  The total cost of the two ships was &euro;50m.</P>
        <P>The past five years represents an investment of more than &euro;500 million in acquiring and supporting modern equipment and services for the Defence Forces.  In the same period there has been an investment of over &euro;200 million in building and infrastructure across the Defence Forces.  All of this equipment has been acquired as a <Col N="1525"/>result of tender competitions run in accordance with both nation and EU requirements.  A wide range of manufacturers has provided the equipment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that all food supplies for the Defence Forces are procured centrally by the Food Procurement Section of the Defence Forces, who place contracts with suppliers in ten separate food categories e.g. Dairy Produce, Poultry Produce, Pack Rations.  Tender competitions are run for all such contracts in accordance with National and EU regulations.  Contractors submit tenders to supply food produce to barracks within their area of operations and contracts are awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender received.</P>
        <P>The food bill for the Defence Forces in 2005 was &euro;5.9 million and to date in 2006, &euro;4.4 million has been expended on food.  These amounts include food provisions for home and for non-UN overseas missions.  A number of low fat and low salt food products are provided to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made to accommodate Defence Forces personnel who have particular dietary requirements.  The Defence Forces School of Catering trains its chefs to facilitate such requirements, whether for personal, health, religious or other reasons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy&rsquo;s question notes, a number of statements were made in the course of a recent hearing in the High Court of a personal injuries claim against the State for damages, arising from alleged sexual assaults allegedly committed by a <Col N="1526"/>former NCO against the Plaintiff in those particular proceedings.  The alleged assaults were claimed to have taken place in a time frame spanning the period 1989 to 1995.  The judgement of the High Court is awaited and I cannot comment on the substance of the case in any way whatsoever.</P>
        <P>It should be emphasized that the statements arose in the context of the attitudes to homosexual behaviour and to homosexuality which would have been prevalent within the Defence Forces within the particular period of the time frame relevant to the case and also within a wider historical framework dating back to the 1970s.  Moreover, it should be recalled that certain acts of homosexual behaviour continued to constitute criminal acts, potentially carrying a punishment of imprisonment in the event of conviction, until substantive amendment of the relevant legislation in 1993.</P>
        <P>Contemporary legislation, in the form of the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 to 2004, prohibits discrimination on nine specified grounds.  One of these specified grounds is sexual orientation.  The Defence Forces Equality and Equal Status Policy (Chapter 6.6.2) clearly prohibits discrimination in relation to race, gender and sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces are committed to identifying and valuing difference in the staff to take account of the promotion of equality of opportunity on the grounds of race, gender, sexual orientation, family and marital status, religious belief and membership of the Traveller community.  Recognising difference, naming them and taking account of them is part of the new culture of equality in the Defence Forces that is becoming more diversified and a society that is more cosmopolitan and varied.</P>
        <P>Regulations do exist covering interpersonal relationships of whatever nature between individual members of the Defence Forces, having appropriate regard, in particular, to differences in rank.  This is necessary in the context of the specific nature and structure of the Defence Forces.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, I had a number of discussions with the Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) in relation to this matter last year, with a view to increasing the level of contribution by the Banks in respect of the costs incurred by the Department in the provision of Cash Escorts.  Following detailed and intensive discussions between <Col N="1527"/>officials of the IBF, the member Banks and the Department, a detailed formal agreement was signed on 11 May, 2005.</P>
        <P>This agreement, which is for a 5 year period, provides that the banks will pay the total actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts.  Costs in respect of each 12 month period to end-December, will be paid the following year on or before the 1st June.  This is to allow for the compilation of returns from the brigades and allocation of costs following the year-end.  The first payment under the new system was paid on 1 June 2006.  I agreed, at the bank&rsquo;s request, to defer the first payment to that date to meet the banks budgeting and accounting timeframe.</P>
        <P>In return for my agreement to this deferral, a transitional payment of &euro;1 million, payable before the end of 2005, was negotiated as part of the overall agreement.  Therefore in 2005 the banks made their annual payment of &euro;2.86m plus <Col N="1528"/>the additional &euro;1m making a total contribution of &euro;3.86m.  A figure of &euro;6.03 million was paid in 2006. The amount to be paid in 2007 (costs for 2006) will not be available until early 2007.</P>
        <P>Prior to this initiative it had been the case that an annual contribution of &euro;2.86m was being paid by the banks to my Department in respect of the provision of cash escorts since 1995.  This figure was set by the Department of Finance in the 1995 budget and had not been altered since.  The contribution from the Banks was designed to part-cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts.  At that time, the contribution covered approximately 72% of the total cost arising to the Defence Forces.  Based on annual costings by the Department, the relative level of the contribution had fallen in real terms over the years to the situation where it was only covering 43% of the total costs.</P>
        <P>The total cost in respect of the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in protecting movements of cash for the years 2001 to 2005 was as follows:</P><Col N="1527"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 71 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not contribute to the NATO Response Force and, as such, will not be participating in the related field exercises.  Ireland does not participate in field exercises with NATO forces.  However, as part of our participation in Partnership for Peace, on occasion, Ireland participates along with other partners in NATO organised desktop exercises.  These exercises are designed to familiarise PfP participants with NATO standard operating procedures and prac<Col N="1528"/>tices and to improve overall interoperability among contributors to PfP-led peace support and crisis management operations.  The Defence Forces are currently participating in Exercise Steadfast JAW, a combined joint task force desktop exercise which is taking place at the moment (9-22 November 2006).  This exercise is designed to test and improve Headquarter capabilities to plan, prepare and establish command and control arrangements for the conduct of operations under a UN mandate.  The Defence Forces also participate in Exercise Combined Endeavor, a yearly communication and information (CIS) interoperability exercise.</P>
        <P>In relation to our participation in EU Battlegroups, it is planned that joint training of the Nordic Battlegroup elements, including field manoeuvres, will take place in Sweden in September/October 2007 for a period of approximately 3 to 4 weeks.  No other joint training or field exercises by the Defence Forces, including field exercises outside of the Battlegroup participants is planned.</P>

	<P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements.  The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare, and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
        <P>The sale of 97 acres approximately at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig was completed in 2003 for a total of &euro;42 million.  The bulk of the lands were purchased by O&rsquo;Flynn Construction.  The sale of a site comprising c. 2.7 acres to the Southern Health Board for &euro;1.73 million was completed in December 2004.  19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, were sold to Cork County Council in 2001 for &euro;0.974 million for development in conjunction with the IDA.</P>
        <P>Castleblayney Military Post, Co. Monaghan, comprising c. 10 acres, was sold to the North Eastern Health Board for &euro;0.762 million in 2002.  7 acres at Devoy Barracks, Naas, Co. Kildare, were ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for &euro;8.888 million.  The balance of the Barracks lands &mdash; one acre &mdash; was sold to Kildare County Council for &euro;0.381 million in 2002.  Clancy Barracks, Dublin, comprising 13.65 acres approximately, was sold to Florence Properties Ltd. for &euro;25.4 million in 2004.</P>
        <P>The Government agreed on 16 December 2003 to the release of circa 2.5 acres at St. Bricin&rsquo;s Military Hospital, Dublin for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative.  The site was recently transferred to Dublin City Council as specified by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for a nominal consideration.</P>
        <P>Details of additional military property which was surplus to requirements and which was disposed of since 1997 are as follows:- 6.39 acres, known as &ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s Field&rdquo;, adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork, was sold to Cork City Council for &euro;1.523 million in 2002; circa 3.4 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, was disposed of to Limerick City Council for &euro;1.162 million in 2002/2003; a site comprising circa 0.931 acre, adjacent to my Department&rsquo;s RDF premises in Kanturk, Co. Cork, was disposed of to the Southern Health Board for a consideration of &euro;0.178 million in 2003; approximately 1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks was sold to Waterford City Council for &euro;0.662 million in 2003; the sale by public tender of Belmont Huts, Cobh, Co. Cork, comprising c. 2.89 acres, to a Wexford based partnership for &euro;2.4 million, was completed during 2004; Spike Island, Co. Cork, was sold to the Department of Justice for &euro;0.065 million in 2004; Custume <Col N="1530"/>House, Athlone was sold to the Organisation of National Ex-servicemen and women Teoranta for &euro;0.254 million in 2005; In addition, in excess of 100 married quarters, which were located outside of barracks, have been disposed of, realising an income of over &euro;4 million.</P>
        <P>A number of minor properties were also disposed of during the period in question.  In addition, from time to time land at various locations has been dedicated to local authorities to allow for projects such as road widening or realignment schemes.  The sale of c. 1.7 acres at the former Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, to the HSE-South and the transfer of 27 acres at the property to Cork County Council are being progressed at present.  A half acre site at the former Barracks has also been reserved for sale to the Office of Public Works, to facilitate extension of Ballincollig Garda Station.  The legal formalities for the definitive disposal of Fort Camden, Crosshaven, Co. Cork, to Cork County Council are nearing conclusion.</P>
        <P>Agreement has recently been reached with Cork City Council for the sale of part of the Camp Field, Collins Barracks to that Authority.  The Government decided that lands at Magee Barracks, Kildare, and Gormanston Camp, Co. Meath, as well as sites at St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin and Collins Barracks, Cork, would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative.  As I have  mentioned above, the site at St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital has already been transferred to Dublin City Council.  How land at the remaining locations might play a role in the delivery of affordable housing units is a matter in the first instance for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the development of the Affordable Housing Initiative.  The legal formalities relating to the transfer of lands at these locations under the Affordable Housing Initiative are being progressed in consultation with that Department and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.</P>
        <P>Further disposals in progress include: c.1.07 acres at Arbour Hill, Dublin to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Town Hall, Ballyconnell to Cavan County Council; c. 20 acres of the Curragh lands to Kildare County Council in connection with the construction of the Kildare By-pass; and c. 10 acres of land at Renmore, Galway to Galway City Council.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s commitment under the White Paper on Defence the funding realised from the sale of properties has been used for an ongoing equipment and infrastructure modernisation programme.  This programme has ensured that the Defence Forces are fully equipped with the most modern of equipment for their day-to-day roles, both at home and on overseas missions.</P><Col N="1531"/>
        <P>It is the policy of my Department to dispose of properties that are surplus to military requirements.  In this regard the property portfolio is kept under on-going review and any properties deemed surplus to military requirements will be disposed of to fund much needed investment, to meet the equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P>The book to which the Deputy refers was launched by the author last May.  My Department has examined the contents of the publication.  The book does not present any new material of significance to the history of the case.  The basic premise of the book was previously presented in a newspaper article written in summer 2002 by the author of the book.</P>
        <P>The individual concerned was retired by the President, on the advice of the Government, with effect from a date in June, 1969.  His retirement was effected pursuant to Section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954 and Paragraph 18(1)(f) of Defence Force Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo;.  The Deputy will appreciate that any decision to retire an officer &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo; is extremely unusual in principle and would only be taken for the most compelling reasons.</P>
        <P>The Government advice to the President in this case was on grounds of security.  I am satisfied that the matter was handled in an entirely appropriate and proper manner in 1969 and that the decision taken then was taken only after very detailed and due consideration.  The position at this stage is that the individual concerned has had access to all documents relating to his retirement since 14 November, 2002 when his legal representatives attended the Department and were given copies of all the relevant records held in my Department.

        <Quest> the number of Defence Forces personnel tested in 2004, 2005 and to date in 2006 under the drug testing programme; the numbers who tested positive; the procedures in force when a member tested positive; the number of personnel dismissed as a result of testing positive; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Drug abuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society and while there have been relatively few instances of drug related problems within the Defence Forces, it is recognised that the Defence Forces, as a component of the wider community, mirror the community at large.  The implications of drug abuse in an organisation where personnel have access to firearms are too obvious to require elaboration.</P>
        <P>A Compulsory Substance Testing Programme was introduced on 1 February 2002, as part of a <Col N="1533"/>Defence Forces Substance Abuse Programme, following a long consultative process involving the Office of the Attorney General, the Deputy Judge Advocate General and the Defence Forces Representative Associations.</P>
        <P>Prior to the launch of the programme, an education programme and awareness briefings were conducted throughout the Defence Forces.  All personnel were issued with a booklet devised to inform them of the purpose of the new Compulsory Random Drug Testing programme, the administrative actions involved and the procedures to be followed for those who test positive.  All necessary measures, including pre-enlistment screening, education, compulsory random drug testing, monitoring and sanctions, will be taken to maintain a drug free environment within the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of Compulsory Random Drugs Testing is deterrence.  In order to provide a credible level of deterrent, the testing programme has been devised to maximise the possibility of random selection for testing.  A trained Drugs Testing Team is responsible for taking <Col N="1534"/>urine samples for compulsory random testing throughout the Defence Forces. Testing commenced on 14th November 2002 and the programme is now in its fourth year of operation.  The target of testing 10% of the Permanent Defence Force has been achieved.  A member of the Permanent Defence Force, randomly selected, may be required, at any time, to provide a urine sample which will be tested for evidence of use of controlled drugs, or the abuse or misuse of other substances, or for the detection of the metabolites thereof.  A member of the PDF who refuses to provide a urine sample, or who provides a urine sample which tests positive, may be liable to retirement, discharge or relinquishment of commission or withdrawal of cadetship as appropriate under the provisions of Defence Force Regulations.</P>
        <P>The following table outlines the number of Defence Forces personnel tested under the compulsory random drugs testing programme for 2004, 2005 and to date in 2006.  It also indicates the number of positive tests and the number discharged as a result of testing positive.</P><Col N="1533"/>

	<P>Expenditure under the Defence and Army Pensions Votes has increased from &euro;646 million in 1997 to an estimated outturn of &euro;958 million in 2006.  This represents an increase in defence spending of some 48% over that period.</P><Col N="1535"/>
        <P>The level of expenditure on defence in any particular country is influenced by a variety of factors, including that country&rsquo;s political and security environment, its history, demography and economy.  While defence spending in this country has fallen as a percentage of GNP in recent years, this is not due to any reduction in the level of defence expenditure, but rather because of the massive increase in GNP.</P>
        <P>There has been an unprecedented level of expenditure on infrastructure and equipment for the Defence Forces in recent years.  This was made possible by the Government&rsquo;s decision that pay savings arising from the reorganization of the Defence Forces, set out in the White Paper 2000, along with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be fully reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment.</P>

        <Quest> if he will report on the recent deployment of Irish troops to Liberia as part of UNMIL; the plans for this to be Ireland&rsquo;s final deployment to UNMIL; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[38108/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) was established on 19 September, 2003, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1509.  The resolution authorised the deployment, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, for a period of twelve months, of up to 15,000 military personnel, to include up to 250 military observers, 875 civilian police officers and a civilian component.  UNMIL has a current strength of approximately 15,000 military personnel.</P>
        <P>Following Government and D&aacute;il approval, a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force was deployed for service with UNMIL in December 2003, comprising a motorised infantry battalion, of some 430 personnel.  A small number of additional personnel were also deployed at Force Headquarters and as Military Observers.  On 2 November 2004 and 6 December 2005 the Government reviewed and approved the continued participation of the Defence Forces in UNMIL.</P>
        <P>The main Irish contingent operates as the Force Commander&rsquo;s Rapid Reaction Reserve. The role of the Irish personnel is the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force, to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis situation.</P>
        <P>Initially, the Irish Battalion in UNMIL mainly operated in a path-finding and reconnaissance role, supporting the deployment of other UN contingents.  It has also conducted long-range patrols beyond Monrovia and well into the interior of Liberia, showing a UN presence, deterring lawlessness and protecting local populations.  The contingent also undertakes regular daily patrols within the Monrovia area.  The Irish Battalion is available to the Force Commander to provide support and a rapid response capability in the event of a breakdown in law and order or further conflict.  Additionally, the Quick Reaction Force (QRF) conducted patrols supporting the preparatory arrangements leading up to, and during, the National Elections in Liberia, held on 11 October, 2005 and 8 November, 2005.</P>
        <P>On 11 November, 2005, the UN Security Council extended UNMIL&rsquo;s mandate to include the apprehension, detention and transfer to the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) of the former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, in the event of his return to Liberia. UNMIL assumed responsibility for the security of the Special Court for Sierra Leone from 1 December, 2005.  This allowed Irish and Swedish troops to be made available for extraction operations should there be a requirement to evacuate the staff and <Col N="1537"/>detainees of the Special Court of Sierra Leone in Freetown.</P>
        <P>The QRF assisted in the transfer from Monrovia to the Special Court for Sierra Leone in Freetown of the former President, Charles Taylor, for trial in accordance with the requirements of the UN, following his arrest in Nigeria on 29 March 2006.  The QRF also assisted and provided security for the transfer of the former President from Sierra Leone to the court in The Hague in June 2006 where he will stand trial.  The trial will be conducted by a Trial Chamber of the Special Court.  The Court has set 2 April, 2007 as the tentative trial date.</P>
        <P>Ireland was due to complete its participation in UNMIL in November 2006. However, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, requested Ireland to consider postponing the withdrawal of its troops from UNMIL for a period of at least six months, in order to give the UN time to find a suitable replacement for the QRF capability. The Government following a detailed review of the request, was happy to be able to respond positively to the UN Secretary General and this month the Defence Forces will undertake one further 6 month rotation to May, 2007, whereupon the contingent will then be withdrawn.  The downsizing of the Irish contingent, as part of a phased withdrawal, commenced in June 2006, following discussions with the UN.  The Swedish contingent, which previously partnered Ireland in the QRF, withdrew from UNMIL yesterday and was replaced by a Company from Pakistan.  Pakistan will take over the full role of the QRF on Ireland&rsquo;s withdrawal in May 2007. The 96th Infantry Battalion, which is currently being deployed to UNMIL, will be the final Defence Forces deployment to the mission.</P>

The existing site in Cork city has been considered in detail and is not deemed to be suitable.  The prison facility on Spike Island offers obvious advantages from a security perspective and is immediately available for development.  No other sites in the Cork region have been offered for prison development, however, if another suitable site becomes available I would, as a matter of course, give it due consideration. </P>

I am further informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Ballina has been received by the CCTV Advisory Committee.  This application is currently under consideration by the Committee. No other applications for Garda CCTV systems in Co. Mayo have been received by the Garda CCTV Advisory Committee .</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware I launched the Community Based CCTV Scheme on 15 June 2005 in response to the demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems.  This Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.   Ballina (CCTV <Col N="1540"/>Steering Committee) and Kiltimagh (IRD) both submitted proposals for Stage 1 (pre-development) funding under this Scheme.  No other applications were received from local authorities, towns or communities in Co. Mayo.</P>
        <P>Following thorough assessments of their applications, a pre-development grant of &euro;5,000 was approved in respect of Ballina (CCTV Steering Committee&rsquo;s) application.  I understand that Ballina Town Council formed part of this Committee.  Kiltimagh&rsquo;s (IRD) application for funding was deemed not to reach a high enough standard to be granted funding at this stage.  It is intended to invite a new round of applications for funding under this Scheme in the coming months, and it is, of course, open to any local authority or other group in Co. Mayo to submit an application for funding at that stage.</P>

        <Quest> if he will arrange for a speedy decision to be given to a person (details supplied) in County Wicklow who has applied for permanent residency in order that they have documentation that will allow them to travel to be with their family at Christmas time and get back into Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>There is no provision for the granting of permanent residency in Irish Immigration legislation.  However, the proposed Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will, for the first time, make statutory provision for a status of long term resident. An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received on the 26th June 2006.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not exempt the person from employment permit requirements.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  I understand that applications received in May 2006 are currently <Col N="1541"/>being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</P>

I can confirm receipt of an application in respect of the person in question  by the Honorary Consul in Kiev on 30th May, 2006. This single journey visa was issued. In general, multiple-entry visas may be issued when an applicant has demonstrated a compliant travel history to Ireland in the recent  past.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of High Visibility <Col N="1547"/>Specially Adapted Vehicles is as set out in the following table:</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently over 1,900 civilian staff working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Very significant developments have taken place in the area of civilianisation recently and I will now outline the key aspects.  The Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) in Castlebar is now fully operational, with some 160 civilian staff now employed there.  The GISC allows Garda&iacute; who would otherwise have to return to their Stations to input data on the PULSE system, to log the information with the GISC, while remaining on the beat.  This major initiative has freed up significant amounts of Garda time for continued operational duty.  The Garda authorities are already considering what other tasks could be devolved to the GISC which would release additional Garda resources to front-line policing.</P>
        <P>On 16 October, 2006, I made an Order to give effect to the transfer of civilian staff to the direct control of the Garda Commissioner, a reform provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  This followed the conclusion of discussions with staff interests.  As part of the agreement with the staff side on the transfer of staff, sanction has been granted by the Minister for Finance for an additional 76 civilian clerical and administrative posts to be located around the country on a regional and divisional basis.  Recruitment to these posts will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>A new Human Resources Division for civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has now been established.  When fully operational, the Division will have a staffing complement of 37 civilians who will carry out recruitment, training, discipline, industrial relations and general HR administrative functions for the 1,900 clerical, administrative, professional, technical and industrial civilians now working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Division will also play a key strategic role in driving forward the wider Civilianisation Programme. <Col N="1548"/> The Director and a number of staff have commenced duty, and recruitment of the remaining staff is underway.</P>
        <P>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, the Commissioner became the Accounting Officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July this year.  This transfer of responsibility is being supported by the recruitment of nine (9) civilian Finance &amp; Procurement staff.</P>
        <P>My Department has also received sanction from my colleague the Minister for Finance to civilianise 31 posts in the Garda Telecommunications area. These positions, most of which were previously occupied by Garda&iacute;, will be advertised shortly.  Progress is also being made on recruitment to a range of new civilian posts, including:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />28 staff (statisticians, analysts and administrative staff) for the Professional Standards Unit;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />10 internal audit posts;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />14 additional teaching/training posts in the Garda College, Templemore; and</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />29 crime analysts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the Deputy can see, considerable progress is now being made in driving the Civilianisation Programme forward to ensure that the Garda&iacute; being recruited in the current historic expansion of the Force are deployed to front-line policing duties, and that appropriately trained and qualified civilians make the greatest contribution possible consistent with the effective and efficient functioning of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am confident that the progress now being made on civilianisation will deliver on both fronts.</P>

	<P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development and promote civic responsibility.  The Garda Youth Diversion Projects are funded by my Department and administered through Garda Community Relations Section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The allocation of funding for the 74 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (along with 7 Local Drug Task Force Projects) in 2006 is just over &euro;6.6 million, which is an increase of &euro;1.2 million on 2005.</P><Col N="1549"/><?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>It is my intention to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.  As part of this expansion, ten new projects were established this year and they are located in Blanchardstown, Birr, Carlow, Castlebar, Cavan, Clondalkin, Limerick, Tallaght and Tralee (two projects). I expect to announce a further ten projects in the near future.</P>
        <P>There are currently four Garda Youth Diversion Projects based in Limerick city and 25 Garda Youth Diversion Projects and two Local Drugs Task Force Projects based in Dublin city.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware I launched the Community Based CCTV Scheme on 15 June 2005 in response to the demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems.  This Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems. The Scheme is being administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>Under this Scheme, communities could apply for grant aid funding of up to &euro;100,000 from the Department to install a CCTV system in their area.  In addition, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs gave a commitment to provide successful applicants from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of &euro;100,000 subject to the total grant aid from both Departments not exceeding &euro;200,000 or 100% of the capital costs of the project, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>The Community Based CCTV Scheme offered two Stages or options that were designed to meet the requirements of communities in both of these situations. Stage 1 offered pre-development supports and possible funding of up to &euro;5,000 for organisations/groups who were not yet ready to develop their proposals fully. The Stage 2 process offered a direct Application Process to those organisations who could demonstrate an ability to develop and deliver a CCTV Programme immediately.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that, following a detailed evaluation process, a total of 37 groups were selected to receive grant aid under the Scheme.  24 groups were selected to receive Stage 1 grants of up to &euro;5,000 each and I understand from Pobal that all of these grants were paid by end April 2006.  13 groups were selected to receive Stage 2 grants.  Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005, requires that each of these groups receive authorisation from the Garda Com<Col N="1550"/>missioner, following consultation with the Joint Policing Committee for that administrative area.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 16 November 2006, one group has received authorisation from the Garda Commissioner and accordingly received the initial payment of their approved grant.  A further 5 groups have submitted their applications for authorisation to the Garda authorities and these are currently being processed.  I am advised by Pobal that the remaining 7 groups are currently compiling their applications for authorisation and these will be forwarded to the Garda authorities in due course.</P>

	<P>This matter was given detailed consideration in the context of the 2005 Finance Bill  and for the following reasons it was decided that there was no case for the introduction of tax relief for the purchase costs of suckler cow quota. </P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">(a) Under the new Single  Payment Scheme farmers have been credited with the average number of animals on which premium was paid under the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme over the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002.</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) Farmers who purchased suckler cow quota since 1993 and up to and including the 2000 scheme years have received the full benefit of this quota in their Single  Farm payment if they used their quota during the three reference years. There are also adequate provisions under the National Reserve to cater for farmers who purchased quota from January 2001 up until the date of the announcement of full decoupling on 19 October 2003.</P>
        <P LI="1">(c) Farmers who purchased suckler cow quota after 19 October 2003 for the 2004 scheme year should have been aware of the changes to the CAP and the introduction of the Single Payment and the consequent abolition of quota.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 to 113, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including services for persons with eating disorders, were considered by the expert group on mental health policy. The group&rsquo;s report entitled &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; was published in January 2006.  The report has been accepted by Government as the basis for the development of a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; acknowledges gaps in the current provision of mental health services for persons with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.  Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders, the further development of primary and community care service and the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a national centre for eating disorders for complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has established an implementation group to plan and manage the full implementation of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;. An independent monitoring group has also been <Col N="1565"/>established to monitor progress in implementing the report&rsquo;s recommendations and will report to me on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>Overall responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.  Therefore, the executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular questions raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including wired broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to support the private sector developing a competitive, affordable, and innovative market that offers choice of products and providers to Irish consumers and businesses.</P>
        <P>However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband. My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.</P>
        <P>Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity. The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector.</P><Col N="1568"/>
        <P>The Department also offered funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the Group Broadband Scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 160 projects have been approved for funding under this Programme. The most recent call for proposals has now closed and the question of a further round of financial assistance is under consideration.</P>
        <P>The following projects were approved under the group broadband scheme for the Cork south west area and these are now operational.</P>

Under the first ACCESS scheme, introduced in 2001, &euro;45.7 million was allocated for the development of 44 arts and cultural facilities around the country.  The increase in the availability of facilities and the enhancement in their quality have greatly increased access to and participation in the arts for a great many people.</P>
        <P>In July last I announced a new capital funding scheme &mdash; ACCESS II.  This new scheme will provide grant aid towards the development of arts and culture infrastructure around the country over the years 2007-2009.  The scheme is intended to provide a further impetus to the development of arts and culture facilities, thereby enhancing the quality of life for our citizens.  Eligible facilities will include integrated arts centres, theatres and galleries, as well as arts studios and creative and performance spaces.  While the intention is to prioritise the enhancement and maintenance of existing facilities, there will also be provision under the terms of the scheme to support new build projects.   Applications for ACCESS II are being accepted until 17 November 2006.</P>
        <P>The principal source of non-capital state funding for the arts is the Arts Council, which, although funded by my Department, is independent in its day-to-day operations.</P>

In such cases, the normal age of retirement tends to be approximately 65 years of age but can be above or below that, thus giving flexibility to employers and <Col N="1572"/>employees, having due regard to the nature of the work being performed.</P>
        <P>The Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004, administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, protect against discrimination on the grounds of age, and on other grounds, in relation to access to employment.  However, the Acts do permit an employer to decide on a retirement age in a particular employment without being in breach of the age-discrimination provisions of the above-mentioned equality legislation.</P>
        <P>Terms and conditions of employment, including proposed changes to such terms and conditions, are determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the employers and employees or their representatives.  The State facilitates the bargaining process by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper.  Institutions are in place that can assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers such as the Labour Relations Commission, including its Rights Commissioner Service, and the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>Disputes that arise in relation to provisions in contracts of employment may concern matters of contract law.  Advice on contract law, if required, should be obtained from a legal professional.</P>

    <entry>Arising from the Good Friday Agreement, 1998, the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, established six North/South Implementation Bodies including InterTradeIreland. The Board of InterTradeIreland ordinarily consists of twelve Members, six of whom are nominated by the South and six by the North. There are currently eleven Members on the Board of InterTradeIreland.
As a result of the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly in October 2002, the North/South Ministerial Council cannot meet. As a consequence the British-Irish Agreements have been amended. The amendments provide that during the period of suspension of the North/South Ministerial Council, the British and Irish Governments take joint decisions, when appropriate, on matters relating to InterTrade Ireland and the other North/South Implementation Bodies.</entry>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of occupational pensions in Ireland is on a voluntary basis and depends on the willingness of employers to contribute to and maintain schemes for their employees. Traditionally, such schemes were organised on a defined benefit basis. However, in recent years defined benefit provision has been under pressure because of volatility in the stock markets and increasing liabilities arising from demographic pressures, low interest rates, increasing wage costs that translate into higher benefits and regulatory requirements.  New accountancy standards, which make pensions liabilities transparent on a company&rsquo;s balance sheet, are also contributing to the pressures under which defined benefit schemes are now operating. A drift from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes is now apparent, even in cases where firms are very profitable.  This is, in my view, a regrettable development. However, at this stage, further regulation would only serve to add to the pressures on defined benefit provision and could be counter productive.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, the Government has committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the social partnership agreement Towards 2016. The Green Paper will outline the major policy choices, the challenges in this area and the views of the social partners.</P>
        <P>Also, as part of this agreement, the Pensions Board has been asked to research benefit design options in the occupational pensions area and to examine current design issues in both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements, with a view to producing guidance as to designs which encompass the positive elements of each arrangement while adjusting the costs and risks to the parties involved.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to produce the Green Paper by the end of March next year. A consultation process will follow this and the Government will respond to these consultations by developing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the long-term.</P>

        <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a recipient of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity can apply to their local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement.  In addition, legislation also provides for a single payment &mdash; known as an exceptional needs payment &mdash; to be made to help meet essential, once-off exceptional expenditure.</P>
        <P>The Dublin/ Mid Leinster Area of the Executive have advised that the person concerned has made no application for an exceptional needs payment or a heating supplement in 2006. The Executive has forwarded an application form and supporting information to the person concerned in order that she can make an application for assistance.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory) a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on his/her social insurance record. Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as 10 contributions and arrangements are also in place for the payment of pro-rata pensions to those with mixed rate insurance records or contributions from other EU member status or countries with which Ireland has a reciprocal agreement. The range of reduced payments has been expanded over the years to allow more people to qualify for a contributory pension. </P>
        <P>Reduced rate or pro-rata pensions are paid as a percentage of the full rate payment and, in order to ensure that the relationship between the various rates is maintained, Budget increases are also applied on a pro-rata basis. Applying the full budgetary increase to those with reduced payments would erode the differentials which exist and which are intended to reflect broadly the level of contribution which a person has made to the social insurance fund.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the qualifying conditions for state pension (contributory) requires a person to have a yearly average of 10 paid or credited contributions from 1953 or from the date of entry into insurance (whichever is the later) to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age. In order to qualify for the maximum rate a yearly average of 48 contributions is required.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was awarded state pension (contributory) at 75% of the maximum rate, which is based on a yearly average of 16 contributions.  According to my Department&rsquo;s records, she received carer&rsquo;s allowance from 1990 until July 1994 when the person being cared for died.  Credits could not be awarded for the duration of the carer&rsquo;s allowance claim as more than 2 years had elapsed since the person concerned had last paid social insurance contributions.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that as many people as possible qualify for pensions in their own right, a number of measures have been introduced over the years which make it easier to qualify for contributory pensions.  One of these is the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to 10 and the person concerned has benefited from this improvement.</P>
        <P>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme introduced by my Department in 1994 protects the social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  This scheme allows up to 20 years from 1994 onwards spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  The scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension as the standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, have a minimum of 260 paid contributions and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied.</P><Col N="1588"/>
        <P>In general, changes to insurability of employment are not backdated and the same principle was applied to the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme in 1994.  However, a review of the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme and other issues relating to social welfare pensions is taking place in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions, to which the Government is committed as part of the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  At this stage it is planned to publish the Green Paper by the end of March next year.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy later next year.</P>

	<P>An important feature of the overall rail development plans included in Transport 21 is the development of an integrated network, which will enable passengers to transfer between suburban rail, METRO and LUAS at a number of interchange stations.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 150 together.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  Each school management authority is required to organise its time-table and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions.</P>
        <P>An application for curricular concessions was received from the school referred to by the Deputy and the school in question was allocated an additional 1 wholetime equivalent teacher post.  An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.  This school availed of this appeals mechanism and were allocated a further .5 wholetime equivalent teacher post. The decision of the Appeals Committee is final.  As the Appeals Committee operates independently of my Department in taking its decisions, you will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to intervene in any such decision.</P>
        <P>It is a fundamental principle of the Free Second Level Education Scheme that no charge be made in respect of:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) instruction in any subject of my Department&rsquo;s Programme for Secondary Schools;</P><Col N="1599"/>
        <P LI="1">(b) recreation or study facilities where all pupils are expected to avail themselves of them as part of the school programme.</P>
         <P LI="1">(c) any other activity in which all pupils are required to take part.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Accordingly, it would be a breach of my Department&rsquo;s policy for post-primary schools involved in the Free Second Level Education Scheme to demand or levy a fee.  However, voluntary contributions by parents, or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme, are permissible provided that it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.</P>

	<P>My Department has given a very high priority to the provision of resources to address the learning difficulties of children with low levels of achievement in reading such as those referred to by the Deputy.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department implemented a general allocation system in all primary schools with effect from the start of the 2005/2006 school year.  The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs including dyslexia.</P>
        <P>Second level pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support from the remedial/learning support teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.  My Department allocates additional teacher support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and Vocational Education Committees to cater for pupils with special educational needs, including, where appropriate, pupils with dyslexia.  I have no plans to change the current criteria for accessing additional resource teaching support for students with dyslexia.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Primary schools&rsquo; running costs are met by my Department&rsquo;s scheme of capitation grants.  These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges.  The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil to &euro;145.58 with effect from 1st January, 2006.  Schools with between 100 and 150 pupils would receive a capitation grant based on these rates.  This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997. </P><Col N="1601"/>
        <P>Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from &euro;400.00 to &euro;619.50 per pupil.  The standard rate of capitation grant is paid to all primary schools except Gaelscoileanna located outside of Gaeltacht areas which receive an additional &euro;25.39 per pupil over and above the standard rate grant.</P>
        <P>The capitation grant is in addition to the Ancillary Services Grant which provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.  The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme was increased from &euro;102 per pupil in 2002 to the current rate of &euro;139 per pupil.  Schools with between 100 and 150 pupils would receive the Ancillary Services Grant based on these rates.</P>
        <P>There have also been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools in recent years.  Since January 2005, the standard per capita grant has been increased by a cumulative &euro;24 per pupil and now stands at &euro;298 per pupil.  In addition, secondary schools have also benefited from grants introduced under the School Services Support Fund initiative.  Under this initiative, a minimum payment grant of &euro;40,688, based on 200 pupils, is paid to schools with 200 pupils or less.  This payment brings overall funding towards the running costs including secretarial and caretaking provision in the case of a school with 150 pupils to &euro;85,388 per annum.  This Government has shown a strong commitment to improving school funding in recent years and I will continue to prioritise this area in the context of available resources.</P>

	<P>The Youthreach Programme is an Inter-Departmental initiative which provides two years integrated education, training and work experience to young people aged 15-20 years who are at least six months in the labour market and who have left school early without any qualifications or vocational training.</P>
        <P>The programme funded by my Department is delivered in out of school centres and is managed by Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  There are a total of ninety Youthreach Centres managed by the VEC sector throughout the country. Overall, there are about 6,500 places available nationally at present, 3,200 of which are in the VEC sector and the remainder in Community Training Centres under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>Basic skills training, practical work training and general education are features of the programme, and the application of new technology is integrated into all aspects of programme content.  The programme provides a strong emphasis on personal development, on the core skills of literacy/numeracy, communications and IT, along with a choice of vocational options such as Catering, Hairdressing, Computers, Woodwork, Photography, Video, Sports, Art and craft and a work experience programme.</P>

	<P>The national adult literacy services are delivered by the Vocational Education Committees with funding provided by my Department.  The disbursement of adult literacy funds is a matter for each VEC, which, subject to its budget, decides the nature of the service to be provided in its area and the man<Col N="1603"/>ner in which the funds should be spent.  In addition to the standard service, some VECs use some of their funds to provide specially-targeted literacy programmes, including family literacy.</P>

        <Quest> if, in regard to her address to the INTO conference on 18 April 2006, she will indicate the manner in which standardised tests inform policy making at national level by providing invaluable information regarding attainment levels in schools here, or allow parents to judge their child&rsquo;s progress against the national norm in view of the fact that her Department does not collate the results of school tests; if her Department intends to collate the results of all schools&rsquo; standardised tests; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A standardised test measures how a pupil performs at the time of the test in relation to what is expected for a pupil of that age or class.</P>
<P>Test results can be used at school level to identify pupils with learning difficulties at an early stage so that support and interventions can be put in place.  While standardised tests do not indicate the nature of a learning difficulty, they can be used to flag potential difficulties and to prompt further assessment. </P>
<P>Also, an item by item analysis of the child&rsquo;s performance on a standardised test can help a teacher identify areas of particular difficulty for the child. Test results, therefore, when used with information gleaned from other assessment measures, can help teachers and parents with a full picture of the child&rsquo;s progress and, in so <Col N="1604"/>doing, guide the teaching and learning process in a very meaningful way.</P>
        <P>At classroom level, information from standardised tests can be particularly useful in informing individual and group teaching.</P>
<P>Standardised tests also have an important role to play at the level of the whole school.  They provide valuable information for teachers, principals and boards of management when engaging in self-evaluation, a vitally important stage in planning the development and improvement of the individual school.</P>
        <P>These are the reasons why I believe that standardised testing, as one of a range of modes of assessment and carried out on a systematic basis, has real potential to enhance the quality of teaching and learning for our pupils at classroom level, and to provide valuable information for parents about their children&rsquo;s learning.</P>
        <P>I intend to make standardised testing at the end of first class, or the beginning of second, and at the end of fourth class, or beginning of fifth, a requirement.  However, it is not my attention that these test results will be collated on a national basis.  Instead, the results will be retained at school level and be available to inspectors conducting evaluations.  As I have indicated many times already, inspectors&rsquo; reports will not contain data that might facilitate school comparisons or the compilation of league tables.</P>
<P>To meet the need for national data, I intend to introduce a separate programme of national monitoring.  This will enable trend data on pupil achievement in different categories of school to be compiled using rigorously constructed samples of schools.  The outcomes of this process will be used into monitoring the effectiveness of national policies and programmes.</P>
        <P>It is not my Department&rsquo;s intention to use test results obtained during the national monitoring to compile school league tables.  Neither will they be used, as a stand-alone criterion, in the allocation of resources to individual pupils or individual schools or in the measurement of the effectiveness of the teachers and schools that form part of the samples.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently finalising the arrangements for introduction of the introduction of standardised testing as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The DEIS plan states that as well as pro<Col N="1606"/>vision being made for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools, not identified for inclusion in the DEIS initiative, where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</P>
        <P>DEIS is designed to ensure that the schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available. Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in the DEIS initiative and which are receiving additional resources, both human and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage, will retain these supports for 2006/2007. After that, schools will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review processes, 873 schools have been invited to participate in the new Programme. These comprise 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>Grants due to the 670 Primary schools which are participating in the DEIS initiative will be lodged to their schools&rsquo; bank accounts on 17 November 2006. This is in addition to payments totalling &euro;1 million which issued to those schools in June 2006. Provision is also been made for the issue of grants in the case of the 203 Post Primary schools which are participating in the initiative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, approximately another 2,000 schools will receive rates of grant assistance to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage, including those that are benefiting from previous schemes.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that last year I launched a new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), one aspect of which will be more staffing for the most disadvantaged schools.   The plan provides for an extra 300 posts across the education system over the course of the five year implementation period.</P>
        <P>I expect that approximately 180 extra posts will have been created in primary and post-primary schools by the end of the 2006/07 school year in the new DEIS initiative in order to benefit schools from measures which range from supports for tackling children&rsquo;s literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, allocation of administrative principals on lower enrolment, measures to strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community and support services for the <Col N="1623"/>provision of continuous professional development for teachers.</P>

	<P>My Department has in the past operated a number of schemes to tackle educational disadvantage and reduce class sizes in schools in disadvantaged areas. These existing schemes are being integrated into the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) which I launched last year, one aspect of which will be more staffing for the most disadvantaged schools. Under the plan, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in the 190 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Participating schools in the Giving Children an Even Break programme, which was launched in 2001, were supported to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes.  The Breaking the Cycle project, which was launched in 1996, provided staffing supports to implement maximum class size of 15: 1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes for 32 schools in designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Prior to that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, which was launched in 1984, benefited participating schools by providing ex-quota concessionary posts which were not determined by reference to enrolment.  The recommended guideline for the maximum class size for schools that were designated disadvantaged was 29:1.  When a designated disadvantaged school exceeded this guideline an additional mainstream teaching post, referred to as a maximum class size post, was sanctioned by my Department.</P>
        <P>Class reductions in the 32 schools under the Breaking the Cycle project and in 211 schools under the Giving Children an Even Break will also continue in operation in the schools concerned. Schools that were allocated the services of ex-quota concessionary teachers under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme also retain their entitlements to these posts.</P>

	<P>The new school to which the Deputy refers was provided by my Department to meet the growing need for extra primary provision in the area in September, 2005.</P>
        <P>When fully occupied, the school will operate as a two-stream 16-classroom school. To enable it develop in this manner, it can only enrol two junior infant classes annually. This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over enrolment in the early stages and crucially, to ensure that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this position and as an exceptional matter, the school has been given approval to enrol three junior infant classes for this school year on the grounds that this will not impact negatively on the other schools in question.  While enrolment policies are a matter for school authorities, the Department expects the enrolment polices of individual schools to compliment the demand for pupil places in an area and, as in this case, to assist the growth of the new school in an orderly fashion. This is in the best interests of the schools, pupils and wider community alike.</P>
        <P>Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In part<Col N="1627"/>icular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>

        <P>The target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; was defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.

        <P>Many significant lessons are learned from the wide range of exercises, which are conducted on an ongoing basis. These include: the need for proper debriefings and a structured lessons learned process, the need to manage the provision of information to the public and the media, and the need to keep plans up-to-date.  Also, regular exercises prove hugely important in identifying gaps and weaknesses and clarifying issues in relation to roles and responsibilities for responding to a particular emergency situation.</P>

	<P>The White Paper on Defence outlines the blue print for a new Reserve Defence Force. The new Reserve will have a clearly defined role, an enhanced relationship with the PDF, better equipment and training and opportunities to serve on overseas peace support missions.</P>
        <P>The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan, which was formally launched in July 2004, is progressing on schedule and the challenges presented by the plan are being met. This plan provides for the phased enhancement of Reserve capabilities over the period to end <Col N="1629"/>2009. To date the Reserve has been reorganised along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force with three Brigades, a Reserve Defence Force Training Authority located in the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh and a dedicated Naval Service Reserve. These new organisational structures were introduced on 1st October 2005. In addition to the reorganisation, the Reserve has seen significant improvements in clothing, equipment and enhanced training opportunities.</P>
        <P>The development of the integrated element of the Reserve is currently being progressed and it is planned to introduce elements of the integrated Reserve, on a pilot basis, in 2007.  This element of the Reserve will provide personnel who will integrate with PDF units in contingency situations. The Integrated Reserve will be provided with enhanced military training and PDF unit commanders will be responsible for the training of such Reserve personnel.</P>
        <P>The phased enhancement of Reserve capabilities and improvements in interoperability between the Reserve and the PDF, as provided for in the plan, are significant enablers in facilitating any future participation by Reserve personnel in overseas peace support missions.</P>
        <P>While there are no immediate plans for participation by members of the Reserve in overseas missions, policies to support the selection of suitably qualified personnel for overseas duties will be developed over the lifetime of the Implementation Plan i.e. over the period to end 2009.  In other countries, service by Reservists on overseas peace support missions is quite common, although as specified in the Plan, any such participation by members of the Reserve is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services. This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate advance training.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces, in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.</P><Col N="1630"/>
        <P>In effect this means that women are eligible on the same basis as men for participation in operational and ceremonial activities, for assignment to all military appointments, for  educational and training courses, and for promotion. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts. All applicants for service in the Defence Forces, both male and female, are interviewed on an equal basis and then placed in order of merit. It is not possible to give one gender priority over another as this would result in an equality issue.</P>
        <P>All competition selection boards and general service interview boards are briefed on equality issues and specifically in relation to gender and diversity issues. All new entrants into the Defence Forces receive training during induction on equality and interpersonal relationships and on redress systems. All career courses and leadership seminars contain modules on equality and interpersonal relationships. All instructors are briefed on bullying and discrimination, and there is an instruction guiding instructors and students alike.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have no restrictions or barriers to females serving in any appointment or in any rank. Selection and promotion is based on merit. Female strength levels in the Permanent Defence Force have increased from 4.4% of overall strength in 2001 to 5.23% of overall strength at the end of October 2006. In total there are currently 551 female personnel serving in the Permanent Defence Force.  Over the past nine years, the strength of female personnel in the Permanent Defence Force has increased from 244 at the end of 1997 to 551 at present. This constitutes an increase of over 100% in the number of females serving over this period.</P>
        <P>The government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. I am, however, most anxious to ensure that every potential avenue for increasing the number of women applying to join and serve in the Defence Forces is maximised, within the framework of the Government policy of equal opportunity.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I have with effect from 1st September 2006 reduced the minimum height requirement for entry into both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force from 162.56cm (5&rsquo;4&rdquo;) to 157.48cm (5&rsquo;2&rdquo;).</P>
        <P>This change, which applies to both males and females, has the effect of increasing the annual recruitment pool of females from 60% to 90% and males from 97% to 98%. It is too early to gauge whether there has been a corresponding increase in the number of female applicants to the Defence Forces. However, I will closely monitor the situation over the coming months.</P><Col N="1631"/>
        <P>I must point out that height is not the only issue in encouraging more women to apply to join the Defence Forces and I have recently initiated more general research in this area. To this end, following a tendering process, TNS MRBI an independent market research company has been awarded the contract to undertake research into the issue of the recruitment and retention of women in the Defence Forces. The research will test women&rsquo;s attitudes to military life and to a career in the Defence Forces. The research, which has already commenced, will include interviews with currently serving female members of both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force and with members of the general public. The results of the research will inform policy in this area for the future. TNS MRBI is due to complete the research by the end of 2006 with the finalised report due in early 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 228 and 230 together.</P>
        <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 31 October 2006, the latest date for which detailed figures are available, as advised by the military authorities was 10,357. A detailed breakdown of the numbers in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by rank and gender are set out in the following Tabular Statement.  The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.  It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs. The Defence Forces continue to have a proactive approach to all aspects of recruiting.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces manage recruit intakes to keep its annualised monthly average strength at or around 10,500.  The strength of the Defence Forces as at 31 December in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively was 10,498, 10,551 and 10,446.  There is a planned total intake of 255 personnel (Cadets, Apprentices &amp; General Enlistment) before the end of 2006, with an expected outflow of 150 personnel in the same period.  Recruit intake will be finalised in December 2006 to ensure that the annualised monthly average strength is at or around 10,500.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence provides for an allocation of up to 850 Permanent Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas at any one time through the United Nations Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS).  While this may be exceeded for short periods, deployments above this level are not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources.  Any commitments to EU or UN missions will be met within this context. Currently, there are 821 Defence Forces personnel deployed on overseas operations. There are no plans to increase the numbers serving in the Defence Forces above the levels provided for in the White Paper.</P>
        <P>The Naval Service has a fleet of eight vessels, two of which are classed as Coastal Patrol Vessels (CPV). All the ships include coastal areas in their patrol patterns. The fleet completes around 1680 patrol days per annum and, on a daily basis, an average of over four naval vessels are deployed on patrol throughout the year. The ships carry radar and Automatic Identification System (AIS) receptors on board and use these to monitor activity around them. They are supported from the Naval Base by the Fishery Monitoring System which tracks fishing vessel activity.  The Naval Service has met the requirements of its operational tasking to date.</P><Col N="1635"/>

	<P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting their members in dealing with Nuclear, Biological or Chemical (NBC) threats should such arise. They hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements. This range includes approximately 9,500 NBC suits, of which 800 were delivered in January 2006. In addition, the Defence Forces has sufficient stock of Respirators for each individual soldier. They also have 98 of the most technologically up to date Chemical Agent Monitors and Defence Forces personnel have been trained on their operation. Other equipment on hands includes Biological Agent Detector and Screening Kits, Group Decontamination Equipment and Personal Decontamination Equipment.  The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Defence Forces. A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased expeditiously to meet the changing requirements.</P><Col N="1637"/>
        <P>The Deputy specifically refers to body armour. In that regard, a tender competition was held in 2005 for the provision of body armour for the individual soldier on operational duties. An order has now been placed for 6000 units for delivery this year. The new body armour provides significantly greater protection, comfort and coverage than the old model as well as a doubling of the range of sizes available.</P>

	<P>Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that, where an estate is completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission, the planning authority must initiate taking in charge procedures as soon as may be following a request do so by the developer or by the majority of the owners or occupiers.  Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning auth<Col N="1639"/>ority has not taken enforcement action within the appropriate period, the planning authority must also initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by the owners/occupiers.  The decision as whether any particular estate should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the planning authority.  </P>

	<P>The information requested is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>My Department is conscious of the escalating costs to local authorities of operating the substantially increased network of recycling facilities. This is reflected in increased funding of &euro;8m from the Environment Fund in 2006 in respect of such operational costs. The costs incurred by local authorities are regularly reviewed to ensure that the available funding is distributed in an equitable manner.</P><Col N="1639"/>

	<P>The first two reports on local authority service indicators in respect of 2004 and 2005 were published by the Local Government Management Services Board in mid 2005 and 2006 respectively.  I consider that it is too early at this stage to establish trends in individual local authority performance on the lines suggested in the Question, although the trends overall as shown in the 2005 report are moving in the right direction.  I have, however,  asked each local authority to review its own performance across the range of indicators and in the light of the performance by other local authorities. In addition I have also requested them to <Col N="1642"/>reflect on any disparities and variations in the results contained in the two reports to date and to put in place strategies to ensure their own performance is improved on an ongoing basis, if necessary.</P>

	<P>In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority.  It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.  In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register, which included a commitment to provide additional ring-fenced financial resources to support local authorities&rsquo; own spending in respect of the register campaign.  I advised authorities that a contribution of some &euro;6 million can be made available in this regard.  An initial allocation of some &euro;3 million, based on the number of households in each local authority area, was made available in July to local authorities for registration work, with the balance of this funding to be made available following completion of the registration work.</P>
        <P>As regards publicity and awareness, a two-stage approach has been developed, involving  information notices followed by an intensive <Col N="1643"/>media campaign.  Information notices were published in the national press on 19-21 August, urging co-operation with local register campaigns.  In addition, a national publicity and awareness campaign involving TV, radio, press and outdoor advertising commenced on 11 September and will run until 25 November (the closing date for submitting corrections to the Draft Register).  Following a competitive tender process, Young Euro RSCG were appointed  to undertake a publicity and awareness campaign in relation to the Register.  Some &euro;1 million is being spent on the campaign. This is additional to the funding being provided to local authorities.  I have already indicated that, in addition to short-term action to improve the quality of the Register, I am open to consideration of longer options for change in this regard on a consensus basis.</P>
