      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Not only did the national development plan advertisement campaign feature two full-page advertisements in all newspapers, but the population at large was exposed to the visages of a number of Ministers, particularly the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister <Col N="2"/>for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin. While I realise it is difficult to separate on a consistent basis Government from actions of Government and developments that take place around the country, and there are occasions where they become inseparable, in cases where <Col N="3"/>the Government was sending out the message about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This question refers specifically to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It does, but it is party to the advertisement. Sometimes these issues are inseparable. Two full page advertisements in all newspapers were used to put out the message. How much did that cost? Was the cross-departmental team on public private partnerships, which includes the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, involved in drawing up the advertisements? Is there a genuine value in using the faces of Ministers on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This question refers specifically to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I could reverse the question, if the Ceann Comhairle wishes to be technical. Is there any value in the advertisements in the absence of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s face? The Taoiseach will be aware, on the basis of cases raised previously, especially those involving Ministers of State, that there is clearly potential for abuse in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is going way outside the scope of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That may not be the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention. I raise this issue because if the public is to be informed about developments under the national development plan, including those led by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, it is not necessary to insert Ministers&rsquo; faces in the advertisements for which the public pays. Perhaps he will respond to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The national development plan advertisements are not placed by my Department. I issued a circular on the appropriateness and inappropriateness of advertisements during the last session, which should be adhered to. Nobody bothered to put my face on the list of advertisements placed by my Department and I was not upset about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not need to put the Taoiseach&rsquo;s face on them, as he is known well enough at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not too sure that makes much difference to the advertisements.</P>
        <P>Criteria, which are fair, are laid down for public information advertisements. The advertisements are placed for public information and not propaganda purposes. If those who design the advertisements feel they should include a Department&rsquo;s title or logo or a photograph, that is all right but they should not be used for anything else. The main criterion is they should be seen as <Col N="4"/>public information rather than a means of promoting of somebody, which is fair. I may be corrected but, having looked through the list of advertisements placed by my Department, I very much doubt that my name even appears on them. Unless it is necessary, that should not happen. Each Department deals with the advertisements and not the cross-departmental team.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the advertisements should be about public information. However, from the Opposition&rsquo;s point of view, the advertisements could be restructured so that Ministers would state the items they have not yet delivered under the national development plan, which are seven years behind schedule, and which they propose to undertake over the next 18 months.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Taoiseach says about the absence of any necessity to portray himself in these advertisements. I am only grateful he does not commission a stamp commemorating himself while he is still in office, as there is no need for it.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach wrote to me recently about this issue. With regard to the criteria he set out, are procedures in place to monitor compliance? An issue can arise because of a particular event or Minister or Minister of State. On an ongoing basis, are there procedures to monitor compliance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I brought this issue to the attention of every Minister, Minister of State and Department. A notification was also circulated by the Standards in Public Office Commission. Ministers should follow the commission&rsquo;s request and that, on its own, should determine that people stay within the guidelines.</P>

        <Quest>if he will report on his 22 March 2006 meeting with Mr. Raymond McCord concerning the murder of Mr. <Col N="5"/>McCord&rsquo;s son in 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I met Mr. Raymond McCord on 22 March in Government Buildings. This meeting followed a series of meetings between Mr. McCord and officials from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs. I expressed my sympathy to Mr. McCord and his family on the loss of his son, Raymond. Since his son&rsquo;s brutal murder in November 1997, Mr. McCord has been extremely brave in his determined efforts to get justice. Following my meeting with Mr. McCord, I raised the case with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair when I met him in Armagh on 6 April.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>This is a deeply worrying case. It centres on the possible involvement of loyalist paramilitaries who may also have been police informers in the murder of Raymond McCord, as well as in other murders. It is clear that the matter requires the fullest investigation. A report by the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland has already been prepared and was sent to the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland last October. The outcome of deliberations in that office, are currently awaited. I welcome the Adjournment debate about the case that took place in this House last October. Deputy Rabbitte asked me previously to meet Mr. McCord. We will continue to follow developments in this case very closely. In this context, the report of the Police Ombudsman will be very important when it becomes publicly available, as will any decision by the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the persons allegedly responsible for the murder of Raymond McCord in 1997 were members of the UVF and were also agents of the RUC special branch? Is he aware that the same persons are strongly suspected of having been responsible for the attempted bombing of a Sinn F&eacute;in office in Monaghan around the same time? That office acts as my constituency office to this day. Is the Taoiseach aware that one of the agents is believed to have been responsible for a number of killings while he was an active special branch agent? Does the Taoiseach agree that all of these pointers suggest that the spectre of the RUC and the British system in the North will always seek to protect its own at any cost and that is what we are witnessing in the terrible murder of Raymond McCord? Does the Taoiseach accept that it is vitally important that the Government acts in every way possible to assist the family of the late Mr. McCord, given that his father courageously crossed the political divide and that across the island in the pursuit of truth and justice for his son? Does the Taoiseach agree that it is therefore all the more important and incumbent on the <Col N="6"/>Government to exercise itself in every way possible in this case?</P>
        <P>In his initial reply to the question, the Taoiseach stated that he raised the matter in his meeting with the British Prime Minister in Armagh on April 6. Can he elaborate on that? What exactly does &ldquo;raising the matter&rdquo; mean? Has he asked the British Prime Minister to initiate a full inquiry into the murder of Raymond McCord, given the extent of the information to hand, accepting that there has been and may well continue to be a flow of information from current and former serving officers in the police <i>et al</i> which confirms the collusion involved in this terrible act? I would appreciate the Taoiseach&rsquo;s elaboration on his engagement with the British Prime Minister on 6 April.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the issues raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in but, although they may prove to be factual, the Deputy will understand that I cannot stand over the facts at this stage. However, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Ms O&rsquo;Loan, has investigated the details to an enormous degree and has elaborated on them in a report she prepared over some months. That report is with the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland who has been considering it for the past six months. We will have to await the outcome of that process. Most of the facts noted by the Deputy have been stated here or by Mr. McCord and others.</P>
        <P>On the question of assistance to Mr. McCord from the Irish Government, we have held a number of meetings with him over the past six months and officials of my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs will maintain contact with him and will continue to monitor the situation. When I met him on 22 March, I said that my officials would contact him to offer any assistance they could. I also told him that, in terms of seeking a public inquiry, it was best to await the outcome of Ms O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s report and the statement of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I told him, based on the facts as I know them and subject to their substantiation in Ms O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s report, which I have not seen, we would support him in seeking an inquiry. However, I told him that it would be best for the reports to be first entered into the public domain by the DPP and Ms O&rsquo;Loan, which I understand will happen in the normal course of events. It is important that this is done at the appropriate time and based on the situation.</P>
        <P>The facts are disturbing and Mr. McCord outlined the details to me at a number of meetings. He is a tremendously brave individual, a quality which has not been without problems for him. I will not elaborate on that but I admire him and think he deserves support for that reason. As I have promised to Deputy Rabbitte some months ago, we will continue to help him.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to meet Ray McCord but want to pursue one aspect of the matter. When I initially raised the matter in an Adjournment debate on 27 October, I understood that the publication of the report of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland was imminent. However, the Taoiseach is now saying that it has been referred to the DPP. Can the Taoiseach tell the House when it is likely to enter the public domain? I am unsure, in a case where a report is sent to the DPP for possible prosecution, whether the report as compiled by the ombudsman is entered into the public domain.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach know whether any of the people against whom these serious allegations were made continue to serve as police officers or members of the Northern Ireland security forces?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not know precisely when the report will enter the public domain but I understand from a number of sources that it will do so within the coming weeks and by some time in May. I am unsure whether that estimate is based on the fact the DPP will make a decision or on a time gap. It is seven months since the report went to the DPP. I do not know whether the issue is time or if it is a call the ombudsman can make. Although I have not heard it from the ombudsman, I have heard that it is expected.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, the allegations are not against any serving members at this stage. As the Deputy knows from his own meetings, there is an intricate list of people and connections relating to the murders of Mr. McCord and many others. We will have to wait for the report before we will know how many are involved and what the relationship with the old RUC was. Although it is quite a number of people, none of them are serving now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach already promised to seek a full investigation into the murder of Mr. McCord. He promised to meet Mr. Blair at the fringes of the European Council meeting at the end of March. Did the Taoiseach not meet him there but in Armagh instead, or did he meet him a second time to discuss this matter? In his reply the Taoiseach mentions Armagh only. Can the Taoiseach indicate what is in the preliminary report and if so, does he expect the special branch detectives, who ran the UVF informants, to face prosecution? If this happens, has the Taoiseach thought about how any effect on the peace process would be addressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The meeting I mentioned was the meeting with the Prime Minister in Armagh to make him aware of our concerns about the case. On 9 November 1997, Mr. McCord&rsquo;s body was found in Ballyduff Quarry in Newtownabbey after he had been beaten to death by loyalist paramilitaries. He was a 22 year old Protestant <Col N="8"/>resident of north Belfast and his father has fought his case since then. Since last year British Irish Rights Watch compiled and sent the report on the case to the United Nations, the Police Ombudsman, the Independent Monitoring Commission, the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the US special envoy in Northern Ireland and the US Congress. The report names individuals believed to be implicated in the murder. It has not been published because it names people. That issue must be examined. Mr. McCord&rsquo;s father has lobbied political parties and others North and South for support in this issue. We just have to wait to see how the process evolves. The case is important for many reasons and is being watched closely in Northern Ireland.</P>

        <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Easter Rising of 1916 was commemorated by a military parade in Dublin on Sunday, 16 April 2006. Approximately 2,500 personnel representing all branches of the Permanent Defence Force together with representatives of ex-service personnel and veterans of UN service were included. The parade also included members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, representing their service abroad with the United Nations and the Garda Band. There were a number of aerial fly pasts by the Air Corps.</P>
        <P>The parade departed Dublin Castle, passed through Dame Street, College Green and O&rsquo;Connell Street. There was a reading of the Proclamation outside the GPO, appropriate military honours were rendered and the President laid a wreath in memory of all those who lost their lives. As is normal for State occasions of this nature, such as the national day of commemoration, the diplomatic corps was invited.</P>
        <P>It has been the practice to invite representatives from all walks of life in Northern Ireland to State occasions. This is a gesture of both friendship and respect. As such, all MLAs, including Unionists, were welcome to attend the parade on Easter Sunday. However, in advance of the event no Unionist representative indicated a wish to attend, and the Government fully respected that position.</P>
        <P>The 90th anniversary of the Rising was also marked by a wreath laying in Kilmainham Gaol earlier that morning and by a Government reception at Dublin Castle that evening. A newly prepared exhibition relating to the Rising is being presented by the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks. The official opening of this presentation was on Sunday, 9 April and it continues through the summer. A special commemorative stamp was issued by An Post on Wednesday, 12 April to mark the 90th anniversary.</P>
        <P>My Department chaired an interdepartmental working group which oversaw all the logistical arrangements for the day. This group included representatives of the Office of Public Works, the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs, as well as the Defence Forces, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council, RTE, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Festival and the fire services. I take this opportunity to thank all those involved behind the scenes for their professionalism in the organisation of the event and for a job well done.</P>
        <P>I am sure Members will agree the parade was a wonderful spectacle and in addition to the thousands of people who watched it on the streets of Dublin, it was also watched by hundreds of thousands of people on television. As Deputies will be aware, all parties in the House have nominated <Col N="10"/>spokespersons to offer advice on the appropriate scope and content of a 1916 centenary commemoration programme to be put in place in the coming years. The inaugural meeting of the Oireachtas group held on 1 March was mainly concerned with the arrangements for the 90th anniversary commemorations this year. Further meetings of the group in the months to come will address the possible arrangements to commemorate the centenary.</P>
        <P>This year is also the 90th anniversary of the battle of the Somme, the attack having been launched on 1 July 1916. Details of arrangements to mark the occasion will be announced closer to that time. The 100th anniversary of the death of Michael Davitt will be commemorated by the issuing of a stamp in September 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the commemoration of 1916 was a successful occasion. While I had to remind the Taoiseach of the necessity for inclusiveness in the work of all politicians in the run-up to that celebration, the conduct on Easter Sunday was entirely apolitical and provided an opportunity for a demonstration by the Defence Forces and an opportunity for them to be thanked for the service they have given to the country at home and abroad.</P>
        <P>This morning the <i>Irish Independent </i>carried a report that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is running with the idea that the GPO should be closed as a post office and transformed into some type of museum of the 1916 Rising. Has this idea been put before Cabinet or has a decision been made in this regard? Is it the intention of Government to hold an annual 1916 commemoration ceremony in the run-up to the centenary, given that the Taoiseach quite rightly called for a national conversation, as it is called, in this regard? I am sure there are people with imagination and creativity throughout the country who have ideas about how the centenary should finally be celebrated in a country that will have survived and stood the test of 100 years at that stage. Will the Taoiseach comment on this?</P>
        <P>As was stated to me on Sunday, whatever else might be said about the members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, the Irish Army, it still retains absolute neatness and gives a lesson to everybody on how to shine shoes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his comments on the commemoration. No decision has been made on the GPO or other suggestions. These matters are best discussed within the committee. It has been mooted by a number of people that the GPO could and should be used, either in part or in full, not just as a museum of 1916 but as a museum of the past 100 years or further back. There are many creative people who would bring forward ideas. I would like to encourage work to be expedited, since I know how long it can take. <Col N="11"/>Everyone will say that it is ten years away and that we are in no hurry. However, owing to the processes involved, if we do not move along, it might never happen. Over the next few years, people must put great effort into whatever projects we plan for the centenary so that we can have them finished in time rather than starting them at that stage, which would be a pity. Every year I would like all those involved with the interdepartmental committee, as well as Members of the Oireachtas, to express their views.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>We should have some commemoration every year. Perhaps this year we should reflect on whether it is possible or sensible for it to be precisely the same and to see how we might organise it best. I have an open mind on whether to embrace other matters each year as we approach the centenary. Whatever we do, we should use the run-up to the centenary to ensure that we get things right, since it is a very important day, not only for the country but internationally. It should be tried and tested, and doing that will take some time.</P>
        <P>I am sure that there will be imaginative ideas. Perhaps we should put a few years&rsquo; effort into them, agree on something and have it done. As I have said to those involved in the various agencies and Departments, we should try to finalise arrangements by 2016 rather than have a blueprint that will be finished in 2026.</P>

	<P>I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I might make one brief point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that I had communicated to him that the Sinn F&eacute;in president and I would be unable to attend the Easter Sunday event because of prior commitments, a reality far removed from speculation in some newspapers that we had somehow absented ourselves? Our party was officially represented by at least two Deputies, two MPs and one MEP, amply indicating our intent to be fully involved and support the event, and I communicated that to the Taoiseach in writing in advance.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the best way to honour the men and women of 1916 would be to strive for full implementation of the Proclamation and the hopes and promise thus embodied? Does he agree that foremost on a list of objectives derived naturally therefrom would be earnest and proactive work for Irish reunification and the unity of our peoples on this island? Should that be a clear objective of this and future Governments and something towards which they should strive?</P><Col N="12"/>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach act on the Sinn F&eacute;in proposals regarding the establishment of an all-party Oireachtas committee on Irish unity that would plan for Irish reunification, assessing the implications and needs to be addressed in the course of moving towards that objective, a transition to Irish unity? In that regard, will the Taoiseach commission a Green Paper on Irish unity before the current D&aacute;il ends, something for which Sinn F&eacute;in have consistently argued?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should confine himself to questions, since we are running out of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a question. I ask whether the Taoiseach will initiate a Green Paper on Irish unity based on the widest possible consultation and participation before the end of the current D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify recent unconfirmed reports that consideration is being given to re-interring the remains of the 1916 leaders from Arbour Hill to Glasnevin cemetery? There has been speculation about this and it is important the position of the Government and the Taoiseach on this is clarified. My view is that it should not happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to confine himself to the question. Four Deputies are offering and I want to try to facilitate them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that now that Arbour Hill is fully open and accessible to all and is a fitting place to pay homage to those who gave their lives in 1916, those interred there should remain there?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s last point, I have heard no speculation. It certainly did not come from any of the issues with which I dealt. Arbour Hill is the resting ground of the leaders of the 1916 Rising and I cannot think why anybody would want to change that. I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the Good Friday Agreement as I spend a huge amount of my time trying to do that.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked me to acknowledge that I knew he would not be at the Easter Sunday event. He informed me of that and of who would stand in. Even if I was criticised for where I made the original announcement, I gave everybody seven months&rsquo; notice. It was a good day to pay tribute to &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, in particular, but it is a matter for everybody whether&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Taoiseach that I did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="13"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for everybody whether they can attend events. I confirm the Deputy told me he would not be there and that he would be represented by another Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it not breathtaking hypocrisy for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government to pretend to honour those who fought in 1916 when the Proclamation for which they fought, although certainly not a socialist document despite the presence of the great socialist, James Connolly, asserted the ownership of Ireland by the people? Does it not fly completely in the face of the spirit of that that his Government is divesting key assets of Ireland and the ownership of those assets from the people to international speculators? This has happened with the telecoms industry and the Government proposes to do the same with the national airline. It has destroyed the national sugar beet industry by giving it to national and international speculators.</P>
        <P>As he stood at the GPO on Easter Sunday and thought of men and women who went out to overthrow imperialist domination of Ireland, a small country, did the Taoiseach not consider the irony that he and his Government are facilitating a similar domination by other major powers, namely, the US and Britain which have invaded and occupied Iraq? Is the Government wrapping the banner of 1916 around itself utterly opportunistic in view of its policies over the past nine years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked three questions. I totally disagree with him on the first question, even more so on the second one and fundamentally on the third one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Joe Higgins has a clear position on this issue. I am bound to say that in the case of Sinn F&eacute;in, it was a mistake for the ard comhairle to decide its president would not be present. I pay tribute to the performance of the Defence Forces. I am not sure it would be appropriate to have the same type of commemoration of the event each year between now and the centenary. I understand the Taoiseach stated he has an open mind on that matter. Perhaps it should be the subject of cross-party discussion before a decision is made.</P>
        <P>Has the Government plans to mark the 90th anniversary of the First D&aacute;il? Will the Taoiseach comment on the apparent discrepancy between his speech and the website of his office in terms of marking the foundation of this State? Most of us in this House regard the origins of the House as the 1919 meeting of the First D&aacute;il in the Mansion House, and that that is the foundation point of this State. I ask the Taoiseach to comment on that.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach think it inadequate to mark the centenary of the death of Michael <Col N="14"/>Davitt merely with the production of a commemorative stamp? Having regard to Davitt&rsquo;s contribution to the history of this country, the land wars and especially the struggle in my part of the country, the mere production of a stamp to commemorate the centenary of his death is inadequate. I urge the Government to look at the issue between now and later in the year. The centenary occurs on 31 May and the Government should consider the matter again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the centenary of Michael Davitt&rsquo;s death, there will be a week of commemorative activities in the last days of May and the early days of June. Relevant people have been in touch with my Department with regard to support for the commemoration programme. There will be a conference commemorating the centenary, the Army is involved and there will be a number of other events. I cannot recall the exact support we have given, but my Department&rsquo;s commemorative division has been in discussions with the people involved. The stamp is one of the initiatives and it is separate from the planned week of activities. The relevant committee requested that the stamp be brought forward, and that will be done later in the year.</P>
        <P>Some years ago, on one of the anniversaries of the First D&aacute;il, I brought all the families, relatives and parties together in Dublin Castle for an evening, which was important at the time. Since then, a number of the people involved have died. Only a certain number of events can be held this year. There are three big events, those relating to 1916 and the Battle of the Somme and our national day of commemoration. That is the broad commemoration that includes all the events. There is some work on other commemorations, such as the centenary of Michael Davitt&rsquo;s death.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with any of these events. Five years ago we held the commemoration of the First D&aacute;il. The Deputy will appreciate that in any one year only a few such events can be held and these should be dealt with correctly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity for the commemoration. The Green Party was particularly mindful of the need for the Proclamation to be a reference point for the way this nation is developing and that it must do considerably more to live up to the expectations of those who fought and the many who died in 1916. As Deputy Rabbitte said, the Taoiseach should consider that the prospect of ongoing military parades between now and 2016 might be too narrow in terms of the breadth of vision evident from those who took part in the 1916 Rising. Would it be useful to refer to different aspects of the Proclamation to be used as themes in the run up to 2016 taking into account the emphasis on equal rights? It would even be useful to reflect upon the sover<Col N="15"/>eignty aspect as mentioned by Deputy Joe Higgins. The suffrage of men and women and how&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A brief question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to be positive and I will be brief. In suggesting the events and the inclusiveness that should mark those events, did the Taoiseach have any expectation that he would give rise to the Roman Catholic church and the Church of Ireland debating fundamental theological reconciliation? I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on the Arbour Hill ceremonies in future. These have not been marked by ecumenical characteristics, which might be worth reviewing as we are asked to review the events.</P>
        <P>Could the Taoiseach acknowledge that the men and women in 1916 felt as strongly about the Irish language and its relationship to sovereignty as they did about the colour of the flag flying over the GPO? In this regard, I ask him to emphasise this in his future statements. B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhf&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh go d&aacute;theangach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously I share Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s view of Michael Davitt as a driving force behind the one of first great European agrarian movements. The Government could consider a number of matters beyond issuing a stamp. The Taoiseach spoke about the GPO, which has functioned as a working post office since 1818. I would not favour it being transformed into a museum. However, the outgoing chief executive officer told me on Sunday that the space behind the existing building could be transformed into a fabulous atrium dedicated to 1916, which should be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach might be able to answer this question. I saw a very interesting documentary, I believe on TG4, about the executions of the leaders of 1916. Of all the courts martial the only missing file was that of &Eacute;amon de Valera. I wonder where it went.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said that the President laid a wreath to all those who lost their lives. I have previously asked the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if the Deputy would allow the Taoiseach to answer as the Chair has facilitated Deputies in continuing for five minutes longer than we should have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am nearly finished. Are there any plans to compile a definitive list of those who died between that time and the War of Independence? No definitive list exists of those who lost <Col N="16"/>their lives and to whom the wreath laying by the President was dedicated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not know what will ultimately happen with the GPO. There is quite a lot of space and with modern technology, I do not believe the GPO will need all that space in the future. It is worth considering how it is best dealt with and whether it is just 1916 or whether it is a broader look back on Irish life. The best thing is that people give their views on these things and see what is best to do. While it does not need to be decided in the short term, we should not allow it to go on for too long.</P>
        <P>I do not know about the records on &Eacute;amon de Valera. There are a substantial number of records on the deaths. The Deputy referred to a definitive list of all of them. A fixed number of how many were killed is always given. If they cannot match that to names&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>But not the names.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise the matter with the archival people to see what they can do.</P>
        <P>Historians are very glad that a definitive list of the 1916 volunteers has been compiled, based on the applications for pension arrangements which were received not long afterwards. Such a list has not been available before now. We have given clearance for the list to be digitalised so historians can build a far better picture of the people who were involved in the events of 1916. Perhaps they can also look at the records mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte in the context of the definitive list.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, one of the key recommendations of the Athens review, which was published last year, was that the structures necessary to establish an Irish institute of sport should be put in place to deliver optimal support services for Olympic and Paralympic athletes and sports. It was envisaged that the institute would form the basis of a long-term and sustainable high performance infrastructure, taking into account the experiences of and expertise within the National Coaching and Training Centre, which is based in the University of Limerick. The recent report of the Joint Commit<Col N="17"/>tee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Ireland and the Olympics: From Athens to London, also recommended that such an institute should be established as a priority. At my request, the Irish Sports Council, with the assistance of a technical expert group and an advisory expert group, has developed proposals for the establishment of such an institute. The expert groups comprised international experts in sports science and medicine with experience in the development of the concept of an institute. I have received the Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s proposals. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is involved in discussions with the council with a view to teasing out the issues involved. I intend to bring proposals in this regard to the Government in the near future.</P>
        <P>I am enthusiastic about the potential of the proposed institute of sport to become a source of real support for Ireland&rsquo;s elite athletes. If the institute makes available the best emerging technology, sport science and sport medicine to those athletes, it will bring this country&rsquo;s support system into line with that available to the athletes&rsquo; counterparts elsewhere. The existing providers of specialist supports to elite performers will have a key role in the new structure. Significant progress has been made in the development of a high performance system in Ireland in recent years. Increased levels of funding have been made available, specific programmes of support have been put in place and national and regional training centres have been constructed. The Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s budget has increased by over 210% since its establishment, from &euro;13.2 million in its first full year of operation in 2000 to &euro;40.9 million in 2006. The additional funding being provided to the council this year includes &euro;1 million to meet the costs associated with establishing the proposed institute in 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal in the Athens review that a national institute of sport should be established was supported by the high-performance strategy group in December 2001, the joint committee in its report of 2005 and many other commentators. I am sure the Minister will agree that such an institute is needed if we are to ensure that our elite athletes can compete on a level playing pitch at the Olympic Games and other international events. Well developed institutes of sport are in place in countries such as New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom, which are getting the results at international level. Will the Minister consider seriously the designation of the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick as the national institute of sport? The institute could have a hub in Dublin, at UCD or DCU, and nodes in other parts of the country, including Cork and Galway. The work of the institute should link with that of the institute of sport in Northern Ireland.</P><Col N="18"/>
        <P>The Minister is familiar with the details of the proposal and I understand that money has been earmarked. He needs to appoint the necessary experts in the areas of sports science and sports medicine. Will the Minister give the House a commitment that the new institute of sport will be based in Limerick? Will he provide the resources to enable the necessary expertise to be identified and the appropriate international people to be hired so that the project can be pursued as soon as possible? The institute is needed if our athletes are to prepare properly for Beijing and London.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has correctly stated that the establishment of an institute of sport has been recommended by a number of bodies. There is no point in seeking to establish such an institute unless the funding for it is available and, happily, I have secured the funding for this year. Therefore, the institute of sport will be established. I will have to bring a proposal to the Government very quickly. The country has been waiting for an institute of sport. It is fair to say that our elite athletes are at a disadvantage compared to their counterparts elsewhere because such an institute is not in place. We intend to correct that now. As I said in my initial reply, the existing providers of specialist supports to elite performers will have key roles in the institute. The National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick has provided valuable support to our elite athletes in recent years. The proposed development at Abbotstown and the existing national and regional training centres will be integral parts of the institute. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Irish Sports Council are developing the specific format of the institute in line with the proposals of the report of the advisory group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make the case for the location of the institute in Limerick. The Munster rugby team is successful because it has availed of the top-class facilities offered by the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick. If one wishes to make the case for Limerick strongly, I am sure the Munster team can be seen as a barometer in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 62 together.</P>
        <P>I received the independent report into matters relating to Bord na gCon from Mr. Tim Dalton on 5 April last. As Deputies are aware, on 1 February last I appointed Mr. Dalton, who is a former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to carry out an investigation into issues relating to corporate management in Bord na gCon, as well as the management of positive tests for banned substances. I am considering the contents of the report in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, following which I will consult my Cabinet colleagues before I decide on the further action that will need to be taken, including the arrangements for the publication of the report. I do not intend to make any further comment on the matter until this process has been completed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister confirm that an outside public relations consultant was employed, at a cost of &euro;20,000, to assist with a press conference that was held at Shelbourne Park in early February? Is the matter dealt with in Mr. Dalton&rsquo;s report? Does the Minister approve of expenditure of that nature?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I said that I do not intend to comment at this point on what is or is not contained in Mr. Dalton&rsquo;s report. I also said that I intend to complete my consultations with the Office of the Attorney General on the matter before bringing it to the attention of my Government colleagues. All I will say about the matter raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea is that, as he is aware, I have asked all parties involved in this matter to desist from public comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister asked Mr. Dalton to investigate the issue of the control of doping. According to a number of leaks in various newspapers, it has been proposed that this aspect of Bord na gCon&rsquo;s responsibility should be transferred to an independent agency. The provisions of the Greyhound Industry (Doping Regulation) Bill 2006, which I introduced some time ago, are in line with the proposals I made when I was a Minister of State in 1996. This problem would not arise if I was still in office because suitable legislation would be in place. Given that it seems Mr. Dalton has recommended that responsibility for the control of doping should be taken from Bord na gCon, will the Minister consider accepting my Bill if I introduce it in Private Members&rsquo; time?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="20"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that all the issues dealt with in Mr. Dalton&rsquo;s report, which will be published in due course, will be debated in the House or in a committee of the House. I have said from the outset that everybody involved in this matter will receive due process. The Deputy will understand why I do not intend to depart from that promise at this late juncture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>To the best of my recollection, the press conference about which I asked took place after the Minister appointed Mr. Dalton to investigate this matter. Was Mr. Dalton asked to deal with the issue of the press conference and any costs relating to it? Did he deal with those issues in his report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my intention to have the report published. All the questions Deputy O&rsquo;Shea asked will then, hopefully, be answered. On the press conference, the Deputy will be aware that I stated at the time that people should desist from public comment pending completion of the investigation by Mr. Dalton. That was my position then and is, still. Everybody involved will receive due process. It is necessary that this happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister publish the report as soon as possible because there is major uncertainty within the industry? As the Minister knows, it is very important to protect the credibility of this flourishing industry, to publish the report as soon as possible and to take the necessary action. He will have the support of this side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>My intention is to publish the report when the consultative process has been completed and when it has been brought to Government. I assure Deputy Deenihan it will be published at the earliest date available after that.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport</askee>
        <Quest>and Tourism if he will make a submission to Fingal County Council regarding the lands at Abbotstown and the county council study to determine a suitable mix of sporting and appropriate commercial, leisure and amenity uses in order to create a vibrant and sustainable sports campus; and if he will investigate the possibility of opening up these lands for recreational use for the residents of the greater Blanchardstown area.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15403/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>In November 2005 the Government gave its assent to the commencement of phase one of development of the national sports campus at Abbotstown. The estimated cost of the project is &euro;119 million with a four to five year delivery schedule, 2006-10.</P><Col N="21"/>
        <P>To obtain guidance on the planning issues involved in such a major project, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development, CSID, met Fingal County Council and was advised that the lands in question were specifically mentioned in the county development plan. The precise text in the plan is:</P>
        <P LI="1">To undertake a study to determine a suitable mix of sporting and appropriate commercial, leisure, and amenity uses in order to create a vibrant and sustainable sports campus. This study shall also investigate the possibility of opening up these lands for recreation use for the residents of the greater Blanchardstown area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the course of the discussions with Fingal County Council the idea of approaching the matter by means of an inter-agency study emerged. My Department requested the assistance of the Office of Public Works, as its technical adviser in project development matters, to bring its expertise to bear in the preparation of the study. As a consequence, a group chaired by the Office of Public Works and consisting of representatives of my Department, the Departments of Finance and Agriculture and Food, the OPW, CSID and Fingal Country Council has been established and has now commenced work on the study. CSID has already had ongoing general discussions with Fingal County Council on planning and zoning issues.</P>
        <P>I expect that the study will require a period of months to be completed. In the meantime I do not wish to pre-empt its outcome by further comment. I look forward to receiving its recommendations in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want the Minister to pre-empt the outcome of the study, but I would like him to elaborate on the development of the Abbotstown lands from the viewpoint of having them opened as a residential amenity for residents of the greater Blanchardstown and wider area. Does the Minister agree that greater Blanchardstown is growing at an unprecedented rate, with thousands of residential units being built in a very short space of time? There is enormous pressure for public open space and a great need for recreational facilities. Is he aware of an adjoining massive development, at Tyrellstown, of 2,000 homes, opened for the first time only four years ago, with not an acre of &ldquo;Class 1&rdquo; open space? Incredibly the county council let the developer off with a cash contribution and now land, as a result of the speculators&rsquo; unbridled greed, cannot be bought for an enormous conglomeration such as that. Could this situation not be ameliorated if the lands at Abbotstown were opened as part of a plan for recreational facilities for the community in the greater Blanchardstown <Col N="22"/>area? I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on this and those of his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand how Deputy Joe Higgins might be concerned about this issue, since he is a representative for the area. The need for an inter-agency study arose from the commitment in the Fingal county development plan to undertake such an exercise. The aim is that all the planning and development issues and options should be considered by a group comprising the relevant experts and representatives and I have outlined who they are. The involvement of the Departments of Finance and Agriculture and Food neatly brings together all of the agencies with responsibility for involvement in developing the site. Outside expertise will also be employed, where necessary. It really is best to await the outcome of this study before deciding precisely on how to move forward. Incidentally, in that context it is intended that the study should set out an agreed set of proposals, if possible, which would be put forward for consultation and agreement by Fingal local authority representatives. There is no question of the Minister or the Department superimposing their will on anybody. There will be full consultation after the set of proposals is prepared. That is a reasonable stance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister and his Department will consider the proposal positively. When I was first elected to Dublin County Council, as it was in 1991, there was a proposal for a regional park for greater Blanchardstown, comprising those lands. Unfortunately, the Department of Agriculture and Food blocked that at every hand&rsquo;s turn and the people of Blanchardstown did not get their regional park. There is a great need for both active and passive recreational space in the greater Blanchardstown area, for family groups, individuals and young people. I ask the Minister and his Department when participating in the discussions, to be proactive towards ensuring that those facilities can be made available for the residents of greater Blanchardstown.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that the views of the local people, through their representatives, will be fully taken into account. Neither I nor the Department wish to superimpose our will. We will be proactive in seeking to accommodate where we can possibly do so. I am really pleased that the sports campus will get under way this year. That will please the people in the general locality as well. It is necessary and important that their views are taken into account and implemented where possible.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport</askee>
        <Quest>and Tourism if his attention has been drawn to the recent survey carried out by the insurers of the National Aquatic Centre, that states that the centre has seeping roofs, corroding fixtures and possible water leaks; if he will request that Campus Stadium Ireland Development obtain an independent engineers&rsquo; report on the building; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15138/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a report prepared for CSID, the landlords of the National Aquatic Centre. My Department has been in touch with CSID and has been advised that the facts in the report do not support the conclusions the Deputy has drawn from them. I understand from CSID that it is standard practice for a property survey to be carried out each year by the insurer prior to the renewal of the insurance on the National Aquatic Centre. The issues raised in the report relate to the day-to-day operation of the National Aquatic Centre and consequently are matters for Dublin Waterworld Ltd., the operator of the centre.</P>
        <P>I am also assured that the National Aquatic Centre is fully and properly insured.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the publicity that has accrued since the report of the insurer was leaked, does the Minister not agree there should be an independent inquiry to put all these matters to rest? Some of the issues raised were serious. In view of the fact that the roof blew off the building as well as the allegation concerning the enormous water loss in the operation of the aquatic centre, these matters should be cleared up, once and for all. The public is entitled to know, by way of an independent report, the exact position on the aquatic centre. Different versions of the story are being put into the public domain and the Minister has received assurances as well. Will he agree that it would be in everybody&rsquo;s interest to have the whole situation independently examined and reported on, not least the development and running of the aquatic centre?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Various questions have been asked during the past year and prior to that about the National Aquatic Centre. I have answered questions on this subject on numerous occasions. I attach no blame to Deputy O&rsquo;Shea in that respect. He is entitled to ask any question he wishes. However, I wish to make clear that the National Aquatic Centre is a world class facility which is being enjoyed by tens of thousands of people every year.</P><Col N="24"/>
        <P>The spectre of defects at the centre has been raised on numerous occasions but these allegations which appeared in the media last year about leaks and cracks have all been dealt with. If one takes into account the facts of the report, which was prepared meticulously by experts, it definitively discounted the negative material. For example, a team consisting of Rohcon, the contractor for the centre, and its expert, and CSID and its experts, investigated all these allegations last summer, having had to go to the High Court to gain access to the centre. Public statements of the findings of these experts were made at that time. I will not waste the valuable time of this House by reiterating all those findings. Damage to the roof was incurred due to an unfortunate event that occurred on 1 January 2005. The roof has been fixed and the centre, which was re-opened on 20 May last year, has been operating successfully since then.</P>
        <P>This is a world class centre without any question or doubt. It has hosted the Special Olympics and the European short course championships. It is something about which the nation should be proud instead of one about which people should have doubts. I want once again to dispel those doubts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand a snag list was drawn up before and after the centre was opened and that this process has not yet been completed. With reference to structural defects, I understand that the overview which took place was just that, rather than a detailed structural report. The only detailed structural engineering report that was carried out on the roof was after 20 m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> of it was blown away on New Year&rsquo;s Day in 2005. I support Deputy O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s call for a report. On numerous occasions I called for an international engineering consultancy firm to be employed for this purpose, or even for Kavanagh Mansfield structural engineers, which has already completed a report on a small section of the roof, to carry out a definitive report so that we can ascertain once and for all if there are defects and, if that is the case, that they can be fixed. That would help the integrity of the centre and ensure its future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate if full payment has been withheld from the contractor at this stage, and if all moneys that were due to Campus Stadium Ireland by Dublin Waterworld have been paid following the outcome of the High Court case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my understanding that the case is, or may be, subject to appeal. Therefore, I must be very careful about what I say in regard to it. To the best of my knowledge, to date, funds have not been received in respect of VAT from Dublin Waterworld. With regard to the report to which the Deputies refer, there have <Col N="25"/>been many reports on this centre and I assume that Deputy Burton&rsquo;s question relates to a property survey report which was carried out by AIG for CSID dated 20 February 2006. That report was copied to Dublin Waterworld Limited.</P>
        <P>With regard to the alleged defects specified in this question, there is no reference in the report to seeping roofs and the reference to corrosion is made in regard to elements of the centre that are the responsibility of Dublin Waterworld and are, therefore, part of the maintenance contract and, accordingly, are the responsibility of the operators, namely, Dublin Waterworld Limited. The insurance on the National Aquatic Centre is up to date. The premium falls due in March each year and CSID is obliged under the lease to ask its insurance broker to seek tenders for the renewal.</P>

        <Quest>and Tourism his views on the most recent statistics released by the Central Statistics Office regarding the number of tourists visiting here; his further views on the fact that visitor numbers to Ireland from the United States and Canada fell during the final quarter of 2005 in comparison with the previous year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15136/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 92 together.</P>
        <P>The recent publication by the Central Statistics Office of data for tourism and travel in 2005 presented a healthy overall picture for tourism in Ireland. This was evident in both an increased number of overseas visitors, up 6% to almost 7 million, and a significant rise in revenue, up almost 8% to &euro;3.455 billion, excluding carrier receipts. On both counts, we exceeded targets set for 2005.</P>
        <P>As global competition intensifies and consumer preferences evolve, these results represent a very robust performance by the sector and confirm <Col N="26"/>just how dynamic and responsive is the Irish tourism sector. Looking at performance by market, the most striking feature last year was the position for mainland Europe where visitor numbers to Ireland were up almost 20%, to 1.9 million, with revenue up 32%, to &euro;1.23 billion. This brings mainland Europe almost on a par with Britain in revenue terms and confirms that we are very much on target in regard to the tourism priority in An Agreed Programme for Government which seeks to broaden our source markets, especially in continental Europe.</P>
        <P>From a strategic perspective, mainland Europe represents a very important source market, particularly in terms of regional spread and take up of tourism activities. Increased access from key European markets, especially to the regions, has been a major contributor to this growth and the challenge this year will be to build on this level of success. After a challenging period of intense competition in the British market, Ireland&rsquo;s overall performance in 2005 represents steady progress with growth of 3.8% in overall numbers and revenue showing a marginal increase of 0.3%. There remains a variety of challenges for the industry in Britain, particularly in growing the holiday component of the market. However, it is also true that the burgeoning VFR, visiting friends and relatives, market from Britain has always been and will remain of immense strategic importance to Ireland.</P>
        <P>The CSO figures also bear out earlier forecasts in regard to the US and Canada which have proven more difficult to grow at the exceptional rates seen in previous years. Recognising the importance of the North American market to the Irish tourism industry, Tourism Ireland has already initiated an extensive review of its business activities there. The findings from this review will allow it to adjust its marketing programmes locally to help the sector achieve improved results for this year and beyond. I understand that the review is expected to be completed by September.</P>
        <P>One fact worth noting about the trend in the North American market is that performance had been exceptionally strong in 2004 and the slippage in 2005 has come from a very high base. So, while there was a slight decrease in the number of visitors from the USA and Canada in 2005, the level was still up by over 5% on 2003. I am confident, therefore, that the underlying trend remains positive and that the review by Tourism Ireland will help to ensure that the outlook remains positive.</P>
        <P>The latest data published by the CSO for 2006 cover the month of January. These show a continuation of the positive trend in terms of visitor numbers to Ireland with an 8% increase over the same month last year. While this return is certainly encouraging, the data only cover one off-peak month and it would be unwise to read too much into them. Nevertheless, I see no reason <Col N="27"/>2006 cannot be another successful year for Irish tourism and that we can achieve our targets of a 5% growth in visitor numbers with an associated increase of 6.7% in revenue earnings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the trend is positive in spite of the increasingly competitive global market. I wish to raise some questions about the short and long term in this regard. While the British market has increased overall since 2002 following the previous year&rsquo;s foot and mouth disease crisis, I suggest the decline in relative terms <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>other European destinations, for example, and the resurgent North American market is directly related to walking holidays. In that context, does the Minister support calls by the IFA for some form of payment for guaranteeing access to land, or at least maintaining marked ways, and will he liaise with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in this regard?</P>
        <P>The issue of peak oil, which the Greens have been talking about for years, is eventually getting the media attention it deserves. In five or ten years&rsquo; time it could well be the case that medium and long haul flights, including cheap flights from Europe to Ireland, will be a thing of the past and it will be increasingly difficult to market Ireland as a cheap affordable destination when fuel and oil prices make it very difficult to get here.</P>
        <P>In this context should we not be making as much strategic preparation as possible to target the British market in the long term and to encourage British, French, German and Dutch people to come to Ireland? These countries are near enough to Ireland. The price of flights will inevitably rise and jobs in the tourism industry will be affected unless we have a strategy in place now to deal with something which is not that far away. Has this issue been discussed at Cabinet?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully supportive of the promotion of the country for walking and activity holidays in general. In that context, the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, established Comhairle na Tuaithe which is charged with seeking to resolve difficulties in regard to access to land for hill walkers and therefore comes within the remit of that Minister. I am fully supportive of his efforts in this respect.</P>
        <P>As part of An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government has been making a major effort to promote the country in mainland Europe. On becoming Minister I endeavoured to concentrate much of the resources and efforts in building up the European market and I am very pleased it is working out. An increase of 20% in visitors from mainland Europe last year was quite a stupendous performance when one considers that revenue from mainland European visitors is now almost on a par with that from British visit<Col N="28"/>ors to Ireland. This shows we have made tremendous progress.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a result of a dip in visitors from Britain in the year before last, we immediately brought forward a strategy to adopt an aggressive approach to the British market following the most intensive ever survey of that market. This strategy has yielded results. Statistics for last year show an increase of 3.8% over the previous year which is very significant as the number of visitors coming to Ireland from Britain is extremely high at 4.75 million per annum. In general terms there has been a major effort to try to bring in more people from nearer destinations and I am confident this will be welcomed by everybody. We will continue our efforts in the North American market as it remains extremely important.</P>
        <P>With regard to the increases in the price of fuel, we do not have any great influence over what happens. The tourism agencies are conscious of this factor and are seeking to make Ireland as attractive as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a decrease in the numbers of visitors from the USA and Canada in the last quarter of 2005 compared with the same quarter in the previous year and this is of concern. I agree the escalating cost of fuel is in many ways beyond national control. Aer Lingus is introducing a surcharge on long haul flights beginning on 15 May 2006. Are any devices available to the Government to subsidise the long haul carrier, the national carrier and other carriers operating on the route? It must be a concern that as the price of oil increases, it could have a significant effect on the numbers travelling to Ireland from long haul areas such as the United States and Canada. Is this issue being examined and are any realistic avenues available to allow the Government assist in keeping down the cost of travel?</P>
        <P>I refer to the ferries which bring motorists from Britain to Ireland. It is correct to state that visitor numbers from the UK are increasing but will the Minister agree that to a large extent these visitors are coming to Dublin and staying there? The current pattern is for more short-stay visits. The British motoring tourist has always been very important in areas such as the south-east region and in the Minister&rsquo;s region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>When Irish visitors go to France they can bring back quite a quantity of duty-free wine. Is there any way this can be matched in order to entice tourists into this country? Could concessions on goods be made available on ferries?</P>

	<P>I am sure the Minister will agree that while visitor numbers have increased, the number of overnights has decreased with the average decreasing from 7.9 to seven per visitor. In view of the significant decline in the number of golfers coming from the USA which has been experienced in places such as Ballybunion and Waterville in our county, what initiatives are being taken by the Minister to reverse that trend? Golfers are high-spending tourists. What plans has the Minister to use the publicity and hype surrounding the Ryder Cup to entice American tourists to come back to Ireland to play golf on our courses? Has the Minister undertaken an analysis of the market to determine whether it is a matter of price?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 84 together.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>As I previously advised the House in response to a similar question on 1 March, individual actions and measures relating to tourism promotion or development at regional level are day-to-day functions of the State tourism agencies.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, F&aacute;ilte Ireland commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers just over a year ago to conduct a major study of regional tourism structures. The report was published last year and is available on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website. This work was supplemented by a short engagement, facilitated by a small independent group chaired by Mr. John Travers, with the relevant parties in order to satisfy interests in the Dublin region that the mechanisms of consultation were complete.</P>
        <P>The PWC report highlights the need for a much wider brief for regional tourism, with more emphasis on its strategic rather than administrative role and contributing more directly to national policy. It recommends a greatly increased emphasis on targeted marketing, product development and enterprise support. It suggests establishing an integrated linkage between regional tourism strategy and national policy and exploiting avenues in order to leverage increased resources.</P>
        <P>At the end of July last, I authorised F&aacute;ilte Ireland to proceed with the proposed revision of regional tourism structures on the basis of the PWC and Travers reports. To assist this process, F&aacute;ilte Ireland set up an implementation group under the chairmanship of Mr. Finbarr Flood. The group has completed an extensive process of engagement with the existing regional tourism authorities, industry representative groups and other relevant parties, to smooth the process of implementation. I understand the group recently presented its report to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is now acting on its contents.</P>
        <P>I also understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has begun the process of gearing up its own internal structures to line up with the proposed new structures at regional level. A new senior management position of director of regional development has been created and applications to fill the post have been invited in the national press. A due diligence process with each of the RTAs is almost complete.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland has advised me that it expects the changes will be implemented in the regions by the end of the summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If changes are implemented in the middle of the tourism season, could they be disruptive? Is the Minister aware of the existing uncertainty among the RTAs as to their future role and the fact that they will no longer be managing the tourist information offices? Is he also addressing the problems, for example, in the Cork-Kerry tourism area? There are difficulties in that area, as the Minister will be aware, and that certainly <Col N="31"/>is affecting morale in the area among the workers and the elements of the industry.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Will the Minister answer specifically whether the recommendations will be put in place this summer? Does he envisage any role in future for the RTAs in the local information offices? If the RTAs have no budget, what precisely can they do about product development or whatever? It would seem that in the future the RTAs will really be ineffective. It strikes me that they will be merely talking shops or a forum for the industry, but really ineffective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The opposite is the intention. In fact, the new proposals envisage a wider brief for regional tourism authorities playing a strategic rather than administrative role and providing input into national policy. There will be a greatly increased emphasis by the regional tourism authorities on targeted marketing, product development and inter-price support, and this is precisely what has been recommended in the PWC report.</P>
        <P>I expect the implementation to be completed by the end of the summer. As a consequence of the changes, I expect that the regional tourism authorities will have a far greater role to play on a local level and on a broader more strategic level than was previously the case. As I stated, the report highlighted that the regional tourism authorities were handicapped by virtue of the fact that they did not have as much power as they should have had in targeted marketing, product development and enterprise support, and it is intended through these changes to change all that.</P>
        <P>It is not the intention to take power from the regions and vest it in the centre. The object of the exercise is quite the opposite &mdash; to devolve powers to the regions. Funding will follow the powers. That is the clear intention. I am confident the regional tourism authorities, with their increased powers, will be in a position to grow tourism in the regions to a greater extent than was ever the case previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Referring to powers, this is a typical example of centralisation rather than decentralisation. Recently the Minister promoted the idea of three super regions for marketing and he spent the last tranche of funds through the super regions. How compatible are those three super regions with the existing RTAs? Surely there is a contradiction. Will he persist with his three super regions in the future for marketing, for example, and how will that fit in then with the roles of the seven RTAs in the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The super regions initiative, which was launched by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in February, is the latest and, incidentally, possibly the most significant innovation <Col N="32"/>from an overseas marketing perspective in presenting a better, more tangible concept of Ireland&rsquo;s regions to potential consumers abroad. The initiative, which is additional to Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s destination marketing campaigns and F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s regional allocations and activities, is based on new strategic marketing alliances between adjoining tourism regions, positioning them to exploit international market opportunities more fully so that for marketing purposes, the initiative combines existing RTA regions in the three super regions &mdash; Ireland South, Ireland West and Ireland East. The idea is to present Ireland&rsquo;s regions more coherently to overseas consumers. It is not about creating any new structures at a regional level and will not impact on the restructuring of the regional tourism authorities.</P>
        <P>We found that there was a substantial increase in the number of visitors coming into the major urban centres, for example. For instance, in 2005 the visitor numbers in Dublin increased by 11% and the outer regions did not do as well, with the numbers in some increasing marginally, in some increasing by a little more, in some remaining stagnant and in even one or two showing a slight decline.</P>
        <P>We now seek to market the super regions by emphasising not just the urban attractions but also the rural attractions contiguous to them. By moving in this direction, we will benefit the rural regions as well as seeing continued growth in the urban areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke of the super regions. What is the point of marketing a super region such as the west if it is not possible to access that super region? I refer in particular to the fact that we have an airport, Ireland West Airport, at Knock which is underdeveloped owing to a lack of funding. Although the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, is not Minister for Transport, he has a collective Cabinet responsibility. How can he promote the area when there is no proper access, in other words, when 29 million people visit the east coast and the south whereas only 500,000 people visit the west coast and six million people visit the north of Ireland? That reveals a regional imbalance. There is the national spatial strategy. There is a national development plan which shows a gross underspend on transport, in particular, and on infrastructure right across the board. How can the Minister rationalise a situation where he is flogging a dead horse by trying to promote a region to which there is no proper access?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody will be well aware by now of Transport 21 which contains exciting initiatives intended to improve access throughout the country, not least in the case of <Col N="33"/>the western corridor. It is a measure that Deputy Cowley, in particular, would welcome.</P>
        <P>Access needs to be improved and that is why the plans are in place. Never in the history of the State has more funding been invested in infrastructure. Never in the history of the State has more funding been invested in access. Those plans will be put in place over the next few years and we will see substantial progress.</P>
        <P>While all that takes place, our immediate objective is to improve the number of visitors to the regions and that is why we have made a substantial investment through our marketing programme in helping the regions, by twinning them and by ensuring that we market the super regions to best effect. All these efforts are meant to ensure that there is a greater degree of regionalism and that the spread of tourists is more proportionate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 87, 88 and 91 together.</P>
        <P>As the House will be aware, in January 2004 the Government agreed to provide funding of &euro;191 million to the joint IRFU-FAI project for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium. In January 2006 the planning application for the project was submitted by the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company, LRSDC, the company charged with delivery of the project.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that it is normal practice within any planning process, but certainly for a major project, that the planning authorities would come back to the planning applicant with questions that have been raised in the course of the process by those who have lodged comments or objections or relating to matters that the authorities themselves wish to explore. This form of dialogue is a means by which the most satisfactory solutions can be devised for any issues that arise. Thus, the questions put by the Dublin City Council to Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company are a predictable part of the planning process and do not signal any particular difficulty for the project. LRSDC is preparing a fully comprehensive response to the Dublin City Council&rsquo;s request for further information. Officials from my Department have been briefed by LRSDC in the context of the project steering group and I have been assured that every effort is being made to address all the issues raised to the fullest extent, including those raised by the local residents.</P>
        <P>A number of local residents&rsquo; groups and individual residents have lodged objections to the project. Through the steering group that oversees the development of the project, I am aware the project developers have made very strenuous efforts to meet the concerns of residents in the design that has been chosen for the stadium. By maintaining good channels of communications and by carrying out the requisite studies and investigations, LRSDC is making every effort to ensure the concerns of residents are met in developing the stadium at Lansdowne Road.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to estimate the time that will be required to complete the planning process. Up <Col N="35"/>to the present, the project has proceeded on schedule and I am hopeful the planning process will not set back that schedule. I am confident that by the end of 2009 the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium, which will cater for the international rugby and soccer requirements of the IRFU and the FAI, will be completed.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>Regarding the dispute between the IRFU and Wanderers Rugby Football Club, this is a matter between the IRFU and the two clubs in question and I do not intend to intervene in this matter. It is clear that, ultimately, the issues must be resolved by the parties directly involved. Discussions between these parties are still ongoing and I am confident a solution will be found and the dispute will not delay the redevelopment of the stadium.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s comments on the planning process are absolutely correct but a number of the objections are strong, including, for instance, those relating to the height of the stadium. Its height is proposed to be 38.5 metres compared with Croke Park, which is 35 metres high. Are there concerns that a number of the issues will not be resolved through the dialogue he mentioned? Is it possible the local authority may have difficulty proceeding with planning permission? If issues cannot be resolved through dialogue but planning permission is granted, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have to become involved. The House does not have a role in what the GAA may decide in future about the use of Croke Park but the current arrangement will cease at the end of 2009. How serious are the objections? Has the Minister received indications that issues will be difficult to resolve?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the estimate for the completion of the stadium is dependent on the project commencing in 2007, will the Government be prepared to review its financial commitment to the stadium in the event of a protracted planning process? If the project is delayed for 12 months, what increase in costs is envisaged?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, it is difficult to know what the planning authority will say about the objections that have been raised. On 12 January 2006 the planning application for the proposed new stadium was lodged with Dublin City Council by the development company and the closing date for the lodgment of objections was Wednesday, 15 February 2006. A total of 151 submissions were received, of which 20 were from rugby and soccer clubs that generally supported the project, while the remaining 130 were objections or semi-neutral observations with a large <Col N="36"/>concentration made by residents or residents&rsquo; associations. The objections were along predictable lines and issues included the stadium size, sun and daylight, crowd behaviour and so on. The development company is preparing material in response to the city council&rsquo;s request for further information.</P>
        <P>If the stadium does not proceed, the probability is that the Lansdowne Road site would be developed for commercial purposes and office blocks, shopping centres, houses and apartments and so on built. A magnificent stadium, which has been praised by a number of the State&rsquo;s leading environmentalists, would not be more intrusive than a concrete jungle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning the people of Dublin woke up to yet another murder, the 19th this year. Familiarity breeds contempt. Today, executions, hits and gun crime are rife across the capital city. It is only a few weeks since coked up psychopaths in flak jackets and top of the range cars went head to head with machine guns on the M50, which was turned into the Irish equivalent of the Los Angeles freeway. On that occasion luck, rather than the law, prevented somebody completely innocent from being murdered in the crossfire. Crime figures are not just statistics. They are the evidence of murder and terror spreading across the city and they are the reality behind the 71% increase in murder, the 22% increase in robbery and the 25% increase in theft from vehicles. This is what is behind the necessity to feed the coke habit costing &euro;1,000 a day, which is rampant in the city and which is about to be further enhanced with the arrival of methylamphetamine from the US.</P>
      <P>Only 12 of the 75 murders committed with weapons between 1998 and 2004 ended in conviction. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government promised to make people safe on the streets and in their homes following five years of zero tolerance introduced by the current Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. Nine years after a change in the bail laws, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is reviewing it so that those who are out on bail cannot commit further serious crime. Does the Taoiseach accept, despite all the hyperbole and spin, that detection rates have fallen while crime rates are increasing? Does he not see the relevance of constant complaints by the Garda about the lack of facilities for its members to do their job and keep the citizens safe both in their homes and on the streets? Given the statistics I outlined and the failure over nine years to deal with the constantly increasing threat to society, what will the Taoiseach do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>Nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;putting more garda&iacute; on the street, giving the Garda more resources, providing more prison places for offenders and providing more resources for individual initiatives such as Operation Anvil to target criminal gangs directly. Deputy Kenny is correct that murders for the first quarter increased from nine to 12, which is 12 too many. There are more decreases than increases if one goes through the figures in each category of crime.</P>
      <P>The issue is not just about statistics. We must try to do all we can to resource the Garda through its numbers, the laws it enforces and the actions it needs to take to curb crime. The Garda <Col N="38"/>is doing a very good job in many areas, but in a limited number of areas it is up against some very vicious criminals and thugs. Until April this year, 377 firearms were seized under Operation Anvil and more than 2,100 arrests were made for serious crimes, including murder and serious assault. This shows the level of firearms in society. Most of those guns have been found in and around two cities. There have been decreases in many categories of robbery, such as robberies of cash goods in transit, which are down 40%, while robberies from establishments are down 7%. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the Garda Commissioner that he will provide a further &euro;10 million this year towards special Garda operations and tackling specific forms of crime, including burglaries and other offences that have risen in number.</P>
      <P>There are 1,740 more garda&iacute; than there were when this Government took office. The accelerated recruitment, which is well under way, will bring the number in the force up to 14,000. Under this programme, 275 garda&iacute; came on stream last month and an additional 275 will come on stream every 90 days from now on. The Garda has been given resources in every area in which it demanded them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has it taken nine years to begin to realise that the bail laws need to be reviewed, given that serious crimes, including murders, have been committed by persons out on bail? Does the Taoiseach realise the social impact of 100,000 headline crimes committed every year during the tenure of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? If the Government lasts its full term, it will have presided over almost half a million headline crimes. The Taoiseach stated that there are more garda&iacute; on the streets and that resources are being provided, but in reply to parliamentary questions a couple of weeks ago, the Minister admitted that the green man system is obsolete and that it will not be replaced for several years, according to priority established by him. Garda&iacute; with inferior <Col N="39"/>communications are up against vicious, criminal organisations in a number of locations. Garda&iacute; in this and other cities have told me that they are calling their stations on their own mobile phones. In some places, garda&iacute; have to travel to the scene of crimes and accidents in hired taxis while others are driving around in vehicles that have been involved in several crashes and are not roadworthy, as was shown in a tragic case where one of these vehicles crashed.</P>
      <P>Former Deputy Charlie Flanagan &mdash; soon to be a Deputy again &mdash; pointed out that in Portlaoise Garda station, which houses 120&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Of 120 members in Portlaoise Garda station, a town in which the highest maximum security prison in the State is located, there is only one bullet-proof vest available. Is this not an indictment of a Government that has spun the most sophisticated web of high rhetoric, hyperbole and nonsense? The central remit of the Government in terms of crime is that the people would be safe on the streets and in their homes, but neither has happened and that is an indictment of the whole Government, particularly of he who speaks most about what should be done but fails to do it.</P>

	<P>Headline crime increased by 8% in the first quarter of 2006 compared with the same quarter of 2005, and I am not dodging that fact. There was an increase of about 7% across a number of categories, but it is a mixed picture. A total of 25 headline offences have been listed by the Garda, in 13 of which decreases were recorded and in 12 increases were recorded.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McCormack asked about the population issue. I do not like giving comparisons based on population figures because they can be meaningless, but the level of headline crime <i>per capita </i>is significantly lower than it was a decade ago. In 1995, with a population of 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per thousand of the population. The most recent figures show that with a population of 4.1 million, there were 25 crimes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>

	<P>I ask the Deputy to remain silent and allow the Taoiseach to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When I reply to Deputies&rsquo; questions the figures do not suit them. The figure was reduced to 25 crimes per thousand of the population. There is a significant decrease in crime, based on the facts. As long as any crime <Col N="41"/>infringes on people&rsquo;s rights, all we can do in a democracy is to resource the Garda, increase its numbers and assist in whatever way we can to fight criminals in the limited areas of significant crime. Senior garda&iacute; have made it clear they experience persistent difficulties in a limited number of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>People shooting each other on the motorway &mdash; that is limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the facts outlined by the Taoiseach, one would expect him to have the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attend to these issues rather than reheat old tax plans or create diversions.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a different aspect of the criminal justice system with the Taoiseach. It is a sensitive matter and I regret any invasions of privacy caused by discussing the health of a retired distinguished public servant, Dr. John Harbison. However, fundamental questions arise with regard to public policy and the integrity of the expert forensic services supplied by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the criminal justice system. The outcome of the Annabel&rsquo;s case was deeply distressing for all concerned and I know people on every side of the House feel the pain of the parents of Brian Murphy. I ask the Taoiseach whether any other explanation exists for the stark difference of opinion between two professionals, other than that Dr. Harbison is ill.</P>
      <P>It is important to note this is not the responsibility of the DPP. In recent days, the Minister has stated on a number of occasions that the office of the DPP is separate and we know that. The fact is that the State pathology service is appointed, funded and administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, therefore, it and the Minister are responsible for the service. Over the weekend, it was leaked that the former State pathologist is ill and will not be able to give evidence in future cases. Questions now arise about his past capacity to perform post mortems and his ability to give evidence in future. When did the Minister know about the health problems of the former State pathologist? Did he know this unavailability would impact on future cases or that the past as well as future competence of the former State pathologist might be at issue? When did the Minister put all the information he had into the possession of the DPP?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach arrange for the Minister to make a full statement before the House? Last night, the Minister sought to announce that he would reform the law to preserve the taking of depositions so statements could be put in evidence in the future. However, when challenged on a television programme last night, he immediately backtracked and admitted that it was nonsense that someone could submit such evidence <Col N="42"/>without being subject to cross-examination. We need to hear from the Minister and, in the interim, the Taoiseach needs to reassure us as to whether it is expected that convictions will be open to challenge as a result of the information which has come to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the facts to answer the detailed questions asked about the timing and the Minister&rsquo;s knowledge. I hope Deputy Rabbitte is not asking me to supply this information and, while I will bring his questions to the attention of the Minister, the best way to obtain a full statement would be to put down a question to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Ministers have no role in the investigation or prosecution of cases. The role of the Garda is to investigate alleged offences and to gather whatever evidence they can and that goes to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The question of whether an individual should be prosecuted for a criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP. The Minister said he will hold talks with the DPP to see whether ways exist through which evidence for use in trials can be preserved in advance. Obviously, that is what he intends to do.</P>
      <P>On the issue of resources for the State pathology service, the Department is in regular dialogue with the State pathologist regarding resource needs. The Department has dealt with those needs by making additional resources available over a long period of time.</P>
      <P>I do not have information on what cases could be affected by Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s illness nor do I know whether that information is available within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not expect details from the Taoiseach but it is immensely disquieting that he is unable to offer any reassurances on a matter of such major importance to the criminal prosecution system. The Taoiseach manifestly dodged the questions and he should not try to pretend to the House that he would not be given a detailed note from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with a question as serious as this, which anybody could have anticipated. Given the Taoiseach comes here with detailed briefs on matters far less important than this, I am very disturbed. There is no point in the Taoiseach rambling on about Ministers having no role in investigations or prosecutions. We all know the rules about the separation of offices. The issue arising from the unfortunate Annabel&rsquo;s case pertains not only to that case but also to the capacity of the then State pathologist to conduct post mortems around and about that time and to give evidence in those trials. I cannot accept this is not regarded as a matter of the gravest urgency by the Government, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or that the Taoiseach would not <Col N="43"/>have been briefed. Can we expect more cases in which convictions are opened to challenge as a result of what has happened?</P>
      <P>I have a statement which was attributed to Dr. Harbison upon his retirement or, at least, consequent to the announcement made by the Department of his retirement after almost 30 years of faithful service. He was a distinguished public servant and gave great service to the State. In March 2003, the public press attributed to him the following statement: &ldquo;The Government decided from January 1st I was not to examine any more new bodies but I am still working and I am still the State pathologist&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The facts now give rise to profound questions about the integrity of our criminal prosecution system and the duty of the Government to maintain that integrity. I want to know when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform knew about the infirmity I referred to and when he put the DPP in possession of all that he knew. Does he have any idea how many post mortems or trials may have to be reviewed as a result of this case? Was he told at the time that the past as well as future competence of the former State pathologist may be opened to question? These are profound questions and I expected the Taoiseach to have a detailed note to reassure public opinion on an issue as grave as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte asked a number of questions, among the main two being when the Government became aware of Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s illness, but I do not know when that came to light. I do not know whether the cases he had dealt with were considered to be perfect when he retired. The State always had one State pathologist and this Government appointed a second State pathologist, who was involved in most cases over the years. The second question the Deputy asked, which is not within my domain or that of the Minister, is whether other cases could be challenged or might have insufficient evidence for the DPP to take a case due to Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s illness. I do not know the answer to that and it is not a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is a matter for the DPP. Whether the DPP proceeds with a case or a case is challenged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does he not answer it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He asked if cases could be challenged or could fall based on the judgment of Dr. Harbison who was in ill health. He put the question clearly on two occasions. I cannot be briefed on that question, nor can it be known by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The only person who can answer that question, if it is possible to answer it as one cannot predict whether cases will be challenged, is the DPP. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no role in investigating an alleged offence except to gather information on events and to submit a report to the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>He is responsible for the provision of expert forensic evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He has no other role. I ask the Deputy not to try to confuse what is clear in law. The Minister has no role whatsoever to influence that. If somebody challenges or appeals a case, or if the DPP decides not to proceed with a case, that is a matter entirely for the DPP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>At the Irish Medical Organisation conference last weekend doctors committed to the public health service, as opposed to those who see health as a source of speculation or profit, raised strong questions on Government policy in facilitating private hospitals with generous tax breaks and other concessions. How does the Taoiseach answer the assertion from those who are deeply committed to public health care, backed by international and other sources, that they do not support the creeping privatisation of Irish health care that the Government is facilitating, either as the most effective use of resources or the best health care for patients?</P>
      <P>The pernicious greed espoused by the Progressive Democrats as a recipe for Irish society, with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s blessing, involves a relentless, creeping privatisation in the health service. Witness the so-called Comfort Keepers franchise being brought in from America for old people. We used to think Colonel Sanders was responsible only for Kentucky Fried Chicken, but our <Col N="45"/>old people are now to be put at the mercy of those people.</P>
      <P>The Government is giving hundreds of millions of euro in tax breaks to profit-seeking speculators to build for-profit hospitals. How does the Taoiseach reconcile the fact that while the Health Service Executive says no more public hospital beds are needed, the Government is facilitating the creation of hundreds, if not thousands, of private beds? Is there not a contradiction there? Independent Deputies have frequently told me of their desperation in finding public beds for very ill constituents, and this brings home to us strongly that the thousands of beds cut by the Government&rsquo;s predecessors in the 1980s particularly need to be restored, especially in light of a greatly increasing population.</P>
      <P>How does the Taoiseach answer those assertions and how does he justify those valuable tax breaks for private profit seekers to cherry-pick areas of the health service in which they want to invest with no plan or overall consideration for people, particularly those who are vulnerable and not wealthy, and the needs of the population generally? Does the Government not need to put in the necessary resources to provide the beds, long-stay care and step-down facilities, rather than facilitate private speculators in health care?</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s announcement last year that she would support the building of private hospitals on the grounds of acute public hospitals where they are not already there &mdash; many public hospitals already have a private hospital on the grounds &mdash; was to ensure that beds taken up on a private basis by consultants who have contracts that allow them to do private work are moved into the new private hospitals and replaced by beds in the public hospitals.</P>
      <P>The second issue is the debate on how many more public and private beds we need. There are many different views on that. The Government&rsquo;s view is that we require more private beds. We have produced approximately 900 over the past few years and there are plans for many more in hospitals around the country. Based on the number of people who have private health insurance, there is a demand for day and private beds in those locations.</P>

	<P>Did it ever strike the Taoiseach that it is those who are genuinely committed to public health care and the health service who oppose the privatisation policy of his Government whereas those who favour it are the speculators, including certain sections of the medical profession who seek to gain by investing &mdash; in other words, speculating &mdash; in health care?

The T&aacute;naiste in her reform proposal would like to make provision whereby we could have public consultants. As the Deputy knows, that is not the position for the entire consultant staff, given that others work on a 9:11 sessional basis and are not interested in becoming public consultants only. We must make provision for those staff. The Deputy will agree that where at present in acute public hospitals a number of the designated beds in what are public wards is designated private&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 on a matter of national and local importance. The Department of Education and Science funded the construction of a 16-teacher school in Naas, County Kildare, Scoil Br&iacute;de, but despite the fact there are extremely high pupil-teacher ratios in other primary schools in Naas, that pupils are forced to use gym rooms as classrooms, and that children requiring remedial resources must travel by taxi from Naas to Tallaght, the fully equipped Scoil Br&iacute;de, which opened last September, will enrol only two junior infant classes per year.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>The only reason for that appalling situation is that the other schools in Naas will not agree a common enrolment policy that would allow the school to be opened fully. Is the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, in charge of our schools, or are they entirely autonomous? I call on her to intervene in this matter immediately to ensure the children of Naas have the best possible start in life and are able to attend a fully staffed school, with lower pupil-teacher ratios and appropriate resources for all. Enrolment policies must not be bargaining tools for school authorities, which should instead focus solely on the child&rsquo;s best interests. I have a petition signed by 4,500 people from Naas to deliver to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

	<P>I note that the Government Whip has produced a list of 16 Bills to be published by the end of the summer session. The document for the spring session contained 17 Bills, eight of which were not published. There are eight new Bills in section A. Will the Government publish those 16 Bills in the next session of ten or 12 weeks? On the last three or four occasions, the Government failed to publish even 50% of the Bills proposed.</P>
      <P>An independent and objective report published yesterday by the ESRI recommended there be no Government splurge before the next election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the very question I wished to ask. In view of the fact the ESRI has made that recommendation to the Government, might we have a debate on the report in the House? Perhaps the Taoiseach might confirm that the Government will adhere to the recommendations of the ESRI report and that there will be no splurge.</P>
      <P>When is it proposed to publish the Bill regarding administrative fines for minor fishing indiscretions that the Taoiseach recommended to the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party some weeks ago? When is it proposed to publish the Bill for single <Col N="54"/>payments of education grants? Some time ago the Minister for Education and Science rightly pointed out that, if we are to have it in force by September, within a few days of which she said payments would be made, it should surely be published and passed before the end of the summer session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the legislation list for the last session there were 16 Bills, ten of which have been published. The other six are at an advanced stage. I make the point at the start of every session that the list runs to the start of the next session, in this case to the autumn. It is intended to pass them all.</P>

	<P>Eight of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are at an advanced stage of preparation and, strictly speaking, should all be published this session. The intention is to get them all published. We rarely get them all out, but we get as near as we can. The fines Bill will provide for updating the indexation of fines and related matters and will be taken this session. I understand the education grants legislation will be taken later this year.

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>So the Order of Business does not become a charade, will certain promised legislation actually appear? As Deputy Kenny said, eight of the 17 Bills promised for the previous session failed to appear. Half those Bills were published. Some 62 Bills have been promised for 2007. Will even a fraction of those 62 Bills appear? Will we have a shorter recess and sit through July? Perhaps the Taoiseach could let us know before people start to plan holidays.</P>
      <P>Are we to believe the 15 Bills on which it was not possible to give any indications will not appear? One of those promised Bills is the register of persons who are considered unsafe to work with children Bill. No date has been given for that legislation but it has been switched from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Health and Children. At what stage is that Bill? Is there any meaning behind that switch given that no date has been specified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was that legislation moved from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Health and Children? Are there indications in terms of the timeframe? The Bill is to protect children and is a North-South initiative. It has been on the legislative programme for the past few years but there has been no indication of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill has been switched to the Office of the Minister for Children where it can be co-ordinated properly across agencies and Departments. That is why it was switched. It makes more sense and is more appropriate that it be dealt with by that Minister and that it be co-ordinated across the agencies for which he is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that speed it up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It should. On Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s other question, 16 Bills are listed for this session. Some 24 other Bills were before the Oireachtas. This Oireachtas has a good record. The programme goes up to the summer recess. This Government has enacted 147 Bills. An enormous legislative programme is before the House but we cannot take all the Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The broadcasting authority Bill was No. 32 in section C of last session&rsquo;s list &mdash; Bills in respect of which heads have yet to be approved by the Government. It has by chance the same number on the new list. However, the problem is the status of the Bill has not changed. The Taoiseach will remember he promised me he <Col N="56"/>would look after it as best he could and bring it forward as quickly as possible. It is only eight or nine weeks until the summer recess and that will be the end of the Bill for this year if we do not pass it before the summer. We will facilitate its passage in whatever way we can if it is brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember what I said to Deputy Stagg. I understood there was a commitment to bring the heads of the Bill before one of the committees but I will follow up on that. I will ask that it is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of questions on proposed legislation. I hope the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty Bill is published this session. Publication of that Bill was promised when I first came into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to confine himself to the legislation. There is no need for a preamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need because it was promised in 2003. It has now been promised for this session, so I hope the Taoiseach will comply with that. The heads of the national monuments Bill were agreed in 2003 but it appears to be listed as a Bill in respect of which heads have not been approved. Its publication date is now 2007. The Curragh of Kildare Bill was promised for 2003 and is now promised for 2006. The crimes Bill was listed in the legislative programme for 2003, although it was not possible to indicate then when it would be taken. It is still not possible to indicate when it will be taken. Why does it appear at all? Will there be any movement on it? The family law Bill was promised for 2004 and then 2006 but it is now promised for 2007. Is there any possibility of publishing that Bill by 2007?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty Bill is listed for this session. The heads of the national monuments Bill were approved some time ago but revisions and a new round of consultations were required in light of the reorganisation and enactment of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill 2004 and the reorganisation of the heritage responsibilities. In regard to the other Bills, including the Curragh of Kildare Bill and the crimes Bill, it is a question of priority. Approximately 15 Bills are brought forward in a session and it depends on the priority in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the work in the Departments. It is still a large number totalling approximately 50 Bills per year. It means some Bills will be brought forward on the basis of priority while others will fall back.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, line 21, to delete &ldquo;14&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;18&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We are back to the same discussion we had on Second Stage and Committee Stage. All these amendments propose that the period of time stipulated be extended from 14 to 18 weeks. The period of 14 weeks is too short, although it is an improvement. Many groups might look for much more, perhaps even 26 weeks, and many other countries would do likewise. We are quite happy to propose an 18-week period for now and attempt to increase it as we go along. I accept what the Minister has stated with regard to partnership talks and the different groups involved, and that he cannot make a decision. I am unhappy that this House cannot make a decision to extend the period if we think it is correct. The Minister of State appears to agree with us that it is right.</P>
      <P>Other than going back over the same debate, will the Minister of State say who will be pushing the case at the partnership talks? Will he make sure that our feelings are very clear on this and that we want the period to be increased? Will he give us the commitment that the matter will be <Col N="59"/>high on the talks agenda? As I stated previously, children are not represented at those talks, and this Bill is about children.</P>
      <P>Every one of us recognises the benefits of having parents with their children for as long as possible. In today&rsquo;s society, with the pressures of business and life, with groups involved in travelling and commuting, parents get little time with their children. I accept there is an onus on us to do all we can without penalising employers too much, but we must make it easier for parents to spend time with their children, especially at vital times. Parental leave is about letting parents pick vital times during the development of their children to spend time with them and be there as parents. Many reports prove that this is beneficial and we can take a step forward in increasing the stipulated leave from 14 to 18 weeks.</P>
      <P>There is no point in going back over the entire debate, but it is a pity that the first two amendments were ruled out of order. On Committee Stage our amendments relating to paid leave were ruled out of order as well. This leaves people who cannot afford to take time off work at a major disadvantage. It is generally people on low wages, whose children could perhaps benefit most, who will miss out. Only those who can afford to take this parental leave will get it, and that is a shame and a pity. It is a shame that we have not at this stage tried to bring in paid leave. I realise the matter will be discussed again, but we in the House are supposed to set legislation by example.</P>
      <P>If the Minister of State gives us a commitment that this issue will be pushed at the talks, I will probably accept it because the process has gone on for so long and we have debated the matter so much. Most other European countries and America have more benefits for parents, and these countries appear to have realised the benefit of having parents at home with children as often as possible. These people should be encouraged, they should be given the time they need and they should be helped, particularly with regard to the amount of money paid and the number of weeks for leave.</P>
      <P>We are doing the bare minimum but we are behind other countries on this matter. That leaves our children at a disadvantage in the years to come when compared to other children in Europe. Our children will have to compete for many things, and it is a shame we cannot give children in this country similar opportunities with regard to parental leave. I emphasise that this Bill is about giving children a chance and helping them out. It is not necessarily about a parent&rsquo;s time off, but what is good for a child. We are hit and miss on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to say to the Minister of State and those involved in this legislation that it is not <Col N="60"/>the Labour Party&rsquo;s intention to delay this Bill in any way. It is too vital for that and too many people are waiting on it. That is the reason we have continuously asked questions about ensuring that it is delivered on time. We are talking about an issue that is controlled by time. Pregnancy lasts for nine months, all going well, and a child continues to grow. The matter is time controlled and we are anxious to have this legislation brought in as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Everybody in the House, be they mothers, fathers or others involved in a child&rsquo;s life, is very conscious that the first few months and first year of life in particular is a very precious time. It passes far too quickly for most of us. Women and parents at work do not get to spend as much time with their children as they would like. I will not get into the economics of the matter, but the time set out in this legislation is a very short period. We are proposing that it be extended to what is still a relatively short period, but it is more time than is currently envisaged in the legislation. The issue is well worth considering.</P>
      <P>The Minister may have researched other countries in the past few months, particularly countries which experienced a drop in population in the past 20 years. These countries have introduced parental leave of an extended nature. In some countries the leave is four years long, a two-year period is common and a three-year period is not that rare. We are still at the point of talking about a 14-week period. We must begin to be adventurous and consider the general well-being of children and their parents.</P>
      <P>I will not hold up this legislation because it is awaited. Women who are pregnant and others who have already delivered their babies are very anxious that it is enacted. The Minister of State may have arguments regarding partnership talks and that this was what was sought, but this was sought five years ago and it is now being done. That does not fill me with great hope in looking for an extension and believing that such an extension will be delivered by the current talks. Will that mean that we will go from a 14-week period to 18 weeks or 24 weeks in ten years?</P>
      <P>It can be tiresome and boring listening to people making the same argument, but it is nonetheless valid. The amendment is in my name as well, and it is worth considering. As one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, we should not be talking of a move from 14-week parental leave to 18 weeks or 24 weeks in ten years. That is only as a result of collective bargaining and we should not proceed in that way. As not enough women are elected, this is not an issue. However women are becoming more conscious of the issue and regardless of who is in Government in future, they will need to look at the issue seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>As both <Col N="61"/>Deputies have said, the proposed amendment seeks to increase the duration of parental leave by a further four weeks to 18 weeks. In its review of the Parental Leave Act 1998, the review group considered proposals made by ICTU and the Equality Authority to increase the duration of parental leave. The proposals were considered bearing in mind the recent extension of maternity and adoptive leave, the Carers&rsquo; Leave Act 2001, the comparative situation in EU member states and the implications for possible future paid parental leave. All these factors were addressed in detail in the review group&rsquo;s 2002 report, which has been published and is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it would be appropriate for the Government or Oireachtas to decide unilaterally to increase significantly the duration of parental leave in the manner suggested by the Deputies. However, I am prepared to make their views known to the parties to the partnership talks process as requested by Deputy English. However, I cannot accept those amendments at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the Minister of State is prepared to make our views clear. I ask the Government to back our views also. Having listened to the Minister of State, I believe he agrees with us. I can understand why he does not want to accept our amendments. However, I would expect the Government at least to make this proposal in the partnership talks. These talks may reach agreement to extend parental leave. In the previous partnership talks, agreement could not be reached, which would lead me to believe that it was very close and they could have been extended. If it is agreed, can we have a guarantee that it will not take four years for the proposals to reach the House? The proposals agreed at the previous talks are now effectively out of date. Much has happened in the past four years and we have moved on with much more pressure on people. Given the developments in recent years I believe there would be greater support for extending the number of weeks of parental leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I still do not understand why the Legislature cannot do something of its own accord without referring to the group conducting centralised bargaining and perhaps the Minister of State could explain it. The Opposition Deputies will need to write to those negotiating on behalf of workers in these talks and insist that a timeframe is laid down in respect of advances on parental leave. When the matter was discussed five years ago I do not believe they ever envisaged it would take so long to introduce. If they now seek increased parental leave, they will not expect it to take another five years.</P>
      <P>While I do not mean to be rude or disrespectful, any guarantee by any Minister at this stage would be a puff of smoke. We have no guarantee <Col N="62"/>that any Minister would still hold the same brief in a few months. There is no guarantee that the same Government will be in place or that the same emphasis will be placed on this issue. If the Government is convinced that the only way to do business is through centralised bargaining and will do nothing outside that process, then the only way to ensure that this change is made quickly rather than as slowly as it has been up to now may be to have it written into the partnership agreement as opposed to waiting and leaving it open-ended to be introduced by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the Deputy. Nobody knows where we will all be in 12 months time and therefore it would be impossible to give any guarantee. I take the point made by both Deputies. The basic problem is that the drafting process and the legislative process in general are so slow that this legislation could have and probably should have been put through the House some considerable time ago. While it is nobody&rsquo;s fault that this has not happened, it is now going through. If improvements can be made, and I agree with everybody that there should be some, they should come back to the House more quickly next time and be passed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>While I accept that delays can occur, the wonderful Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to be able to introduce Bills overnight when he wants to do so, which indicates that it can be done and certainly with a Bill as small as this, on which we all more or less agree. I will accept that the Minister of State will try to push changes as quickly as possible next time around. I believe such changes will be recommended as we have moved on considerably in the past four or five years and people realise how important parental leave is for both parents and how essential it is for children to have their parents available at certain times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, line 27, to delete &ldquo;8 years&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;12 years or completes his or her primary schooling, whichever is the sooner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We debated this matter on Committee Stage and we seem to be like parrots repeating ourselves. I am asking that the age limit be increased from eight to 12 or 13, to match the years a child is in <Col N="63"/>primary school. I cannot see any reason not to make this amendment. While I accept that some of these details need to be negotiated at partnership talks etc., and while I do not like that we cannot make decisions in this House, I can understand it. I can understand the feelings of the Minister of State on the previous set of amendments. However, on this one I cannot accept it as it will not affect anybody and would make life easier for the employers who might oppose it at partnership talks because it would allow for greater flexibility and would have less impact. If an employee has 12 years to take parental leave, the pinch will be smaller compared with somebody taking large blocks of parental leave over an eight-year period.</P>
      <P>I do not see why this cannot be accepted. I cannot find any research indicating that this cannot be done. I agree that there was a battle to get the limit changed to eight years. However, I do not believe we would be seen to be taking negotiations for granted by allowing this amendment. If we are afraid it would affect the existing arrangements of parents whose children are now, for example, seven, it could be provided that it only affects children now under six. The Minister of State should not rule out this amendment just because it has not been discussed at partnership talks. This is different from the other amendments. It would not hurt anybody and would give parents greater flexibility.</P>
      <P>The final years of primary school when children are preparing for secondary school are vital. It is estimated that 1,000 children each year leave primary school and do not progress to secondary school and the figure could be considerably higher. Children are under pressure and need their parents to be there for them as much as they can. While the early years up to the age of three or four are the most important, the years when a child is eight, nine, ten and 11 are also vital. Children are growing up very fast and have many questions to ask. While it would be great if parents could always be there for them when they come home from school, that is a dream world and is not possible. However, this House should do whatever it can to facilitate flexibility for parents to bring up their children and spend time with them when they believe it is best. Extending the period within which they can do so would not cause much trouble to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy on this matter. We will give employers greater flexibility if we extend the time, particularly if we continue to allow it at 14 weeks. I take it that the approach to this Bill on the part of the Government and those involved in centralised bargaining was more concerned with employment than with how we treat our children, which is very unfortunate. It is also unfortunate that we see the child as a com<Col N="64"/>modity that should be given as little time, affection and consideration as possible. The Department is concerned with protecting employers and those involved in centralised bargaining are concerned with ascertaining the benefits they can get for workers. The child gets lost in that process.</P>
      <P>The proposal to allow one to take parental leave until one&rsquo;s child is 12 years of age or until the end of the child&rsquo;s time in primary school &mdash; they can often happen at the same time &mdash; will offer greater flexibility from the employer&rsquo;s point of view. Not all children need the same type of attention in fourth, fifth and sixth classes. Some children sail through that period of their lives &mdash; they are probably the happiest years of their lives &mdash; but others need more parental support as they move on a little at the ages of nine, ten or 11. A great deal of bullying can take place during such years, which can mean that additional support is needed.</P>
      <P>It is important that we provide for more flexibility in the system. We should avoid the rigidity we see in this legislation. Those of us with experience of children &mdash; I do not just refer to parents because there are other ways of encountering children, for example through one&rsquo;s extended family &mdash; know that children behave differently. Although they have certain fundamental needs, their overall level of need can differ significantly. If we extend the number of years within which one can take parental leave, we will give employers greater flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provisions in amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are contrary to the agreement that was reached by the social partners during the negotiations on Sustaining Progress. Therefore, as I have said, I cannot consider the amendments, unfortunately. Amendment No. 6 proposes to add a new element to the Bill by extending to three years the period of time available to the adopting parents of a child who is the subject of an adoption order. As this proposal has not been discussed by the social partners, it is impossible for me to accept it. I do not wish to be repetitive in stating again that while I understand the rationale for the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments, I simply cannot go beyond the agreement that was reached in Sustaining Progress. Therefore, I have to reject the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity the Minister of State cannot consider these amendments. It would not hurt anybody too much to make the changes I have suggested. As I said, I do not think the voices of children are being heard at the partnership talks. If periods of leave like that under discussion are not increased and parents are not given an extra chance, it is a great shame. I accept that there are competing demands at the partnership talks, but we have to give children greater opportunities and give parents extra help. It is a <Col N="65"/>shame that the Minister of State cannot take a step forward by accepting these amendments. I do not believe they would affect anybody or upset those involved in the partnership talks. Given that the Government has held the line on every other issue, the social partners will not beat it with a stick for backing down by accepting one small amendment that will not really affect anybody. It is a shame if that is the way it will be. The pressures of life mean that parents need greater flexibility when they are making their plans. Things can happen to children which mean that parents need to take leave. The opportunity to facilitate that will be lost if these amendments are not accepted.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">3.&mdash;Section 6 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (7) by&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) inserting &ldquo;and where they are both employed by the same employer&rdquo; after &ldquo;child&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, and</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) substituting &ldquo;either parent&rdquo; for &ldquo;neither of the parents&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I proposed this amendment to try to give parents some flexibility in planning their lives in the early years of the lives of their children. The wording of the amendment I proposed in this regard on Committee Stage was slightly wrong as it placed an undue burden on the employer of one of the parents. I have changed the wording to ensure that parents will be allowed to share the allotted leave if they &ldquo;are both employed by the same employer&rdquo; or in the same company.</P>
      <P>The original Bill quite clearly provides for parental leave of 14 weeks per parent per child and that is probably it. I accept the logic of that provision. The Minister agreed on Committee Stage to review and consider my suggestion. If both parents work for the same company or the same employer, it might suit all involved if one parent is allowed to use the other parent&rsquo;s leave. We should give them that right, up to a maximum of 28 weeks leave. I would like to provide for more than 28 weeks leave, but that is an argument I lost earlier today.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am proposing that one parent should be allowed to take 28 weeks leave, or that one parent should be allowed to take 20 weeks and the other parent eight weeks, for example, subject to the agreement of the employer or the company. We should allow them to divide their leave in that way if they want to do so. I understand that the law as it stands prevents them from sharing their leave, which denies them the flexibility to which they are entitled. It might not suit a parent to take 14 weeks' unpaid leave, or it might not suit the employer to allow that person to take that time off. It might be handy and useful to <Col N="67"/>allow both parents to combine their leave so that it is taken by one of them. I cannot envisage how this proposal will affect anybody negatively. I accept that we need to make it clear, as with other amendments, that such an arrangement is to be made with the agreement of the employer. If the employer cannot agree to such alternative leave arrangements, that is fair enough, but we should allow all concerned to come to such an agreement if possible.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention something else that is important in the context of the debate on the 28 weeks leave. It is quite often the case that both halves of a couple are employed by the same company. One person in such a family unit might be working at a higher grade or earning a higher wage than the other. Given that paternal leave is unpaid, it might be more financially viable for the two people in question to ensure that the person on the lower wage takes all the leave available, but that is not always possible. Many families might not be able to afford to allow both parents to take all the leave that is available to them. We should do all we can to provide for the flexibility that is needed by parents in managing their family affairs. We should not put brick walls in their way. We should provide for that flexibility as long as it does not affect anybody else. We should stand back and let parents make their own arrangements because they know best. It is not up to us to dictate to them. We should do all we can to help out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all right. I wanted to make sure of the arrangements. I support amendment No. 10, in the name of Deputy English. I know several instances where both partners work for the same company and there can be a lack of flexibility in the arrangements that such people can make. I accept that the Minister of State is very much constrained by the negotiations that took place four years ago. I do not believe he should be, by the way, but I accept that he is. I am not convinced that the people who negotiated this package looked at this in any detail. I may be doing them an injustice, however. If they did, perhaps they could not negotiate certain areas of it. If I am doing them an injustice, it is not intentional.</P>
      <P>There are examples where couples work at the same employment and where both individuals would like to take time off to care for or just sim<Col N="68"/>ply be with their children on particular occasions. I do not understand why this was not envisaged in this legislation. I believe I know who represented this area in those negotiations and it strikes me that they are capable and competent people and that they are well versed in this area. It amazes me that this issue was left out, as were others. As Deputy English said, in a previous contribution, life has moved on dramatically in Ireland since that time. It has moved on more dramatically for families and women than for any other group in society. I hope that the people who are now in negotiations on this particular issue are listening to this debate, that they are open to the type of representations in respect of it made to us, as politicians, and that these issues will be clarified sooner rather than later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, to delete lines 11 to 15 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p1- ?>&ldquo;(<i>aa</i>) 2 separate periods or a continuous period on the basis of one or two days per week until the 14 weeks entitlement is exhausted,</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>ab</i>) employees (or their representatives) shall have the right to request more flexible Parental Leave arrangements than those provided under the <i>Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2006</i>, whereby employers shall be obliged to give serious consideration to such requests and whereby refusal of such a request shall only be permitted where the employer has demonstrated a compelling business case why he or she cannot assent to the request,&ldquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The report of the maternity leave working group recommended that paternity leave be dealt with as part of the Paternal Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004. That was some considerable time ago and yet paternity leave has not been facilitated. That is most unfortunate because we will now have to wait some considerable time for that issue to be <Col N="69"/>dealt with. It would have been dealt with adequately in amendment No. 1 had that been accepted, or could be dealt with under amendment No. 19.</P>
      <P>As regards paternity leave, Spain has provided two days, France two weeks and Norway four weeks. Even in Northern Ireland, under the old imperialist warmonger, Mrs Thatcher, and her successors, they have two weeks. This State is the worst in Europe in this regard. It is most unfortunate that this opportunity was not taken to deal with this important and essential issue.</P>
      <P>I make the case in amendment No. 11 that there is a need for increased flexibility. I go along with same arguments made by Deputies English and Lynch in respect of amendment No. 9, which referred to increased flexibility. This amendment offers significant flexibility to both employers and employees. If the entitlement to paid leave is to be of any value, especially to low-paid parents, then there must be flexibility. The majority of low-paid workers simply cannot afford to take big chunks of leave as provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The essence of what I propose will facilitate current practice among some good employers. I know people who are permitted by employers to take their leave on a one day per week basis. They work four days and take one day off per week because they simply cannot afford to take two weeks off work, with mortgages and all types of other costs to be met. At least they are getting some degree of benefit and this is already happening among progressive employers. I am asking the Minister of State to provide for that in this Bill by accepting this amendment. Incidentally, the position advanced in this amendment is strongly supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.</P>
      <P>Should we as politicians have representatives from all the social partners with us when we come to contest the next general election in the year ahead so that they can canvass or advocate their respective positions? I find it unacceptable that they are the people, outside the House, controlling the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments that are being taken together. Amendment No. 11 is similar to the amendment being tabled by Deputy Lynch, or at least the concept is the same. I agree with Deputy Morgan that this is happening anyway among good employers. Many people cannot afford to take unpaid leave. All we can do as legislators is facilitate matters. I believe the Minister of State is likely to accept this amendment. It is not asking for a great deal, just for slightly more flexibility. Employers still have the right to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; as long as they can give a good enough reason. The majority of employers are excellent and do what they can for their employees. However, there will always be the few awkward individuals who will make life difficult, mainly <Col N="70"/>because they like to bully. For no apparent good reasons they will tend to block arrangements such as this and make life difficult for employers, and that is a pity. Our job is try to prevent this and to encourage good employers to do what is right for their workers when they can.</P>
      <P>We all accept that it might not always be possible to be flexible and to give employees what they need. However, when there is no justifiable business reason, such leave should not be blocked. We are merely trying to facilitate matters and encourage such initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>When dealing with legislation that affects children of a very young age, the main concern should be flexibility. That is all the amendment asks. There will be times when a manufacturer in September, for example, is preparing to fulfil an order for the Christmas market. Everyone accepts that it might not be possible for someone to take the extended time-off entitlement at that time. The same goes for the catering trade, restaurants, hotels, etc. leading up to the Christmas period. Again, it is understandable if employers tell staff that they just cannot be spared at that particular time, and offer to review matters later.</P>
      <P>However, it is a question of flexibility and Deputy Morgan is quite right. Many good employers in this country are already being flexible. We all know working women who take a half day, day or two days off every week. That type of flexibility exists. If we were all flawless, there would be no need for governance, legislation and social controls. However, that is not how the world works. There are inflexible people who believe there should be no parental leave or maternity leave and that if parents choose to have a child, that is their responsibility. We hear such people often enough on radio programmes. They believe there is no social obligation to ensure that the future population of this country is treated with any respect or dignity. We need to legislate to ensure that such people do not have a free run and are not allowed to take positions contrary to the law enacted in this House. We are not here to force good employers into doing things they do not want to do anyway. We are here to ensure that good employees remain in the workforce and are not forced out of it by unreasonable employers. It is all about the old buzzword &mdash; flexibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not at all sure a prescriptive amendment like this would do anything for flexibility. The spirit of the section containing this provision is one of co-operation between employer and employee so that where it suits both the employer and the employee, they may agree together that parental leave may be taken in whatever fashion they jointly decide.</P><Col N="71"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>This amendment ignores the day-to-day reality of running a business or providing a service which relies on the presence of the required number of employees at any given time. The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment effectively means that an employee would be guaranteed whatever flexibility is desired unless the employer could demonstrate in every case why a refusal was justified on business case grounds, thus placing an unnecessary administrative burden on employers.</P>
      <P>The reality is that many employers and their employees already have flexible parental leave schemes negotiated and in place. I am not at all convinced that employers are likely to be more amenable to flexibility because they are obliged to respond in a prescribed way to requests for greater flexibility on how parental leave may be taken. I think this is a very bad amendment and I reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject and refute what the Minister of State has just said. Amendment No. 11 provides specifically for the employer who can produce a compelling business case to be exempt from the terms of the flexibility on the basis of what we have already said in the course of this debate. By not accepting this amendment, in effect, the Minister of State is protecting wayward employers who deserve no protection in instances where there is no compelling business case and where flexibility should be allowed. We have built that into the amendment. That is part of it. It is worthless and pointless for the Minister to hide behind excuses in this case.</P>
      <P>The aim of the amendment is to provide employees with an opportunity to request flexible time from their employers. If that can be provided everybody can live together happily ever after. If it cannot be provided then the employer only has to produce a compelling business case. That is not a big deal in terms of administration for any decent employer. I agree with previous speakers. We all recognise that the majority of employers in this State are reasonable people and we would expect them to get on and deal with an amendment such as this. The complete inflexibility on the part of the Minister of State seeks to protect wayward employers. It is most unfortunate that a more progressive view of this cannot be taken so that we can deal with this issue once and for all. It is what is already happening in a substantial number of places and the Minister of State should not seek to protect wayward and unscrupulous employers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill is the third of three key items of legislation promoting work-life balance which the Government committed to implement under the Sustaining Progress agreement. I am pleased that it has been possible to implement each of those legislative commitments in full, although I agree with the Opposition that it has taken much longer than it should have.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements to maternity leave provisions were implemented by the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 which was commenced on 18 October 2004. The adoptive leave provisions for working parents were also greatly improved by the Adoptive Leave Act 2005 which was commenced on 28 November 2005. The duration of adoptive and maternity leave, both paid and unpaid, has increased significantly. The duration of paid adoptive and maternity leave was increased on 1 March 2006 to 20 and 22 weeks respectively, with additional unpaid adoptive and maternity leave increasing to 12 weeks. My Department has also put legislation in place to give effect to a further round of increases on 1 March 2007 which will bring adoptive leave to 24 weeks&rsquo; duration and paid maternity leave to 26 weeks. The duration of additional unpaid adoptive and maternity leave will also be increased by a further four weeks to 16 weeks on 1 March 2007.</P>
      <P>I thank the Members for their contributions to the debate on this Bill. As Deputies will be aware, the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill implements the commitments which have been made in Sustaining Progress partnership agreement which limited the scope for amendments in this Bill given the requirements to adhere to the <Col N="75"/>agreements reached between the social partners. I thank the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Members of the House and my departmental staff for their work on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>From time to time when Opposition Members must engage with the Government on legislation, it may seem to be very rancorous and confrontational. This is the nature of Parliament. As the Minister of State has said, this Bill is part of a substantial baseline body of legislation on the subject of maternity and the provision of child care relief when a new person comes into the house. I compliment the Minister of State on bringing forward those three pieces of legislation. We will all admit that this Bill was a bit longer in coming than the others. It should not take too much work to update those pieces of legislation to improve them and bring us somewhere nearer to what our European neighbours consider to be the norm.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the efficient manner in which it conducted the debate and the Minister of State for being forthright and frank with us regarding the things he could and could not do. I thank his departmental staff who clearly have done considerable work on these pieces of legislation. Families are waiting for this Bill and for the other two Bills which have been dealt with in the recent past. It is the case that we are all out working and are very busy and owing to financial commitments, we cannot afford to take the time off which we want to spend with our children. Government is about ensuring we have some degree of work-life balance. These pieces of legislation which have been updated, improved, expanded and increased will make life much easier of all of us and will make this a society rather than an economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted with this Bill but the Opposition will look for more. The opportunity was missed to introduce some form of paid benefit and I hope this will be introduced in any changes to the Bill. Many people cannot afford to take time off, especially considering the expenses associated with raising children and even the expense of living without children. I hope the Government will press this point during the talks, as will other groups. I hope the Bill will be updated soon. The last three Bills dealing with this subject have proposed significant improvements and there appears to be a recognition that they should be fast-tracked.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the quick passage of this Bill. I am impressed that he accepted amendments where possible and I understand his reasons for not accepting others, even though I would not agree with him. It may well be the same for us when we are on that side of the House in 12 or 13 months&rsquo; time.</P><Col N="76"/>
      <P>An opportunity was missed when dealing with the Adoptive Leave Act to recognise the changing patterns in society. The rights and responsibilities of fathers and their role in child rearing has changed greatly. The Adoptive Leave Act did not recognise this fact. It is up to this House to prove to the country that we expect change and that we are willing to lead that change. We should make it clear that fathers must be just as responsible and as involved as mothers. The day is gone when the mother at home did all the child rearing. This House should show a lead in this matter. If this is equality then we should expect it from both parents. It may not always happen and in most cases the mother may still end up carrying the brunt of the work in the house and rearing the children. For various reasons the House missed its opportunity in the Adoptive Leave Act to facilitate both parents taking an equal amount of the workload.</P>
      <P>This is a 21st century society and we must move with the times. We are still a good way off the standards of our European counterparts in many areas but we are getting there. I get annoyed because I want our young people to have the same opportunities as young people in other countries. Parents should be encouraged to spend as much time as possible with their children and even though this becomes more difficult to achieve every year, we are getting there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>

I was tempted to call a vote at one stage but we wanted to see it dealt with and I am pleased it has been. A phrase used in Louth and Meath would accurately describe the Bill as being middling enough legislation which could have been much better. Issues such as paternity leave should have been dealt with in this Bill. A number of Opposition amendments would have improved the Bill significantly. Like my colleagues, I hope we will be in a position, sooner rather than later, to move those amendments and ensure they are included to improve the legislation at a later date.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006. I refer to the key statement made in section 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">9B.&mdash;(1) It shall be, and be deemed always to have been, a function of the Commission to participate in the development of an all-island energy market, including the preparation of proposals and the provision of advice to the Minister in regard to any part or aspect of the establishment, management and operation of such a market.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is opportune that the House is discussing this Bill when energy is such a concern as a result of the rise in oil prices. That rise, global instability and general acceptance that oil reserves will grow ever less dependable should act as a wake-up call to those who think we can continue as we are and not risk major economic problems in the decades ahead.</P>
      <P>In 2003 the price of a barrel of oil was $35 while this year it is well in excess of $70. Economists warn that the day may not be far off when it will reach $120 a barrel. Even natural disasters such as the devastating hurricane Katrina put upward pressure on oil prices and demonstrate the susceptibility of Ireland&rsquo;s economy to events beyond our control. Coupled with this price pressure are the repercussions of Ireland&rsquo;s failure to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Agreement.</P>
      <P>To neutralise the effect of global warming on the earth&rsquo;s population, it is generally agreed that the level of global greenhouse gas emissions will need to be reduced by 70% by 2100. As a first step, the 1997 Kyoto Agreement was drawn up with the aim of reducing global emissions of greenhouse gasses by 2012 by 5.2% based on 1990 levels. Under the agreement, to which Ireland is a signatory, this country undertook to limit the increase of these emissions in 2008-12 to only 13% based on the level of emissions in 1990. Without action, it is estimated that our emissions will rise by 37%, almost three times the permissible level. Currently, we are at 25% above our 1990 levels. If agreed commitments on emissions are not met, Ireland will face a bill of up to &euro;400 million.</P>
      <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland states that renewable energy has been contributing nearly 2% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy supply since 1990. Most of this has been delivered by traditional biomass, waste wood used by the timber processing industry for drying and wood burnt by the residential sector for home heating. The second most significant contribution has been from the large-scale <Col N="78"/>hydro power plants, whose output has varied from year to year depending on rainfall patterns. The growing contribution from wind energy is also evident. In 2003, biomass contributed 1.2%, hydro power 0.34% and wind energy 0.26% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements. However, as the price of oil increases even more and supply becomes less secure, we must try to strike a better balance. Our European partners already have made a start. In 2001, Austria was sourcing 22% of its energy consumption from renewable sources.</P>
      <P>The first step to tackling Ireland&rsquo;s energy crisis lies with how we use energy at home and at work. Statistics show the following. Between 1990 and 2003 coal usage dropped by 52% and the share of coal fell from 27% to 10%. Sod peat usage dropped by 69% and its share fell from 26% to 6.4% over the period. Peat briquette usage reduced by 40% and its share fell from 7.1% to 3.4%. For briquette usage there was a large reduction of 17% in 2003 alone, but oil usage increased by 195% and its share in the residential sector grew from 16% to 37%. Natural gas usage increased even more significantly, by 360%, or 12% per annum, and its share rose from 5.4% to 19.5%. Renewable &mdash; mainly wood &mdash; usage increased slightly by 1.2% but its share dropped from 1.9% to 1.6%. Given the inexorable rise in the price of oil, the huge increase in the use of natural gas and the worrying drop in the use of renewable energy to heat our homes, something must be done.</P>
      <P>According to the strategy report of the campaign for take-off for renewable heat pumps in Ireland, produced by Arsenal Research for Sustainable Energy Ireland, of the 1.2 million dwellings in Ireland, three quarters were built prior to the introduction of the draft Irish building regulations in 1976. Some 86% were built before the more stringent 1991 building regulations. This implies that some degree of energy inefficiency exists in most Irish dwellings. The report states:</P>
      <P LI="1">Irish insulation levels are among the poorest in Northern Europe. The extent of double-glazed windows, at 36%, is very low relative to other countries. Ground floor insulation, at one-in-four households, is likewise paltry. Similarly, less than two-in-four households have draught sealing or wall insulation.</P>
      <P FLI="0">To tackle this, householders and businesses must be grant-aided to ensure that heat is not lost and energy is not consumed unnecessarily. Sustainable Energy Ireland states that insulating the 50 sq. m. attic space of a typical house costs approximately &euro;254 and could save approximately &euro;76 a year. It would, therefore, pay for itself in about three years.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Using alternative energy sources and moving away from the burning of fossil fuels makes sound environmental and economic sense. Unfortu<Col N="79"/>nately, the initial capital outlay can deter householders and businesses from making the switch. In Britain, the Clear Skies programme has sought to remedy this. Funded by the Department of Trade and Industry and managed by Building Research Establishment, Clear Skies aims to give householders and communities a chance to realise the benefits of renewable energy by providing grants and access to sources of advice. Householders can obtain grants of between &pound;400 and &pound;5,000, while not-for-profit community organisations can receive up to &pound;50,000 in grants. Grants are given to the following renewable energy installations: solar thermal, wind turbines, micro-small-scale hydro turbines, ground source heat pumps, room heaters-stoves with automated wood pellet feed and wood fuelled boiler systems. The model has been a success in the UK and the scheme has offered grants to 6,562 households and 304 community organisations. In 2006, the Government finally moved on this important agenda and it is time to move further still.</P>
      <P>The economic case for a move to generating electricity from alternative energy sources is unquestionable. At present, only approximately 4% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is generated from renewable sources. This compares to 47% generated from natural gas, 26% from coal and 12% from oil. That involves costly extraction methods, ever increasing importation costs and, above all, a total lack of stability. Our economy cannot withstand this. It is imperative that the mix of sources from which we derive our electricity is improved. My party believes that it is eminently possible to shift our dependence from imported non-renewables to indigenous, renewable energy for electricity generation.</P>
      <P>Wind energy is vital in the effort to meet our Kyoto targets. A number of problems exist with wind energy: cost; structural problems, including the control of the national grid by the dominant supplier and generator of electricity; planning problems, which we all have experienced, including the lack of a national policy favouring the construction of wind farms from which the relevant authorities can take a lead; and reliability, which, with our climate, is probably greater here than in most countries. My party believes these problems can be overcome and wind energy can play a large part in meeting our energy needs.</P>
      <P Just="Left">According to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, landfill remains the predominant waste management practice in Ireland. An estimated 1,901,864 tonnes of municipal waste, or 79%, was consigned to landfill in Ireland in 2002. At landfill, bacteria cause the organic fraction of deposited waste to decompose under partially anaerobic conditions, producing a biogas. This biogas consists primarily of methane and carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2:1, with small quantities of other gases also present. <Col N="80"/>Landfill gas emissions can be minimised through effective recovery systems which harness the gas and use it as a renewable and valuable fuel. In addition to electrical power generation, landfill gas can also be used for combined heat and power, for kiln firing and as a heating or vehicle fuel. Landfill gas is similar to natural or fossil gas and can be fed into the natural gas network.</P>
      <P>Nationally, Ireland&rsquo;s landfill capacity will last for roughly another ten years. It is vital that we use this period to make the most of the natural resource that landfill produces. In 2004 there were 34 authorised landfill sites in Ireland. Of these, only five have been developed to generate a total of 15 MW of electricity that is fed into the national grid. Development of these sites has been supported under the alternative energy requirement scheme run by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Meanwhile, our wastewater treatment plants provide all the inconvenience of a so-called &ldquo;disamenity&rdquo;, without any of the potential economic and environmental benefits, including the harnessing of valuable methane gas.</P>
      <P>Approximately half of the total amount of electricity generated from renewable energy sources comes from hydro energy. According to the report entitled Tidal and Current Energy Resources in Ireland, produced by Sustainable Energy Ireland and published in August 2005:</P>
      <P LI="1">There are many similarities between wind and tidal current generating systems both in terms of devices and the nature of the driving force. Compared to wind technology, tidal systems are in their infancy and there have been only a small number of prototype scale demonstrations of plant with an installed capacity of over 100kW. It is expected to take several years before items of equipment are produced for purchase and installation.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The same report states that hydro energy could produce approximately 2.18% of the predicted electricity consumption for the year 2010. This figure could increase to 6.27% of the predicted electricity consumption between 2010 and 2015.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s peat industry faces a major challenge in the years ahead. As our peat reserves are exhausted and existing peat contracts with Bord na M&oacute;na come up for renewal, it is important that other uses are found for the infrastructure in place while also examining the introduction of renewables as a source of fuel for electricity generation. Fine Gael proposes that grants of between &euro;500 and &euro;3,500 should be paid to householders wishing to convert their home heating to renewable energy. Grant aid to householders who wish to insulate their homes properly should be available up to &euro;500. With regard to electricity generation, we propose a move to generate 33% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity needs from renewable resources by 2025. We will consider a <Col N="81"/>complete separation of the ESB from the national grid to ensure a level playing field for all energy suppliers.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael proposes that investment and commitment to wind energy should be predicated on the putting in place of the necessary interconnecting infrastructure which can ensure continuity of supply in the event of a reduction in supply from wind. We will seek to recover landfill gas in all landfill sites and waste water treatment plants as far as is practicable for electricity generation to be fed into the national grid and for private use. Fine Gael will increase research and development funding in the offshore hydroelectric sector to ensure established targets are met and commit to a review of progress with a view to exceeding those targets should conditions permit. Bord na M&oacute;na should be included in the overall development of energy policy given its experience and expertise as an energy provider and its ability to play a meaningful role.</P>
      <P>I refer to biofuels and the role of agriculture. Fine Gael proposes the abolition of all excise duty on biofuels produced from renewable energy crops and to establish grants for producer groups, which would comprise up to 50% of the costs of setting up the group, subject to a maximum of &euro;300,000 per group. We propose the reform of the energy crops scheme by examining whether the current rates of payment are adequate to promote energy crop expansion and whether the sugar beet crop should be included under the scheme to facilitate development of the bioethanol industry. A public competition for the establishment and operation of a number of biofuel processing plants, strategically located in a selected number of locations will be undertaken. Capital start-up grants for these processing plants would initially be provided to enable these plants to become established and begin viable processing operations. Fine Gael proposes greater links with international biofuel processors and-or fuel suppliers and the relevant Departments, especially the Departments of Transport and Agriculture and Food, to facilitate the promotion of the biofuels industry. A public awareness and promotion campaign will be undertaken to encourage the growth of biofuels. Throughout the public and private forestry sector, the growing of trees with a high carbon sequestration capacity to make a further contribution to meeting Kyoto requirements will be encouraged.</P>
      <P>Clear targets should be set for the wood energy sector in Ireland. No targets are in place to allow for the replacement of imported fossil fuels with domestic wood energy. Targets and a clear policy direction would promote better forest management and stimulate the growth of the forestry sector. Forestry grants must be repositioned to promote and develop sustainable forestry. There must be a greater focus on the potential of a vibrant forestry sector through alternative timber <Col N="82"/>use to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. In particular, there must be a greater emphasis on short rotation coppice forestry such as willow.</P>
      <P>With regard to transport, a significant shift in the allocation of capital transport funding is necessary to facilitate a meaningful increase in the development of public transport infrastructure projects. Vehicle registration tax, VRT, will be reformed by Fine Gael through the establishment of a system of energy efficiency labelling for motor vehicles, with lower rates of VRT for those cars with more efficient engines, and we will create a market for biofuels by legislating to provide that all motor fuels must include a blend of fuel from renewable sources. All petrol sold at filling stations will include a 5% bioethanol mix and all diesels will contain a 2% bio-diesel mix. An immediate increase in the number of buses providing commuter services into our major cities should be introduced, especially feeder buses to rail connections.</P>
      <P>A public transport regulator should be established as a priority with the aim of assisting in the provision of increased public transport services. Action should be taken on the provision of increased rail services as a viable transport solution to reduce dramatically our current reliance on the car. All public transport vehicles and public service vehicles should be required to convert, where practical and feasible, to forms of biofuel, whether in a pure or blended form.</P>
      <P>A centre of excellence for alternative energy should be established, charged with ensuring Ireland develops a world class alternative energy sector. The centre should incorporate the existing Sustainable Energy Ireland and should be located within an institute of technology with outreach points in other academic institutions nationwide.</P>
      <P>With regard to planning for the future, Fine Gael proposes that all public buildings should run on alternative energy sources as soon as is practicable and feasible. The national spatial strategy should include major renewable energy infrastructure projects. Our renewable energy infrastructure should constitute an element of regional development plans, while a community dividend should be provided to act as compensation for those living close to important infrastructure that aids the entire country reach its alternative energy commitments. Fine Gael is committed to these proposals and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to be the first to place them on the record of the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Bill. Since the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was established at the commencement of this D&aacute;il, two Ministers and three Ministers of State have been appointed to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Deputy Broughan, Deputy Ryan and I have been committee <Col N="83"/>members since October 2002. While I do not take away from the contribution of other committee members, we are the longest serving members and we hold a certain responsibility because we have detailed knowledge of the energy issues faced by the State.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On 25 occasions over two years the committee dealt with energy and natural resources issues. We received presentations from the Department, the current Minister and his predecessor on five occasions, the Commission on Energy Regulation on four occasions, Sustainable Energy Ireland on three occasions, the ESB on three occasions, Airtricity, the Irish Wind Energy Association, Meitheal na Gaoithe, Viridian Power and Energy, ESB National Grid, Bord G&aacute;is, Cork City Council, Cork City Energy Agency, Coillte, COFORD, Teagasc, Clearpower Limited, the IFA, the Irish Bioenergy Association, Burton Bioenergy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Economic and Social Research Institute, IBEC, Dr. Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir of UCC, Mr. Mark O&rsquo;Malley of UCD, Bord na M&oacute;na, Ballina Chamber of Commerce, the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation, Mr. Colin Campbell and Mr. Chris Skrebowski on global oil production, the Bantry Concerned Action Group on difficulties of getting connections to the national grid, the Consumers Association of Ireland, Professor Awerbuch, an energy economist, Mr. Paul Hunt, a UK-based energy consultant, Ms. Anne Grete Holmsgaard of the Danish Parliament and concluding with the European Commissioner for Energy, Andris Piebalgs.</P>
      <P>We expect to publish our report shortly. We had a meeting today and we are finalising the recommendations. I hope that we can have consensus, even though there are different views within the committee. I hope to publish the report based on the findings and the public hearings of the committee over the past two years. I hope it will be received by the Department and the Minister and that the recommendations form part of the policy decisions to be made in the future.</P>
      <P>There are major energy issues facing Ireland. When he recently met the committee, Commissioner Piebalgs identified the six main issues facing Europe, namely, fully competitive energy markets in Europe, security of supply, energy mix, a climate change goal, technology and external energy policy. If these are the concerns of Europe, then they must be the concerns of Ireland. Some of these are being addressed in this Bill and I welcome the moves to facilitate full gas market opening, the underpinning of the all-island energy market, granting power to the Minister to provide for the taking of emergency measures by ministerial order in the event of a sudden crisis in the energy market, the conferring of the power on the Minister to issue policy direc<Col N="84"/>tions to the CER, the expansion of the functions of the CER and the removal of the legislative constraints to facilitate regulated electricity interconnection not owned by the ESB.</P>
      <P>However, these last few points give rise to a concern of mine about regulation. We set up the CER and a major thrust of this Bill is the correction of deficiencies in the workings of regulation. Regulation is here to stay, be that as an EU-imposed need to have regulation or a Government move to have regulation. Since I was elected to the D&aacute;il we have moved to regulate all sorts of operations. We have a financial regulator, an aviation regulator and ComReg to regulate the telecom sector. We are awash with regulators and every time I hear of a proposal to set up a regulator, I believe we are inventing the wheel all over again. Surely it is not beyond our ability to have joined-up thinking on regulation and produce a generic model for regulation regardless of the sector or industry that is being regulated. For such a model of generic regulation all that is needed is to bolt on the specifics that are relevant to that industry or sector.</P>
      <P>No legislative proposal to set up a regulator should come before this House where that legislation does not give the Minister the ability to issue a policy direction to the regulator being set up. After all, that is one of the issues we are dealing with in this Bill and the Minister has the power to issue policy direction for ComReg. This applies not only to the areas under the remit of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources but also to any regulator that may be established in future or that has already been established.</P>
      <P>For the health, transport or sports sectors, we should have one model of regulation and implement this across all areas of Government and only add on to this base model of regulation the specifics relative to the area being regulated. I suggest that this could also apply to the setting up of any ombudsman. In this instance, we should also have a generic model that has the same standards across any office where there is an ombudsman with only the specifics having to be added on. I am tired of constantly designing the wheel as if we were living in a land where everyone was ignorant of its invention.</P>
      <P>This leads me on to another concern of mine, which is the working of the regulatory impact analysis or assessment. I welcome the introduction and I look forward to the full implementation of the regulatory impact analysis to every legislative proposal, be it primary legislation in the Bills that come before this House or in statutory instruments. The Taoiseach is to be congratulated for his initiative. I want to see the day when the regulatory impact analysis is embedded in the DNA of the entire Civil and public service. I use the phrase &ldquo;embedded in the DNA&rdquo; because I first came across it when a member of <Col N="85"/>staff in the Department of the Taoiseach made a presentation to the joint committee.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the RIA process expanded to include an impact assessment of the effectiveness of the regulation regime. Therefore, when a Bill has passed Second Stage and is referred to a select committee, that committee could review the RIA before it considers the Bill on Committee Stage. A legislative process such as a committee reviewing an RIA would have been of enormous benefit in the case of the recent Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 which caused so much concern and division in this House and in the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I commend this Bill and look forward to a good debate when it is referred to the committee. I hope the Government takes on board the comments I have made about a generic model of regulation and the regulatory impact analysis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This Bill at long last seeks to give this country a more complete energy policy and that in itself is welcome but, like the curate&rsquo;s egg, it is merely good in parts. The energy and fuel landscape has changed and is changing radically. The move away from a confined number of fuel supplying countries to a more expanded market and efforts to secure long-term supplies of energy need common policy with our EU partners. In that respect the Bill is welcome, but the simple truth remains that this movement has more or less passed us by owing to the inaction and lack of forward planning by the Government. Our dependence on traditional fuel supplies has increased when, all around us, warnings were given that such reserves were dwindling and that alternative energies should be sourced.</P>
      <P>Nobody would argue against the proposal for an all-island energy market, while the need to achieve advanced interconnection with Britain and Northern Ireland is urgent. In a recent written question that I put to the Minister, I received a reply that planning for the construction of a North-South interconnector is advanced and that it could be operational by the year 2012. If this Government was serious about energy, these interconnectors would have been up and running long before now and shortly after it came to power in 1997.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Energy is another area in which it appears that the Government has no head in that it only takes action when hounded to doing so.</P>
      <P>It is most welcome that measures are being introduced to regulate electricity and gas installations and to provide safety in the industry because poor standards have applied in this area for far too long. It is a minor miracle that there have not been more deaths in the construction of <Col N="86"/>buildings and the installation of electricity and gas facilities. I welcome any measure which improves safety in the industry, however late its introduction.</P>
      <P>This Bill confers upon the Minister the power to issue policy directions to the Commission for Energy Regulation, a body which was set up as an independent commission under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. The granting of this power to the Minister diminishes the independent standing of the commission and it is not enough to constrain his power by providing that he can only act upon the conclusion of a public consultation process. The commission is either independent or it is not. There should be no grey areas or ministerial interference in this matter.</P>
      <P>Provisions are made in the Bill for the taking of emergency measures by means of ministerial order in the event of a sudden crisis in the energy market and for price regulation of the market. It will be interesting to learn how this Minister will construe a crisis, given that it took the T&aacute;naiste years to wake up to the fact that a crisis existed in the health service. It is a pity she did not have similar emergency powers.</P>
      <P>At a time when fuel prices are rising, ordinary consumers are being forced to pay more to heat their family homes and run their cars, and businesses are seeing their operational costs increase. The only issue clearly visible to the consumer is the increase in revenue this Government is collecting from the scandalously high rates of VAT it levies on fuel. In the recent past, when the Government was asked to temporarily reduce VAT on fuel, it resisted strongly because it feared that a precedent could be set that would be repeated in other sectors of industry. Precedent be damned &mdash; we should look after the ordinary citizens of this country because they elected us in the first place.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for increased inspection powers to monitor the installation and supply of electricity and gas throughout the country. In the past 18 months we have seen inspectorates fail to monitor nursing homes, the labour employment market and child care and cr&egrave;che facilities. Does anyone in their right mind think that an inspectorate in the area of electricity and gas will succeed when all around it have failed miserably?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea of establishing such an inspectorate is to be welcomed but, for once, we should grant the body with adequate resources, a full staff complement, proper financial backing and, most important of all, arm it with the power to take action where it finds shoddy standards.</P>
      <P>This Bill is good in parts but we should not settle for that. The bad should be cast aside and a long-term cross-party approach should be put <Col N="87"/>in place to allow us to meet EU directives and national requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, one of the effects of which will be to take the initial steps towards opening up an all-Ireland energy market. Energy is a major issue which impacts on every aspect our daily lives. Every time we use the word &ldquo;energy&rdquo; we think about how fuel is becoming more expensive on a daily basis. People in the transport sector can outline how much it costs to bring our goods to us. Renewable energy has received closer attention but action is needed in terms of increasing the percentage of energy taken from renewable sources.</P>
      <P>The ways in which we consume energy have changed in recent times. In the past, we depended mainly on coal and solid fuels but most homes are now oil or electricity dependent. Society must adapt to these changing consumption habits.</P>
      <P>We are all becoming experts on wars in the Middle East and their effects on our lives in terms of jobs and the price of energy. These issues have gone to the top of people&rsquo;s agenda.</P>
      <P>We should encourage greater use of renewable resources. If grants existed for housing insulation, the country would get a return on its investment one way or another. Many people now live in 3,000 sq. ft. houses, yet one home may be much more energy efficient than its neighbour. We should investigate these matters with a view to ensuring that houses can be more easily heated and less reliant on electricity.</P>
      <P>A single electricity market in Ireland will not merely provide opportunities for cheaper power through economies of scale but will also provide a better basis for dealing with the crucial issues of ensuring future security and diversity of supply. The Bill also clearly charts a course towards the logical concept of a genuine all-Ireland energy market and acknowledges the fact that two small energy markets on the island do not make sound economic sense. In European terms, we are unfortunate in not having a neighbouring country to which we can link for supplies. Energy stability throughout the island of Ireland will be a major factor in attracting inward investment. Many of our industries are leaving and the cost of operating in Ireland is a major disincentive for companies locating here. We have enough difficulties in retaining the jobs we already have here and companies have a big battle on their hands with this issue.</P>
      <P>As the island, North and South, is generally regarded as a single economic entity, it follows that a single electricity market is a logical next step. Ireland has the seventh most expensive energy prices among the 25 EU member states, largely due to a lack of competition among the two State companies, ESB and Bord G&aacute;is. This <Col N="88"/>expense makes it difficult for companies to create jobs here. It is important that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland look to the longer term of 2020 and beyond when considering future energy policies. North-South collaboration in an all-Ireland energy market as well as in electricity is the most effective way of going about this. An all-Ireland electricity market will have as its aim the provision of competitive, sustainable and reliable markets in electricity at the minimum cost because businesses need cost effective markets. This single market should also be capable of meeting the increasing electricity and energy requirements of the island in ways that are compatible with national and EU sustainable energy policies and targets.</P>
      <P>Policies should be developed to encourage and facilitate greater contributions from renewables, combined heat and power and energy efficiency. Renewable energy comes from energy sources which are continuously replenished by nature. The main sources of renewable energy are wind, solar energy, hydro power, wave and tidal energy. We are not making sufficient use of these resources and we should be harnessing them because they are free. Our power should come from these sources in future.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Costello and Burton. I welcome the opportunity to move Second Stage of this Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill, which aims to revamp the manner in which the electoral register is compiled and maintained and to take measures to stamp out electoral fraud. The purpose of the Electoral Registration Commissioner Bill 2005, is to establish the office of the electoral registration commissioner and to set out the duties of that office regarding the supervision of the performance by registration authorities of their obligations in the preparation and publication of electoral registers. In addition, the Bill provides for access by registration authorities to information held by third parties on persons resident within their registration areas and makes provision for the use of personal public service, PPS, numbers in connection with the registration of electors and with establishing the identity of persons applying for ballot papers at elections. I will return to the detailed provisions of the Bill.</P><Col N="89"/>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>This is probably one of the most important issues to be considered by the House before the next general election. It is a vitally important issue involving the integrity of our electoral system. The electoral register is in a shambles. Politicians of all parties make regular use of it and they know by experience it is incomplete and out of date. Virtually everyone in politics can recount experiences of canvassing in housing estates or blocks of flats where the names on the register bear little relationship to those living in these houses or apartments. I could give many examples from my constituency or from those of many of my colleagues. I will give just one example drawn to my attention by my colleague, Councillor Dominic Hannigan, who has reported entire estates of new homes with house after house having no registered voters. Rath Lodge in Ashbourne, reports Councillor Hannigan, has almost 200 homes but only a handful of registered voters. On a recent canvass in the area, he distributed scores or registration forms to residents who had never been offered them before.</P>
      <P>Problems with the electoral register are not new. For as long I have been in politics the electoral register has been a problem, with errors and inaccuracies common. However, the scale of the errors and inaccuracies is new and unprecedented. Again this is acknowledged across all parties. Nobody knows how inaccurate is the register. Research carried out by political analyst, Mr. Odran Flynn, and published in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> suggested the current register may be wrong by up to as many as 800,000 names. This includes people who have moved into an area but have never been included on the register, those who are dead, people who are entitled to vote but are not on the register, people who are double registered and those registered in constituencies in which they have no entitlement to a vote. Mr. Flynn considered a number of factors when coming to this figure. He points out that the most recently published electoral register has 3.129 million people on it. This is estimated to be 300,000 more than the number of Irish and British adult citizens in the State entitled to be on the register. However, 300,000 would assume every citizen in the State is on the register. This is rarely the case and the international norm would be to expect 80% to 85% of the electorate to be on the register. On this basis he estimates the register may be wrong by anything between 719,000 and 860,000.</P>
      <P>Mr. Flynn may have overestimated the scale of the problem. However, even if Mr. Flynn is only half right, or even a quarter right, we still have a huge problem. If the estimate is only half right, then the electoral register is out by 400,000. If the estimate is only a quarter right, the register is out by 200,000, well more than the population of Cork city. Such a level of inaccuracy, gives rise to two principal areas of concern: it deprives a <Col N="90"/>significant number of people of the democratic right to vote and provides potential for electoral fraud. The outcome of the next general election may be determined by the outcome in a handful of constituencies. It is unacceptable that the will of the people could be frustrated by those who are prepared to take advantage of the shambolic state of the register to perpetrate electoral fraud.</P>
      <P>Those involved in politics know that no real and sustained effort is being made by local authorities, which are charged with maintaining the register, to keep the register accurate and current. It is not a core activity of local authorities, does not rate highly on their lists of priorities and they have not been given the finance or resources to adequately do the job. By way of example I refer to an e-mail I received earlier today, one of the many I received on this issue. It obviously struck a chord with people who have had difficulties registering themselves or who know about the inaccuracies in the register. My correspondent moved home a few months ago and dropped into the local county council office to have his address changed on the electoral register. He was told the relevant forms were not available but the county council took his name and address and said he would be contacted. Three months later no contact had been made so he sourced the form himself and sent it to the relevant office. By way of contrast he described the energy of the television licence inspectors who were onto him like a shot. He writes:</P>
      <P LI="1">I have never held a TV licence in my own name before so I was not on their records. Two months after moving into my new abode I got a letter from An Post&rsquo;s TV licence services office stating that according to their computer database my address was not covered by a TV licence and urging me to buy one before I got a knock on the door.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The person rightly points out that when it comes to the collection of money the agencies of the State have no difficulty maintaining an accurate register of who lives where and of tracking them down with efficiency, but when it comes to establishing their entitlement to participate in our democratic system by voting a different standard and energy is applied.</P>
      <P>It would have taken only a fraction of the almost &euro;60 million wasted on an insecure, unreliable and unwanted electronic voting system, to provide the local authorities with the resources, facilities and modern technology to guarantee a register that is as accurate as possible. The process of updating the register has not kept pace with housing developments and with changes in the workforce and in work patterns. Since the last general election 300,000 new houses have been built. People are frequently out at work when local authority officials call to check voter registration. In addition, there has been a major <Col N="91"/>increase in private renting, a sector with a high turnover of tenants. The growth of so-called &ldquo;gated communities&rdquo;, flats and housing developments with no access to outsiders has created a new problem for those compiling the register.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting the Government has made a deliberate decision to allow the electoral register to fall into such disarray but it has failed in the duty to ensure that we have an accurate and reliable register. There may be some involved in Irish politics who are unscrupulous enough to take advantage of the electoral register to perpetrate electoral fraud. In every recent general election the destination of seats in some constituencies was determined by a handful of votes. We must not allow a situation to develop whereby the genuine wish of the electorate can be frustrated by electoral fraud using an inaccurate electoral register.</P>
      <P>Virtually from the introduction of partition until recent years electoral fraud was a major problem in Northern Ireland, but the authorities there have taken effective steps to curb this immoral, illegal and anti-democratic practice. A key part of this strategy has involved a more robust approach to the compilation of the electoral register. For example, I understand that following a major review of the system for registering voters, the number of entries on the electoral register fell by almost 20% in some constituencies. In the Falls ward in Belfast the electoral register was found to be 25% oversubscribed. Northern Ireland now operates a form of &ldquo;rolling electoral register&rdquo;, the integrity of which is constantly checked.</P>
      <P>The situation in regard to the electoral register in this State has gradually been getting worse. Despite concern in all political parties the Government has taken no action to improve the reliability and accuracy of the register. Indeed, the Government refused to avail of the unique opportunity offered by this weekend&rsquo;s census to update the register on a national basis. The Labour Party had suggested to the Government, prior to the conduct of the census, that census enumerators could and should be asked to carry a second form for the purpose of updating the electoral register. My colleague Deputy Quinn told the House that this could be done in a way which would not infringe the confidentiality of the census. Enumerators could present a second voter registration form to households and have it completed and returned separately to local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Government has missed a great opportunity to correct the voter register using the census process. Every single household in the country is being called to by enumerators, who will repeatedly call back to those households until all the forms are returned. This could have been the means to secure an accurate register but the <Col N="92"/>Government failed to act. There were reports over the weekend that the Government was considering sending census enumerators back into the field to update the register and that the Minister would bring proposals to Government today &mdash; I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response in that regard. That proposal would be a welcome development and would deal with the problem of the register for next year&rsquo;s election. However, it is not a permanent solution. There is a considerable gap between the taking of each census whereas the register needs to be updated annually.</P>
      <P>The Bill which the Labour Party proposes to deal with the problem of the electoral register on a permanent basis contains a number of features. The purpose of the Bill is to establish, at national level, the independent office of electoral registration commissioner. It spells out the duties of the commissioner in supervising the performance by local authorities of their statutory duties in preparing the electoral register. Specifically, the functions of the commissioner will be to supervise generally, co-ordinate, monitor and report on the performance by local authorities of their duties relating to the registration of electors; to carry out registration duties on behalf of local authorities, with their agreement or where the local authorities are in default of their statutory obligations; to make recommendations to the Minister on amendments to the law on electoral registration to secure a more comprehensive and timely registration of electors while safeguarding the integrity of the poll; to promote public awareness and information campaigns in regard to electoral registration requirements; and to provide local authorities with advisory, technical support and other ancillary services in connection with registration duties.</P>
      <P>The overall objectives of the commissioner are to ensure the comprehensive, accurate and timely registration of persons entitled to be registered as electors in an efficient and economical manner and to ensure that all necessary action is taken to prevent or detect the registration of those who are not entitled to be so registered and the registration of persons as electors in more than one registration area.</P>
      <P>The expenses of the commissioner are to be met by way of a financial contribution to be paid each year to the commissioner by the local authorities. The commissioner is required to ensure that his or her costs of operations are kept to a minimum and are not excessive. In default of payment by a registration authority of any amount owed by it, the amount involved will be deducted from any sums payable to that authority by any Department and will instead be paid to the commissioner.</P>
      <P>The commissioner will be entitled to issue advice and recommendations to local authorities to ensure the smooth and efficient registration of <Col N="93"/>electors and to secure uniformity of procedure throughout the State. He or she will also be enabled to provide services, assistance and other support. If the commissioner believes a local authority has failed to perform its registration duties, or has performed those duties in an unsatisfactory manner, and the response of the authority to any advice or recommendations issued or services, assistance or support offered to it is inadequate, the commissioner will be entitled to give a direction to the authority to carry out any necessary ameliorative action within a specified period. It is the duty of a registration authority to comply with directions given to it by the commissioner. If it fails to comply with a direction, the commissioner can then carry out the necessary action himself or herself. The local authority will be responsible for the costs of any such action.</P>
      <P>The Bill updates the provisions of the Electoral Act 1992 relating to the co-operation a local authority can expect from citizens in the electoral registration process and the information it can require, both from electors and third parties. To be satisfied as to the entitlement of a person to be registered as an elector, a local authority can require information sufficient to establish the public service identity of that person and his or her ordinary residence. &ldquo;Public service identity&rdquo; is defined by reference to the Social Welfare Acts and essentially consists of a person&rsquo;s PPS number, together with his or her name, including previous names, date and place of birth, sex, address and nationality.</P>
      <P>A local authority will also be entitled to require certain listed bodies to give the authority information relating to the names, addresses, ages, nationalities and PPS numbers of persons resident within its area. The bodies listed include Departments, the OPW, local authorities, the Health Service Executive, statutory bodies and agencies, State-owned companies and financial institutions regulated by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority; the Private Residential Tenancies Board and any landlord who is obliged to register with the board under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004; and prescribed utility undertakings that supply energy, communications or broadcasting services to the public.</P>
      <P>It is stipulated that information given to a registration authority may be used in the performance of electoral registration duties and for no other purpose. A local authority may share the personal PPS number and public service identity of registered electors with the commissioner and with other registration authorities to prevent multiple registrations. The information may also be shared with presiding officers at polling stations at election time. However, local authorities may not publish a person&rsquo;s PPS number or public service identity in or in connection with a register of electors or share that information with any <Col N="94"/>other public body or any other person. The Bill provides also that documents relating to PPS numbers may be specified by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as documents that a returning officer or presiding officer may request a person applying for a ballot paper to produce. That system would ensure the PPS number is used, first, for the purposes of registering the voter in the first place and, second, as a control of possible voter fraud at the polling stage.</P>
      <P>In the longer term, the Labour Party believes we need to establish an independent electoral commission that will have full responsibility for all aspects of elections and referendums. However, the immediate priority that must be faced before the next general election is restoring regularity and accuracy to the electoral register. It is simply unthinkable that we could waltz into it with an electoral register that is up to 20% inaccurate, has great potential for electoral fraud, of which the Government has repeatedly been warned in this House and in the media, and about which it has taken no action.</P>
      <P>We have heard on many occasions, in exchanges I have had directly with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government during questions on the subject, and in others that my party colleagues have had with the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste on the Order of Business, a general sense of agreement from the Government side that there is a problem with the electoral register and that something will have to be done about it. However, we have seen no concrete steps taken by the Government to deal with the inaccuracy of it. We simply cannot have the next general election conducted with the register in its current shambolic state. I ask the Minister, when responding, to tell us what the Government will do about it, and if it intends to act. I appeal to him to accept the Labour Party Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, on producing the Electoral Registration Commissioner Bill 2005, which is long overdue. I also compliment my colleague, Deputy Quinn, who has raised this issue on several occasions in the House and made practical proposals on how we might have found a short-term solution to the problem by employing census enumerators to distribute ballot forms at the same time as they were delivering census forms. By registering people at the same time, we would be able to achieve an accurate count of those living in houses, apartments and flats across the country. I hope the Minister, as reported, will follow up and re-employ the census enumerators for the next few months after they have completed the collection of census forms to do what Deputy Quinn suggested might have been done at the same time more cheaply.</P><Col N="95"/>
      <P>I add for the Minister&rsquo;s interest that so far I have not received a census form, although I contacted the website and specifically asked for one before last Sunday. Perhaps census enumerators also require more supervision in certain areas.</P>
      <P>The inaccuracy of the electoral register is so great as to undermine the whole concept of one person, one vote and damage democracy considerably. As Deputy Gilmore said, with an estimated 400,000 to 800,000 persons registered to vote but not entitled to do so because the register has not been overhauled since the foundation of the State, the scope for abuse by unscrupulous persons is considerable, as are the difficulties in ensuring we have an accurate ballot at elections. It is incredible things should have reached this stage, given the importance we attach to the principle of one person, one vote, which is the bedrock of Irish democracy and sovereignty.</P>
      <P>This year we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising. In some commemorations we will remember that Cumann na mBan came out to join the Citizen Army and the Irish Volunteers because its members were committed to the concept of one person, one vote. They were suffragettes too, since it was part and parcel of the milieu of the time and inspired many people to become involved in the political movement. It is certainly of major concern to everyone in the country, and it should be of particular concern to us, who as politicians find we must face the people every few years. We expect each person to have one vote and no one to have more than one. We certainly do not expect anyone to have several or that the concept of voting early and often might still apply anywhere in the country.</P>
      <P>At least a dozen constituencies in the next election will return a D&aacute;il Deputy with a winning margin of a few hundred votes or less, which could turn the tide regarding what Government is formed. The country will be governed for five years or so on that basis, making it of considerable concern to us all. We are the only people with the power to do something about it. Deputy Gilmore proposes precisely that: a practical, rational system whereby we address the inflated register. That register is oversubscribed, probably in the vast majority of cases, for very valid reasons unconnected with any abuse. The dead have not been removed from the register because there is no mechanism to do so. Others may have moved on or have been registered twice, and the same applies. For all sorts of valid reasons, the register is growing all the time. Every time someone moves house, there is the danger that he or she will be registered again.</P>
      <P>I can explain the situation in a constituency such as mine. Dublin Central is an inner-city constituency, and the North Circular Road is largely populated by tenants in private landlord accommodation. There is an average of nine tenants to <Col N="96"/>each house on that street, and over the years vast numbers of them have come and gone. They have been added to the electoral register while they lived there, but their names have not been deleted upon leaving because there is no mechanism.</P>
      <P>At election time vast quantities of voting cards are distributed to those houses, and virtually anyone can pick them up and vote. Since no one knows the identity of such a transient population, no one challenges personation at the polling station. The system is now no longer so effective. Various political parties had personation agents in the stations, but that is no longer so widespread, and people are not challenging voters to the same degree, since they do not know their neighbours any more owing to great changes in the nature of urban populations in particular.</P>
      <P>There are of course numerous other means of abusing the voting system. In the absence of any supervisory and accountability mechanism, we have a real problem. Each local authority is charged with carrying out the work by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but no one checks to see what each local authority does.</P>
      <P>With scarce resources, maintaining the electoral register is time-consuming and expensive, and local authorities have more pressing needs. In the short term, census enumerators should continue to be employed in May and June to retrace their footsteps and check the electoral register. In the longer term, it is essential to put the compilation of the electoral register on a proper footing. An electoral registration commissioner is the best way of ensuring the register is put on such a proper footing and kept there.</P>
      <P>Gated communities are the bane of every politician, and virtually every new development now ends up being such. If one examines the register, one finds that only approximately 10% of people in such communities are registered to vote. That means they are outside the democratic process and we have vast increases in the populations of inner-city and suburban constituencies who are not part and parcel of the voting process. They cannot be contacted by politicians or even by census enumerators. This time, the latter group have found their job twice as hard as before.</P>
      <P>This is all part of the social change taking place. Much of it is due to the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has been very ineffective in dealing with the crime problems which have beset urban communities especially in recent times. People feel fearful unless they live in gated communities. Thankfully, Dublin City Council has made a policy decision that no more of its social housing developments will be gated communities. It had begun to go down the same road. I hope other local authorities will follow suit. Is there a system where we could ensure private developments for<Col N="97"/>ward some type of case before they can become gated communities which block out the world, all social intercourse and effectively mean people live in fortresses, because it is very damaging to society?</P>
      <P>The PPS number proposal for identification purposes is important. The present identification mechanisms are inadequate. The worst thing in the world is to have a system where a passport is regarded as the identification document because it is unreliable in the present circumstances. There must be closer supervision of the mechanism by which we deal with the matter. Supervision, co-ordination, monitoring and promotion of awareness are the keys to dealing with the problem. I hope the Minister will accept this legislation and deal with the matter in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, on bringing forward this Bill and Deputy Quinn who has spoken frequently on this important issue. As others said, people died for the right to vote, which we recently commemorated and which is fundamental to democracy. We must have two broad objectives. We must ensure nobody is deprived of their vote. That is a problem, especially in the new communities and building areas where it may be difficult, if not impossible, to register. The second objective must be to stop people who are willing to commit electoral fraud and personation to gain what potentially could be a hugely significant impact in terms of additional votes.</P>
      <P>Some candidates and parties so believe in their right to win, regardless of the rules, that they can have a field day if they are willing to abuse the chaos of the current electoral register. Landlords in many locations can pick up voting cards &mdash; in some cases by the dozen &mdash; and pass them on to candidates and parties willing to chance their arm and commit electoral fraud. If the Garda does not have much success apprehending people for murder and serious crimes of violence against the person, what are the chances of it seriously prosecuting people who decide to take a minimal risk and get involved in electoral fraud?</P>
      <P>The Minister should bear in mind what a team of ten people with hard necks and a willingness to personate could do. The polls are open for 13 hours on election day and most constituencies have been 20 and 50 polling stations. One would not need to be an armchair general to work out a schedule. A team of people could start at around 8.30 a.m., have tea and biscuits at lunchtime and continue to personate until the evening. They could perhaps go to the count centre the next day to look at the count results. They could carry out hundreds of voting personations. If they were in any way ingenious about it, were prepared to use the odd headscarf, wig or change of jacket and move around in a disciplined quasi-<Col N="98"/>military way, God knows what they would be able to do in terms of votes in sensitive constituencies.</P>
      <P>I was particularly struck by what a number of Deputies from the Minister&rsquo;s party said. After the previous general election, they told me how surprised they were to find a massive surge in voting by people they did not know from Adam late in the day at large polling stations in the Dublin area. Deputy Costello spoke about Dublin Central. The extraordinary surge in voting late in the day in certain polling stations in parts of Dublin Central was mentioned to me.</P>
      <P>Let us be realistic about the challenge. Some challenges to democracy come in a particular format and involve direct undermining of, and making physical threats against, the State. However, making a threat by way of voter fraud could have as dramatic an impact on the future of Government and representation in this country. Although the Government has tut-tutted in recent times about this, I am not sure it has taken the issue seriously enough.</P>
      <P>There are a number of issues in respect of Dublin West. There are thousands of new houses and many new communities, including people coming to live there from elsewhere in the country and from all over the world. There are groups of residents who are new to the area. Housing estates of 1,500 to 2,500 houses built over a three or four-year period are not untypical in Dublin West.</P>
      <P>The political sc&eacute;al and folktale was that in the wintertime, Fianna F&aacute;il branches, in particular in constituencies such as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, sat in the local pub, pored over the register and had a bit of an argument about whether somebody was really living at home or whether they had gone to college or were working in England and America. Removing a name from, or adding one to, the register was hard fought between political parties. It was one of the functions of rural branches of political parties, and it probably still is.</P>
      <P>However, what does one do in a constituency such as Dublin West with 2,500 houses in an estate? People are lucky enough to know the neighbour on either side of them. I do not know of the political party which has the intelligence to be able to sit in judgment on who is really living in the 2,500 houses in an estate. I see the Minister pointing opposite. That is quite scary.</P>
      <P>There is also a phenomenon where in constituencies such as Dublin West, 15% to 25% of houses in some areas are rented. For the most part, the landlords stay on the register. Where should a landlord be registered? Is it where the landlord lives or the property which he or she may own but may have left to move down to Wicklow to be closer to the Minister, for example? Where are these people meant to be registered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly. We have a series of problems which present extraordinary difficulty.</P>
      <P>As most of us know, there are genuinely distressed citizens in the community who seek to exercise their vote and who try to get on the register in the immediate run-up to the election. It is unbelievably difficult, and there are pink and blue forms. A person must use one type of form if they are in a certain category. County council officials do not even know how to categorise people. Could we have voter registration and information booths in supermarkets and big shopping centres in order for people to get information in a friendly, informative and authoritative way? Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s idea that the PPS number be used as an integral part of identification and registration of people is a must with regard to cutting down the capacity for fraud.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and he will take five minutes.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate in the House tonight the important issue of the electoral register. As the House is aware, entry on the register is key to giving reality to the individual&rsquo;s right and responsibility to participate in the democratic system.</P>
      <P>There are a number of problems with the Labour Party Bill, although it has good intentions. We all recognise that the accuracy of the electoral register needs to be improved. This Bill, despite the good intentions behind it, will not achieve that. The Bill effectively proposes the creation of a new quango to take on the task of supervising how local authorities do their work in this area. It does not offer practical solutions to improving the register in the short term.</P>
      <P>Section 6(1)(<i>b</i>) sets out the task of the commission, which is &ldquo;to carry out on behalf of registration authorities such of their registration duties as the Commissioner agrees or decides.&rdquo; This happens without any stated basis, due process or consultation, and a local authority can lose its registration functions. In section 6(3), the commissioner has the power to do all that is necessary to perform his or her functions under the Bill. This would create an all-powerful quango. What about all the talk we hear of accountability through Ministers to the D&aacute;il?</P>
      <P>There is reference in sections 18 and 19 to the commissioner intervening in the day-to-day work of registration authorities and issuing directions to them. However, the reader is given no indication as to what the directions might cover and no test of reasonableness is required to be met. In this House the Opposition parties have complained, not unreasonably, about the creation of <Col N="100"/>too many quangos, and that this has removed matters from D&aacute;il scrutiny, yet this Bill intends to do just that.</P>
      <P>Section 20, relating to PPS numbers, interests me. It should be considered in the context of the reality that information held within the social welfare system will not readily match with people on the register because of the lack of individual identifiers. A complete national canvas for numbers would be needed, with no guarantee that people will co-operate. Even if they did, it would be a massive task that could not be addressed between now and 1 November next.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore would not intend that it would be an offence to refuse to give your PPS number at the door or that people would not be allowed on the register if they did not co-operate. To say, as in section 20(1), that people shall comply with such a requirement begs many questions. What about the powers in section 20(1)(<i>b</i>) for local authorities to compile a huge database of personal information? Section 23 seems to introduce into Irish law the concept of compulsory electoral registration, something that I would have thought merits fuller debate and consideration.</P>
      <P>I could go on but it is clear that these unplanned and poorly thought out proposals are unworkable. I say this without in any way intending to diminish the sincerity of Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s concerns. I have no doubt that setting out on the diversions created by this Bill would result in chaos in the electoral registration process and damage to the democratic system. The problem with the Bill is that while Deputy Gilmore is correct about problems existing with the register, this legislation would not effect a change if enacted in the short term. It would not effect an improvement between now and November, when the new draft register is due to be published. It would not resolve anything by June 2007 and could well be open to legal challenge given the confusion that surrounds it. No responsible Government could support the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is generally acknowledged that the task of compiling the register has become more difficult over the years. This is because of reasons suggested by Opposition Deputies, such as rapid population growth and physical development, increased personal mobility and growing numbers of gated apartment complexes. I share the aversion of the Deputies to those. Other reasons include greater access to third level education, increased rates of new household formation and other changes. There is also a general busyness in modern society. All these make compilation of the register more difficult, but they do not excuse the point being made by a number of Deputies that there has been a degree of indolence which is unforgivable in some local authority areas.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge, as I did on previous occasions in this House and elsewhere, that the quality of the register is not satisfactory. In 2002 there was <Col N="101"/>a difference between the number of people on the register who were eligible to vote at elections and the relevant census data for that year of up to 300,000. I previously pointed out that this does not take into account people who should have been on the register but were not. The actual number is higher, and we could dispute the figure, but it is nonetheless a figure in which none of us can take pleasure.</P>
      <P>Problems with voting registers are not unique to Ireland. It might be useful to quote from a study of electoral system design published in 2005 by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. The following is from paragraph 213:</P>
      <P LI="1">Voter registration is the most complex and controversial, and often least successful, part of electoral administration. By its nature it involves collecting in a standardised format specific information from a vast number of voters, and then arranging and distributing these data in a form that can be used at election time &mdash; moreover, in such a way as to ensure that only eligible electors engage in the voting process and to guard against multiple voting, personation and the like.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Deputies should excuse me for the long sentence but I am not the author. It continues:</P>
      <P LI="1">The political sensitivity of these matters and the laborious nature of the task itself mean that voter registration is often one of the most expensive and time-consuming parts of the entire electoral process.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This shows clearly the difficult issues involved in electoral registration and the fact that concerns in this area are not unique to Ireland.</P>
      <P>I wish to set out my own and the Government&rsquo;s approach to the electoral register. We are determined to see action taken to secure a significant improvement in the quality of the register with local authorities to make a concerted effort to improve the register for their areas. The core elements of this include the provision of updated and consolidated guidance so that all local authorities work to the same template. Amazingly, when we discussed this late last year and I researched the matter, it appears that the authorities did not all work to the same template. Another element of this action is the potential use of census enumerators, and others, to assist local authorities in preparing the next register, as part of an intensive registration campaign. I stated that it was not possible or practical to run the register and the census update together.</P>
      <P>Other elements of the action include new arrangements to delete deceased persons from the register and the provision of additional financial resources for local authorities to support intensified action on the register. Funding, as mentioned by Deputy Gilmore, is not an excuse <Col N="102"/>for local authority indolence. There is something perverse about the fact that the voting register is worse than it was when local authorities did not have resources. The last element of the action is an intensive information campaign.</P>
      <P>There should be an early start to the register campaign for 2007 and 2008 with the issuing of the relevant form shortly from my Department. I will encourage local authorities to make maximum use of relevant databases available to them to cross-check accuracy and comprehensiveness. I will illustrate this with a reference. We are all aware of cases where new local authority estates have been opened and people do not appear on the register. That cannot be excused and local authorities should not try to do so. It has nothing to do with resources and is caused by indolence. It is inexcusable when local authorities put people on a housing list into an estate without transferring them from the old register to a new one. I will return to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not have the resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under long-standing electoral law in this country, the compilation and publication of the register is a matter for the relevant city or county council. It is the duty of local authorities in law to ensure, as far as possible, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register. This is not a slight function for the local authorities, but a central function. In carrying out this work, local authorities depend to a significant degree on the co-operation of the general public, who have the right to expect significant support and guidance from local authorities.</P>
      <P>Electoral reform has addressed issues related to the register in recent years. Enhanced legislative provisions affecting the register, as sought by many Members of the House, have been introduced such as the creation of and increased access to the supplementary register, which should facilitate adding people to the register, and the computerisation and on-line access for individuals to the register, a matter to which I shall return. Other important areas addressed as part of the electoral reform agenda have included consolidation of electoral law in the 1990s, the introduction of controls on election spending and donations from 1994 onwards, which is not affected by this Bill, and advancing change to the voting system itself from the late 1990s.</P>
      <P>The challenge today is to tackle the problems with the register in the ways best suited to the circumstances that exist today. The draft register for 2007-08, on which the next general election will be held, must be published on 1 November 2006, with the final version available shortly afterwards. This gives a very narrow window of opportunity for action by local authorities and makes it impracticable to implement radical alternative <Col N="103"/>legislative arrangements in the time available, even if such were desirable. Results are more likely to be achieved by working within the current organisational framework based on the local authorities as the responsible bodies, and by facilitating the local authorities in doing their work and encouraging them to do their work better than heretofore. No matter how much they might protest otherwise, the Deputies opposite cannot escape that reality.</P>
      <P>I have taken a range of actions in the past year to address issues of concern regarding the register. Local authorities were requested by circular from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in July 2005 to take all necessary steps to secure significant improvement in the quality of the register. This action was complemented by the Department&rsquo;s best practice guidance for local authorities to assist them in preparing the register. Amazingly the standard of operation between local authorities had considerable variation. The guidance was sent to local authorities, returning officers and the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government last November for comment prior to finalisation. In view of the importance of the matter, local authorities have been told to implement the guidance immediately. Any local authority not applying the guidance has no excuse but to get on with the job.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Among the specific features of the guidance are a full account of the complex law in this area, a more user friendly format, a timetable of the key activities and milestones in preparing the register along with the relevant legislative references, more detailed guidance on the format and structure of the register with samples of the different page formats, instruction on the definition of ordinary residence in particular for categories such as students, the Traveller community, emigrants, residents with holiday homes etc., which is aimed at avoiding under-registration or multiple registration &mdash; a point mentioned by Deputy Burton &mdash; emphasis on the prohibition on people being registered as electors at more than one address, with local authorities encouraged to cross-check and co-ordinate with other authorities to ensure electors are not registered more than once, detailed information on the categories of voters eligible to register as postal or special voters and the procedures to be followed in this regard, extensive guidance on operational and organisational matters in compiling information, periodic reviews of overall procedures are called for to ensure that high standards of accuracy and comprehensiveness are achieved, and details of a range of procedures for checking the draft register, including scrutiny by the Garda, cross-checking by field staff, checking omission of names on the previous register, public display of the register, the role of public <Col N="104"/>representatives, and local and national awareness campaigns. As public representatives we all have a responsibility to interest ourselves in this issue. Deputy Burton is right in pointing out that the growing urbanisation makes it more difficult, which simply means we must try harder.</P>
      <P>Emphasis on the application of information technology resources to facilitate voters to check on-line whether they are registered correctly, and to enable them to download registration and claim forms from the local authority&rsquo;s website, also forms part of the guidance that has been circulated. It is inexcusable that some local authorities do not have these systems fully operational. Each local authority is required to appoint a designated officer to take personal responsibility for the work involved in the register.</P>
      <P>A second volume accompanies the guidance, which includes sample layouts for the register, copies of all the application and claim forms relating to the register and samples of advertising notices and posters used in previous draft register publicity campaigns. I have taken the trouble to outline all this detail, as it is clear from tonight&rsquo;s contributions that some local authorities take this very important democratic function seriously and some do not. It is inexcusable for such a difference to exist.</P>
      <P>This guidance, in two extensive documents, is a real and practical contribution to improving the quality of the register. The Department is now finalising the guidance in light of the comments received in the consultation process. In the final version, I will specifically highlight the importance of local authorities crosschecking the register with other databases available to them. Local authorities have many databases, for example their housing database. It is inexcusable for a local authority not to even have its own local authority houses properly registered.</P>
      <P>In a previous debate, I mentioned the problem of the registration of deaths. More than 30,000 deaths are recorded in Ireland each year. Under a further recent initiative, local authorities now have regular access to electronic files linked with the General Register Office, which contain information on deaths in their areas. This allows for the efficient and timely deletion of the names of deceased persons from the electoral register. This process replaces cumbersome and time-consuming procedures to secure information on deaths. We all know how difficult it is to co-ordinate death information. Real-time access to the electronic file should allow local authorities to deal with 30,000 registrations per year.</P>
      <P>By giving local authorities access on a regular basis to this information in a usable way, this initiative makes a real contribution to improving the accuracy of the electoral register. It will also help to address the difficulties families have when material, sent innocently by political parties <Col N="105"/>through the post, and ultimately a voting card are addressed to somebody who has passed away two or three years previously. The Department has advised local authorities to make full use of these data to ensure the names of deceased persons are deleted from the register in an efficient and timely manner. Deputies could be helpful in checking to see if appropriate changes are made to the register.</P>
      <P>Local authorities utilise a number of different approaches in compiling the register, and I will be emphasising the need to ensure adequate staffing resources are devoted to the task. I am urgently considering the available options, including the possibility that local authorities could engage experienced census enumerators to complement their own local sources on the basis of temporary employment. For a range of practical reasons it was not possible to conduct both the census and the electoral register editing in the same way. They are separate and important functions, both of which require separate treatment.</P>
      <P>On resources for the register work, in 2006 I have allocated general-purpose grants to local authorities totalling &euro;875 million, an increase of &euro;57 million, or 7%, over the 2005 allocation. I do not accept that lack of funding is an excuse for poor electoral work by local authorities. How can a local authority legitimately claim such an excuse when we know they are being funded at a higher rate than ever before? What logic supports the hypothesis that the more funds local authorities have the less accurate is the register? I am prepared to provide additional funding for local authorities during the year to ensure a comprehensive once-off check is effectively undertaken, which as Deputy Costello said in his contribution, has never previously been done. I will make sure local authorities use this funding in a genuinely additional way. I will not tolerate &mdash; as I discovered recently in the non-national roads allocation &mdash; managers skimming money from local contributions meaning that as money from central Government is increased the contribution from local government reduces: that will not happen. I will not allow them to reduce their overall funding by diluting their own contributions.</P>
      <P>Citizens also have obligations. The law places the obligation on the local authority to compile the register. However, it is also important that individual citizens play their full part in ensuring they are entered correctly on the electoral register. Registration requirements are not onerous. The establishment of a supplementary register gives those who need to register late in the day the opportunity to do so. A national awareness campaign and related local campaigns associated with preparation of the electoral register were undertaken last November in support of the process of registration and encouraging citizens to register. I intend to intensify those campaigns <Col N="106"/>later this year because it is important that we take action in this regard before 1 November next.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The use of the Internet could be a tremendous facility for many people, especially younger people, in this regard. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has asked all local authorities to ensure that registration information, including current registration forms, is prominent on their websites. An on-line register search facility, which is easy to access and use, is available for people to check whether they are on the register. When I checked the local authority websites today to see whether the facility works, I found that it works on some websites but not on others. My officials have ensured that the relevant local authorities have been informed that their systems are down. If Deputies check the websites of their local authorities and find there are problems, I would be grateful to hear from them and to pursue such problems with individual authorities. I have mentioned some practical ways in which we can address this issue, such as making clear to local authorities what is expected of them, giving them detailed guidance, engaging in consultation on that guidance, using other databases, maximising the use of information technology, providing short-term staffing and funding and promoting awareness.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>I would like to speak about an issue that was raised by Deputy Costello. The voting process is validated or otherwise on voting day. A number of Deputies have mentioned that the process of challenging voters when they present themselves is less common than it used to be. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002 contains more stringent requirements in respect of the use of the electoral register. The Department&rsquo;s guidelines now require at least 25% of voters to be challenged to produce identity documentation. Local authorities and electoral officials are responsible for ensuring that this is done. Polling staff and personating agents are not simply passengers who sit there all day on election day &mdash; they have jobs to do too. I have highlighted a set of practical and focused proposals which will help to overcome the difficulties we have in this regard in a timely manner, certainly before 1 November next.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, for sharing time with me. I welcome this debate. The Members on this side of the House take a different approach to Deputy Gilmore on this matter. I welcome the fact that he has allowed us to debate this issue.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, Deputy Gilmore and his colleagues proposed, on foot of a debate on Question Time in this House, that census enu<Col N="107"/>merators should be allowed to check the electoral register. As the Minister of State with responsibility for the Central Statistics Office, I pursued that proposal. The Minister, Deputy Roche, has informed the House that it was simply not possible to take further steps in that regard. I am sure we all agree that census enumerators have a difficult job in concentrating on their valuable and focused work, which they have almost completed. Not only do they have to ensure that people sign their census forms, they also have to do the follow-up work. This is a separate issue that needs to be addressed. I will refer briefly to the role of the Central Statistics Office in this respect later in my speech.</P>
      <P>I think we all agree that voting is the oxygen of democratic politics. There is substantial interest in this subject across party lines. I hope we can agree a way forward on foot of this debate. There are some short-term requirements in this regard. My colleague, Deputy Roche, has clearly outlined many of the obvious solutions that can be put in place. We need to find concrete and well thought out solutions to the decline in voter registration and participation, which is a matter that must be treated seriously. The Minister has mentioned some such solutions. A radical overhaul of the system is impractical in the relatively short time that remains in the lifetime of this Government. I accept that the issue of electoral registration will have to be dealt with comprehensively in the longer term. I do not doubt that this debate will inform us all in that regard. Nobody has a monopoly on solutions. Everybody has practical experience of this issue, which is closely related to the work we all do.</P>
      <P>Some blatantly obvious short-term issues need to be addressed urgently. Local authorities should redouble their efforts. We should consider further practical and realistic proposals, within the existing legislative framework, to assist registration authorities in ensuring that the electoral register is as comprehensive and as accurate as possible. We all accept there are huge problems in that regard. As the Minister of State with responsibility for the Central Statistics Office, I have opened discussions with the CSO about the possibility of census enumerators helping to carry out the vital role of ensuring that the register is maintained and updated on a consistent and continual basis. The personnel in question are well placed to provide a service to the voter and potential voter in this regard. I do not ignore or undervalue the vital role played by the local authorities in this area. I do not intend to rule them out of the process entirely.</P>
      <P>Local government has changed dramatically in recent years. It faces huge challenges in a range of areas, not least in maintaining and updating the register of electors. As the Minister of State responsible for e-Government, as part of any <Col N="108"/>long-term overhaul of the system, future Governments might actively explore the idea of on-line voter registration which offers the possibility of a speedy and efficient electronic method of voter registration. Such a measure, like the proposals in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill before us, would require significant input from all the stakeholders. Extensive testing and analysis of the various security and confidentiality protocols, not to mention the identity protocols which might be required if such a system proved desirable, would have to be undertaken. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reference to the need for on-line checking of the register. It is important that people should avail of that facility.</P>
      <P>The task at hand is immediate and simple &mdash; to ensure by next year that the electoral registers for all constituencies are up to date and accurate and that everyone legally entitled to vote in the next general election can and will be able to do so. Conversely, individuals who are not entitled to have a vote should not be allowed to remain on or be added to the register. This House should agree on the need for a major drive by the local authorities over the next six months to ensure that a reliable and accurate electoral register is established.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Gilmore has made some important proposals, they are matters, like on-line registration, which need to be considered over the longer term. Given that the House needs to address some real and immediate needs, I respectfully suggest that it should pursue the approach adopted by the Minister, Deputy Roche. If extra personnel are required on a short-term basis, and I do not doubt that they are, they should be taken on. It does not matter whether they come from the Central Statistics Office. I know the Minister has some other ideas on where they might come from. If people are available to perform this major logistical task, they should be asked to do it. There should not be any barriers to the organisation of a straightforward logistical operation that will enhance our democratic system. A major national awareness campaign will be required to ensure that the next register is properly compiled.</P>
      <P>I urge the House to agree that practical and necessary steps are needed if we are to deal with this matter. I welcome the fact that this issue has been raised. I have spoken about this matter because the Central Statistics Office, for which I am responsible, comes under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. I have been in touch with the CSO about the census, as requested by the Deputies opposite. That could not be done, unfortunately, but I genuinely feel that the staff of the CSO are ready, willing and able to assist in this regard. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities have ultimate responsibility in this regard. We should work <Col N="109"/>together on this issue. I do not think the House should divide on a matter of this importance. I hope the Members opposite will agree that the Government has proposed some practical solutions in a serious manner as part of this important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share time with Deputy McGinley, with the agreement of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know where to start after what I have heard. I welcome the final comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who said there is not much difference between the intentions of the Government and the Opposition in respect of this matter. I was disappointed with the negative initial response of the Minister, Deputy Roche, to this Bill, although what is new about that?</P>
      <P>He said no responsible Government could support this Bill. I am not sure whether the Minister is attributing that status to the current Government which cannot be put in that category. However, he clearly laid it on the line that if he thinks this is a responsible Government, it is not supporting the Bill. That was a negative response to a genuine attempt to solve this problem.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for bringing this excellent Bill forward. We fully support it on this side of the House and will not be negative about it in any way. Something like this legislation has to be introduced because the state of the electoral register is an absolute disgrace. It is time this issue was debated as the nation prepares to hand back its census forms. It was timely, too, that the Government at the weekend alerted the media that census enumerators may be charged with updating the register. It is typical of the Government to magically come up with a proposal that seeks to outflank the Opposition a few days before this Private Members&rsquo; Bill was introduced in the House.</P>
      <P>The last time my party, for example, was due to debate the nitrates Bill, on a Tuesday, the Government introduced its proposals on the preceding Friday. Its proposals on what to do about property management companies miraculously appeared a few days before we produced a reasoned Private Members&rsquo; Bill on apartment complexes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We are ahead of the Opposition all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>We are honoured and somewhat chuffed that the Government is watching the Opposition and taking heed of what it is bringing forward. It is good that it is waking up <Col N="110"/>in that regard. It seems the Government is finally waking up to the serious problem we have with the electoral register, which is also welcome. Instead of being negative we very much welcome the Government&rsquo;s new found interest in all those matters.</P>
      <P>In June last year the Minister told the House there were 300,000 more names on the electoral register than were eligible to vote, mainly due to slowness in revising the register. I believe that figure could have doubled since. This is due mainly to the slowness in removing the names of dead people, the increase in the number of second homes and persons moving about without advising local authorities. I know of nobody who advises the local authority when he or she moves around. This is especially true in large housing estates in urban areas where there are many rented properties and tenants move in and out on a regular basis. The register is completely and absolutely out of date, as many Deputies have said. Given that nothing has been done since, one can only imagine how much worse the position is now.</P>
      <P>My party colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, in December 2004 called for an explanation from South Dublin County Council as to why many people were removed from the electoral register in the run-up to the local elections there. Since the close of the poll Senator Brian Hayes has been contacted by a number of people in Dublin South-West who were unable to vote because they had been removed from the register of electors. It is a sinister development where law abiding citizens who try to exercise their right to vote were denied because some mysterious person had deleted them from the register. As the responsibility for compiling the register rests with the relevant local authorities, questions must be asked as to why and how this occurred. It has occurred in many other areas as well. No matter what the Minister says about the volume of personnel and resources available, local authorities are stretched as regards doing their own work without this extra burden being put on them. I hope the Minister is genuine in his assertion that he is providing money. He should ring-fence some money for local authorities to deal with the electoral register.</P>
      <P>Before someone is removed from the register there should be a clear paper trail from the individual to the local authority. At that time Senator Brian Hayes called on the Dublin local authority to explain to voters who were taken off the register exactly who was responsible and why they were removed before the local elections. Equally, the law should be reformed to allow only voters to remove their names from the register. After it is published in April, it could be standard practice to send out a small card to everybody indicating they are on the electoral register. People in households would know they were not on the <Col N="111"/>register if they did not receive a card and there should be a possibility of having the matter corrected at once rather than waiting for 21 to 14 days from a general election. The supplementary register provision is very welcome, but it should be activated much earlier.</P>
      <P>It is clear the compilation of the register is haphazard and patchy. Little effort is made to get an accurate picture of exactly who is entitled to vote in the months before an election. Another key problem is the nature of many new apartment developments. Everyone knows it is simply not possible to gain entry to most apartments, never mind who lives there. This is not necessarily a bad situation. It offers a great degree of security to residents, but it makes matters very difficult for someone trying to compile an accurate register. Something must be done to ensure those people are put on the register.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, recently came across an apartment complex in his constituency where no one had voted in the last election as people had moved on and the register was out of date. It is difficult enough to get young people to vote. They are busy, work long hours and are part of a generation that feels separated from the political process, let down by it in many cases and sees no point in voting. There is a difficult task in getting those people to vote, quite apart from getting them to register. We should not make it harder to convince them to take part in the democratic process than it is already. There is no need for those massive inaccuracies. This is 2006, other countries have had widescale apartment living for generations and they can get their citizens onto the electoral register without a problem.</P>
      <P>I should be interested to learn the level of registration among new workers here. EU citizens are entitled to vote in local and European elections, while non-EU citizens can vote in local elections, but only if they are registered. Figures from the North are not promising as there is no reason to believe they are any better than here. Only four out of ten people in the minority communities in the North are registered to vote, compared to more than nine out of ten in the general population. That figure compares unfavourably with England and Wales where an estimated 3% of minority ethnic communities are registered. Moreover, out of the minority groupings registered in the North, fewer than half bother to vote compared to the overall average turnout there of 64%. Among minorities in the North, almost a third said they did not know how to register and a quarter said they did not know they had to register. I urge the Minister to examine this area when he takes on the challenge of sorting out the register.</P>
      <P>Every person has a PPS number. This is vital, as indicated by Deputy Gilmore and other Labour Party speakers. When someone reaches <Col N="112"/>voting age they get a PPS number. The Department of Social and Family Affairs could automatically inform the relevant local authority. Such a system would effectively eliminate much of the confusion that currently reigns. The Minister said there were complications involved in this as well, but I cannot see how this could be so.</P>
      <P>I echo the comments of my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, as regards voting rights for prisoners. Many people in prison have few skills. Some have little formal education. These people are deprived of their liberty and to deprive them of the right to vote as well is to dehumanise them. It also releases prisoners from their responsibilities. In times gone by it was difficult if not impossible to have prisoners on the electoral register and allow them to vote, but times have changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that is a good idea, and legislation is coming forward in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and appreciate such an initiative is being contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is already recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Checks and balances must be introduced if prisoners are given votes, and I am sure the Minister will do that.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to refer to the debacle of electronic voting, during the course of this debate. That episode has put the entire political electoral process in a very bad light. Taxpayers are paying exorbitant rates for the storage of useless electronic voting machines, thanks to the complete lack of direction from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. These machines were bought and never used, despite the trenchant opposition of Deputy Gilmore and myself over many days at the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government. The former Minister, Deputy Cullen, insisted on having his own way and got the Government majority on the committee at the time to agree to purchase those machines, despite the doubts and lack of clarity surrounding the issue. The revelation on foot of a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Paul McGrath showed the State is paying widely differing annual rates for still storing those useless machines. The costs range from nothing in County Sligo to an average of &euro;1.65 per machine in County Louth and an incredible &euro;271.22 per machine in County Waterford &mdash; the home county of the Minister who was responsible for buying those machines. The overall cost for the storage of voting machines in County Waterford is close to &euro;50,000 a year. It is well for the warehouse owner who is getting that rent courtesy of the useless machines he is storing. Will the Mini<Col N="113"/>ster, Deputy Roche, come clean and say when he will have a sale of those machines or will he make a clean breast of it and admit they are useless and that their purchase was a mistake and stop storing them? Will the Minister who was responsible for the purchase of the machines be surcharged for the loss that will be incurred when those machines are sold?</P>
      <P>Another serious fault with the register is the short window of opportunity provided for examining the register. The Minister referred to this matter in his speech. When the register comes out at the end of November one will have only up to 28 December or some such date to check it. That is not a good time of the year as people have enough on their minds coming up to Christmas with all the rush and the hype involved without having to check the electoral register. I made a submission on this matter to the commission that was considering changes to the legislation, but it was ignored.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister refer to this issue because if a proper window of opportunity were provided, such as when party branch meetings take place from January to March each year, as the Minister suggested, political parties and local and national representatives could play a part in ensuring the register was compiled fairly accurately. This could be done efficiently and effectively in rural areas where practically everybody knows everybody else, although that situation is now changing. There is very little opportunity of doing this in urban areas where one only knows one&rsquo;s next door neighbour or a few people down the street, except in very settled estates where one&rsquo;s children have grown up and one mixes with other people. It is practically impossible to know who is living in new estates and to compile the register in an effective and correct manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the registration of deaths. Over 30,000 deaths are recorded in Ireland each year. When canvassing one often asks how many votes are in each house and the person who opens the door would say there is this person, that person and so on. A canvasser could read down the register and say there is John Roche, Michael Roche, Mary Roche and Patrick Roche, only to be told that the woman&rsquo;s husband, Patrick, died four years ago, although he is still on the register. That is embarrassing for both the woman in the house and the canvasser and it should not happen. The register of deaths could be used to ensure that at least deceased people are taken off the electoral register.</P>

	<P>I hope that is the case because when my political interest was first awakened by my father talking about what went on during elections in his time when impersonation agents were in polling stations I often heard him say that the Fianna F&aacute;il slogan was &ldquo;Vote early and vote often.&rdquo; I hope that is no longer the case.

Caithfear rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh mar gheall ar chl&aacute;r na v&oacute;t&oacute;ir&iacute;.

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That is due to the holiday homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is one of the reasons for these duplications. I had a brief discussion with a <Col N="115"/>census enumerator recently who told me that out of 120 houses in one small area in my parish, 54 were holiday homes. I do not think a person who happens to have a holiday home is entitled to be on the electoral register. That is an issue that must be examined, especially in rural areas. It is in part due to the Celtic tiger that people have homes all over the place. If a person is living in Dublin, he or she is not entitled to vote in Donegal, Galway or anywhere else because he or she has a holiday home there. Likewise, if one is living in Northern Ireland one is not supposed to vote in Donegal because one has a holiday home there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the guidance sent to local authorities that one is not entitled to vote in an area where one owns a holiday home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that message is sent to local authorities and that it is implemented.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy McCormack, referred to people who have passed away. We all have experience of going to houses where some member of the family has passed away. When a person dies I take it that the death is registered somewhere along the line and that there is a central register. Leaving aside the machines purchased by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, which I would not trust, there must be a computer somewhere in the country that would transfer the information that a person has passed away, that he or she should be deleted forthwith and that it should not be left up to anyone else to do it. Another reason for duplication occurs in Gaeltacht areas where a person&rsquo;s name is recorded both in Irish and English.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the supplementary register. It was introduced for a good reason some years ago but I believe it could turn into a trojan horse. We must be careful about who is entitled to apply for a supplementary vote. A window of opportunity is presented between the publication of the draft register and the revised version, and strict regulations and conditions should apply to anyone who applies for a vote at that stage. We should go as far as introducing sworn affidavits. The local garda&iacute; should have a role to play in this regard. When the supplementary register was introduced there were probably as many people on it in some counties as on the draft register. It provides an opportunity for unfair political advantage by unscrupulous persons.</P>

      <sTitle>National Treatment Purchase Fund.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to procedures which have been available on the National Treatment Purchase Fund. The patient was to have this treatment carried out under the fund but the procedure has been cancelled for some reason. I have had a number of complaints from different people in cases where the National Treatment Purchase Fund has not fulfilled its obligations as laid down by Government. The Government seems to be shamefully manipulating public opinion and is preying on the fears and vulnerability of patients. The National Treatment Purchase Fund is not doing its job. It is like the rest of the health service and is adding to the concerns and fears of patients. They are suffering because of the way the Government is managing the health service.</P>
        <P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund was intended to focus on patients waiting the longest for procedures, but it has failed to fulfil that commitment in the case of the patient to whom this matter refers. I have chosen this specific case to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response. The National Treatment Purchase Fund has failed in its obligations on a number of occasions. It has promised to do this procedure for this patient and others but has not done so. It has stated that it will no longer carry out this procedure.</P>
        <P>The 30,000 people who have had procedures carried out under the National Treatment Purchase Fund are the fortunate ones in some respects. However the treatment they have received is exactly the same as that received by the 4 million patients in acute hospitals over the same period. The Government seems to be using the National Treatment Purchase Fund as some form of public relations machine to make themselves look good.</P>
        <P>The focus of the National Treatment Purchase Fund should be changed. It is supposed to focus on procedures that prove difficult to be carried out within the health service. The fund should focus on procedures involving more complex sur<Col N="117"/>gery or on procedures not commonly carried out in this country, but this is not the case. The NTPF focuses on procedures such as gall bladder, varicose veins and skin biopsies. These are very simple procedures. Reform of the health care services has been promised every year for the past nine years and these procedures should be carried out in the acute hospitals.</P>
        <P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund should be used for neurological procedures and neurological surgery. The case to which I refer is a neurological procedure that may lead to surgery at some future date for this patient. This is the way forward for the NTPF. We are all aware of the long delays within the neurological services and the significant delays for neurological procedures. This is an opportunity for the Government to show me and the House what it intends to do for my patient who needs this specific procedure and to give an indication of where its commitment lies.</P>
        <P>I hope that the Minister of State&rsquo;s response will not consist of the usual bluff stating the matter is being looked at and giving a lame excuse for the reason this procedure is not being carried out for my patient. I will pursue the matter further if the answer is inadequate.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Twomey for raising this matter on the Adjournment of the House. I am replying on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services rests with the Health Service Executive. This includes responsibility for the provision of pain management clinics. The provision of spinal simulator devices for pain control are provided publicly at a number of hospitals, including St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Elm Park, Beaumont Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital. Demand for this service has risen dramatically in the past 12 to 18 months.</P>
        <P>The primary role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund is to arrange treatment for public patients who have been waiting longest for surgery. To date the NTPF has arranged treatment for 40,000 patients. This is not just a cosmetic exercise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is now the case that, in most instances, anyone waiting more than three months will be facilitated by the fund.</P>
        <P>In 2005 the NTPF set up a number of out-patient pilot projects throughout the country. The intention was that those waiting the longest in a number of specialties would receive consultations at out-patient level in private hospitals. More than 4,400 patients had out-patient appointments arranged for them. An additional 3,100 patients were removed from out-patient waiting lists as part of the validation process.</P>
        <P>The NTPF has advised that procedures to insert spinal cord stimulators have not been cancelled. The fund has informed the Department that treatment will proceed for patients who have been scheduled. However, I understand that the NTPF will engage in discussions with the Health Service Executive to ensure that the needs of patients who require spinal cord stimulator insertion are prioritised and met.</P>

      <sTitle>Job Losses.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry"><NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
	<P>In the not too distant past, north Tipperary was home to some of the world&rsquo;s largest industrial companies such as Aventis Pharma, Antigen, Procter and Gamble, Tubex, BSN Medical and large Irish-owned companies such as Irish Sugar.</P>
        <P>In the past two weeks a shattering and demoralising blow has been inflicted on the people of Thurles. BSN Medical, which had employed more than 120 people in Thurles before Christmas, announced that it would close by the end of this year with the loss of the remaining 80 jobs. Erin Foods, owned by Campbells, was also put on the market recently. It is hoped that this world renowned brand can be sold as a going <Col N="119"/>concern. However, the intention to sell the company has cast doubt and uncertainty on the future of the plant. Greenvale Animal Feeds, a subsidiary of Irish Sugar, employs more than 60 people in Thurles and now with the closure of Irish Sugar, these jobs are also in doubt.</P>
        <P>BSN Medical is a global medical device company and was created as a 50:50 joint venture between Beiersdorf and Smith &amp; Nephew in April 2001. BSN Medical specialises in bandaging and wound care, especially for burn victims. Another US company, Jobst, was the previous owner of the BSN Thurles operation until it was taken over in 1990. The manufacture of medical bandages has been carried out in Thurles for many years and many of the staff at the plant have spent their entire working lives in this factory and have been a very loyal and dedicated workforce. The news that the entire operation will cease by the end of the year is dreadful news for the staff, their families, the town and the economy of Thurles.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister of State to ensure that the US management of BSN Medical offers the current staff facing redundancy the same terms and conditions as their colleagues who opted for voluntary redundancy before Christmas and that every support and resource of the State is made available to these 80 people to assist them in seeking new employment.</P>
        <P>It is an outrage that almost all of the companies I have mentioned closed in the past seven years under this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government. Ineffective Government policy has forced hundreds of workers across north Tipperary to search for alternative employment or the nearest dole office.</P>
        <P>North Tipperary has not benefited in any way from foreign direct investment since 1997 when this Government first took office. The only semblance of foreign investment is the welcome replacement for the former Antigen by Taro Pharmaceuticals in Roscrea. This Government has presided over the most substantial job losses in Nenagh, Roscrea, and Thurles in living memory. Throughout north Tipperary there are five international industries compared with more than 11 companies five years ago. The number of indigenous Irish industries has dropped from almost 90 in 1993 to fewer than 70 in 2003. When Aventis Pharma in Nenagh closed with the loss of 230 jobs in April 2002, I referred to north Tipperary as an &ldquo;unemployment blackspot created in the midst of the greatest period of prosperity the nation has known&rdquo;. The Government has done nothing since, in four years, to reverse this. We have had no investment, no research and development funding and no new jobs. This Government has failed the people of north Tipperary.</P><Col N="120"/>
        <P>This Government meddled with existing administrative structures which had a proven track record of success and had delivered to north Tipperary. In recent years misguided ministerial initiatives have left State agencies with responsibility for industrial development and job creation in north Tipperary confused, demoralised and lacking any sense of cohesion or direction.</P>
        <P>The number of entrepreneurs and business people visiting north Tipperary has declined dramatically. In a recent parliamentary question, I was astounded when it was revealed that not a single industrialist has visited north Tipperary since 2003. Shannon Development, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have not organised a single visit for any potential investor to north Tipperary in three years. At a time when investment is locating to other parts of the country, it is inexcusable that the Minister and the employment creation agencies have continuously overlooked north Tipperary.</P>
        <P>I am calling on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to respond to the emerging employment crisis now facing Thurles and north Tipperary. The Minister must take immediate steps to encourage industrialists and investors to locate in north Tipperary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry"><NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Minister and the Government that the unemployment and job creation problems of north Tipperary are serious and require a specific co-ordinated response. The Minister must radically reverse the current scenario where no investors have visited north Tipperary for three years by implementing pro-active measures to encourage and attract indigenous and foreign investment to north Tipperary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Lowry for raising this matter.</P>
        <P>I was very concerned to hear that BSN Medical had announced it was to cease manufacturing. I am very conscious of the implications of these job losses for the workers involved and their families, as well as the community in the surrounding area.</P>
        <P>The company was established in Thurles in 2001, having initially established operations under a different name in 1976. The operation in Thurles produces custom made orthopaedic garments on a subcontract basis and ships the garments to 28 countries.</P>
        <P>In July 2005 the company announced it was to reduce its workforce by 40 people with a voluntary redundancy offer. Then, in December 2005 it was announced the company was being sold.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>Earlier this month, IDA Ireland was informed that the company in Thurles was to close with the <Col N="121"/>loss of all remaining jobs and that all production was being consolidated in China. The managing director of the company wrote to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 13 April last stating that, following a major manufacturing review, the company had informed its 80 employees that it would be ceasing the manufacture of orthopaedic soft goods at its Thurles plant by the end of 2006. The decision was due to excess manufacturing capacity and the need to maintain cost competitiveness resulting in a change of manufacturing strategy.</P>
        <P>The priority will be to find alternative employment for those involved. The role of F&Aacute;S, the State training agency, will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs. The full range of F&Aacute;S services will be made available to the employees concerned, if they wish to avail of these services.</P>
        <P>The industrial development agencies are making every effort to secure alternative employment for Thurles and north Tipperary. A central goal for the agencies is the achievement of balanced regional development. Statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to north Tipperary, including the town of Thurles, rests with IDA Ireland. Shannon Development has responsibility for the provision of industrial property solutions in the area. Its role in supporting indigenous enterprise will transfer to Enterprise Ireland under the new mandate granted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to Shannon Development last year.</P>
        <P>Initiatives undertaken by Shannon Development in the provision of property solutions include the development of the Tipperary Technology Park in Thurles and the acquisition of a 29 acre site in Roscrea with a view to developing a business park. These facilities are being actively marketed by IDA Ireland to potential clients through its network of overseas offices. That agency&rsquo;s sectoral emphasis in the mid-west region is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in information communications and technology, globally traded businesses, medical technologies and life sciences.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development, in association with local authorities in the area, is also spearheading a drive to bring high speed Internet access to the region. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has recently approved funding for metropolitan area networks to be installed in a number of towns, which should assist in attracting foreign direct investment and indigenous industry.</P>
        <P>The Tipperary North County Enterprise Board is a source of support, specifically for the micro-businesses sector. The role of the board is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and an enterprise culture within north Tipperary. This is done through both direct financial assistance and non-financial assistance. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, <Col N="122"/>enterprises may qualify for support from the CEB primarily in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants, while there is a broad range of non-financial supports available such as mentoring, business advice, information, management development and training.</P>
        <P>I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies in furtherance of their statutory functions, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Thurles and the wider north Tipperary area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this issue and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, who will respond.</P>
        <P>Although the case I will outline is one I know well, it is probably a mirror image of many other cases around the country. I have come across similar instances previously and I wanted to raise the issue because of my disgust at the way many of these carers are being treated by the Department.</P>
        <P>I want to paint a picture of the circumstances of a person in my constituency with which I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Shea, can empathise. I speak of an 82 year old widow living on her own in a house rented from the local authority. As the years go by, she becomes less mobile and more dependent and she has nobody to look after her. Therefore, her daughter, who is living in London, decides that she will do what is right and come home to look after her mother for the necessary period, be that a number of months or years. Her daughter has voluntarily come home to look after her mother.</P>
        <P>This 82 year old widow has given good service to the State. She brought up her family to respect the State and get on with their work. She never abused the State or did anything like that. She played her part and was an honourable member of society.</P>
        <P>At this time in her life, she should be at the stage where the State is responding to her needs. She would need a home help and sooner rather than later may well need care in a nursing home.</P>
        <P>That care, which should be provided by the State, is being provided by her daughter. Having given up her position in London, she came home to look after her mother and applied, in the normal way as an Irish citizen, for carer&rsquo;s allowance. This application, the processing of which took quite a long of time, was met with a refusal.</P>
        <P>When we investigated why the application was refused, we were told it was because of means. As this lady had provided all the necessary information, we investigated further and discovered the lady in question has an apartment in London. Having lived there much of her life, obviously she <Col N="123"/>would have acquired an apartment. This apartment is mortgaged. When she came home to live and look after her mother, she could not afford to pay for the mortgage in London &mdash; which is quite obvious given that she did not have an income &mdash; so she rented the apartment. The rent on the apartment in London is covering the mortgage, which is reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Department has told her that because she has this property in London, it must be valued. Even though she receives no income from it, it is because she has this apartment that she is now being refused carer&rsquo;s allowance. Did the House ever hear such a ridiculous scenario? This person gave up her lifestyle, her friends and her position in London to come back and look after her mother, to do what is honourable. What do we do to her when she is providing a service to the State? We give her a kick in the teeth. We say that because she is wise and has her own apartment in London, we will not give her carer&rsquo;s allowance. How ridiculous can we get? I have come across many other such cases. I have met people who have come home from America having lived there for years to look after elderly parents and they are treated in the same way. I am sure the Cathaoirleach has also come across this issue in his constituency.</P>
        <P>This is fundamentally flawed, particularly in the way it affects the provision of care. What better care can an elderly person get than the care of his or her own family in his or her home? Why are people being treated like this? Does the Government want to fill private nursing homes or put more people into institutions? I call on the Minister of State to examine this case, which is one of many, in a sympathetic way. I hope, having heard the story, he will empathise with it and will deliver good news.</P>

	<P>The debate relates to the social welfare entitlements of a particular individual. Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims or entitlements are made by deciding officers and appeal officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I, as Minister of State, have no role in making such decisions. The person concerned applied for carer&rsquo;s allowance. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test that applies is satisfied. Additionally, the requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes, including carer&rsquo;s allowance, with effect from 1 May 2004. All applicants regardless of nationality are required to be habitually resident in the State to qualify for the allowance. The basis for the restriction containedin the new rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other <Col N="124"/>factor. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on the application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.</P>
        <P>While the person concerned satisfies the habitual residence condition, the medical eligibility and provision of full-time care and attention requirements, she did not satisfy the means test applicable to carer&rsquo;s allowance. Under social welfare legislation the capital value of property owned but not personally used or enjoyed, where it is rented to a third party, is assessed as means in accordance with a formula set out in legislation. The property in this case is let and was previously the home of the person concerned but that is not relevant in the context of the means test. Such a property cannot be disregarded as &ldquo;your own home&rdquo; in cases where that property is let. Property must be capable of being sold, let or put to profitable use before a capital value assessment is applied. In the case of property that is let, the amount assessed as means is the notional assessment provided for in legislation, not the rental income.</P>
        <P>The income assessed as means in this case consists of &euro;930 per week derived from the capital value of the property and income from an occupational pension of &euro;2l8.72 per week. Following the application of the &euro;270 income disregard that applies the person&rsquo;s weekly means equate to a net &euro;878.72, which exceeds the qualifying limit for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance. A deciding officer decided accordingly. On 8 March 2006 the person concerned was notified of this decision and the reasons for it and of her right to appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office. Following a review by a deciding officer, the decision remains unchanged. A revision to the existing means test that applies would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
        <P>In budget 2005, the respite care grant was extended to all carers providing full-time care and attention. The grant is paid regardless of means but is subject to certain employment-related conditions and the provision of full-time care and attention. On 25 April 2006 the person concerned was notified that she may have an entitlement to the respite care grant for 2006.</P>

	<P>The issue of increasing criminality in Donegal is continuously to the fore and it will not go away unless there is serious intervention from the Government. I witness many crime problems in my constituency in Donegal but, unfortunately, we are not being offered many solutions. With a large part of Donegal bordering <Col N="125"/>Northern Ireland, we are subject to significant additional cross-Border crime. This creates its own problems as it lends itself very well to criminals returning across the Border after perpetrating a crime and, most likely, never getting caught. More effective cross-Border policing is a must to catch the perpetrators of crime. At a time when efforts are being made to re-establish the Assembly and its institutions, I have serious concerns about cross-Border co-operation and the relationship between the Garda in Donegal and its counterpart in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Local newspapers are filled constantly with stories of desecrated schools, private property, commercial premises and so on. One wonders where it will all end. We also experience the problems associated with over-consumption of alcohol and drugs, speeding and drink driving. The list is endless. I had a glance through a local newspaper this morning and it contained reports of cars stolen and damaged, a school broken into and windows smashed for the fifth night in a row, an attack on a young woman at the weekend, damage to a new football pitch caused by cars driving on its surface with one of the cars set alight, windows broken in commercial premises, houses broken into and contents stolen, and a malicious fire in another school. That is an incredible list of crimes in one local newspaper in a rural county such as Donegal.</P>
        <P>Garda resources and manpower in Donegal is the major problem, particularly along the Border. The crime rate in the county will not reduce until a realistic allocation of Garda resources is provided. We are faced with more sophisticated crime and criminals nowadays and, therefore, we need equally sophisticated personnel and equipment to deal with them. Donegal is largely a rural county and if criminality cannot be controlled in our rural areas, we have little chance of controlling it in our larger cities.</P>
        <P>I refer to an incident that happened on Easter Sunday morning involving Councillor Francis Conaghan, who is a former chairman of Donegal County Council. Both his vehicles were stolen that morning and they were used in several crimes. If the perpetrators had not been caught in the middle of one crime, God knows how many other crimes would have been committed. However, the perpetrators escaped and wrecked one of the councillor&rsquo;s cars while the other car was recovered with minor damage. The criminals&rsquo; spree was stopped by a householder, not the garda&iacute;, in Manorcunningham. When garda&iacute; were called, it took them 40 minutes to respond and by that time the criminals were long gone. When they arrived, the garda&iacute; did not have as much as a lamp to search around the house. That is why I began to question Garda resources. Many items were taken from the house, including a quantity of money. The perpetrators of the crime escaped back across the Border where they were caught by the PSNI. Thankfully, the PSNI were very co-<Col N="126"/>operative with the two individuals involved in this case in Donegal and have been in contact with them many times. This has not been the case with our local garda&iacute;.</P>

        <P>These have been trying times for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Donegal. Morale among the garda&iacute; there is at an all-time low and the current Minister will have to do something about it. He has not been in Donegal too often in recent years, but I invite him to come to Donegal and see at first hand the problems that exist. I want to see something done about criminality in Donegal. I want to see resources and morale sorted out in the force in Donegal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Blaney for raising this matter. The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda resources, including personnel. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 March 2006 was 12,439. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 on 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737, or 16.2%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The number of garda&iacute; stationed in the Donegal division in 2002 was 416, in 2003 it was 424, in 2004 it was 412, in 2005 it was 417 and on 31 March 2006 it was 433. The necessity for the large Garda presence in the border counties has significantly diminished since the Good Friday Agreement. However, there has been an increase in numbers in Donegal from 416 in 2002 to 433 on 31 March 2006. The divisional resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised units.</P>
        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate the record expansion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007 by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of garda&iacute; under the current programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 16 March, and an additional 21 garda&iacute; were allocated to the Donegal division in conjunction with this incremental increase.</P>
        <P>In response to the disturbing number of road fatalities in the Buncrana district, a Garda traffic corps unit was established in the district on a pilot basis with effect from 20 October 2005. The unit was in addition to the traffic corps personnel already operating in the Donegal division. An evaluation of this pilot programme has concluded and it has been decided that a dedicated traffic corps unit, with increased personnel, will be based in the Inishowen area. This unit will com<Col N="127"/>prise one sergeant and eight garda&iacute;. The visibility provided by the traffic corps unit has also had an influence on the reduction of certain crimes in the area such as burglary and public disorder.</P>
        <P>A number of other initiatives have also taken place in the Donegal division. These include targeted co-ordinated patrolling of priority roads and junctions at prime times, high visibility checkpoints, which have resulted in a 25% increase in the detection of drivers under the influence of an intoxicant in 2006 to date, as well as the reconstitution of the Donegal road safety working group comprising representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Donegal County Council, the Health Service Executive and the National Roads Authority.</P>
        <P>Proposals have been made by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to Donegal County Council in response to the fatal collision at Lisfannon on 18 February. Targeted education is an integral part of road traffic policing and a number of initiatives have been undertaken, including a local media campaign on traffic safety issues, a road safety programme in all primary and secondary schools in the Inishowen area, a driver improvement course in conjunction with the courts and ongoing liaison with driving instructors and the Institute of Advanced Motorists. In co-operation with Inishowen Rural Development Limited, the <Col N="128"/>Garda is assessing the training needs of drivers in the area.</P>
        <P>All Departments and agencies responsible for dealing with road safety related issues are very aware of the urgent necessity of bringing about a steady reduction in the numbers killed and seriously injured on our roads. Government policy in this area is set out in the Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy for the period 2004 to 2006. The strategy sets out an ambitious range of targets, actions and measures to be achieved.</P>
        <P>Concern has been expressed about the adequacy of Garda cover on the Inishowen peninsula. Local Garda management states that there are two 24-hour Garda stations in the Inishowen peninsula based at Burnfoot and Buncrana. In addition, there are 24-hour mobile patrols provided by the divisional traffic and detective units. Garda management is examining the establishment of a rural community policing initiative in north Inishowen. The proposed administrative headquarters for this initiative is Carndonagh Garda station. It is anticipated that this initiative would also provide 24-hour cover for the north Inishowen area. I thank Deputy Blaney again for bringing this matter to the attention to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>As the House is aware, I am not responsible for implementing Transport 21. That responsibility lies with my colleague the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 addresses many issues of importance to tourism development. My Department has developed a close policy relationship with the Department of Transport on issues of concern to tourism. It has also been in dialogue with the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This dialogue has also been facilitated by the tourism action plan implementation group.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the regional tourism authorities identified a number of routes which they considered of key interest from a tourism perspective and these have been communicated to the relevant authorities.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 identifies a number of national secondary roads for improvement such as the N56 &mdash; Donegal-Letterkenny coastal route; the N59 &mdash; Mayo-Galway coastal route; the N67 &mdash; Clare coastal route; the N69 &mdash; Limerick-Tralee route; the N70 &mdash; Ring of Kerry; the N71 &mdash; west Cork coastal route; and the N86 &mdash; Tralee-Dingle route. The inclusion of these key tourism routes in Transport 21 indicates the importance with which the Government views the economic contribution of the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a new environmental unit which is taking a more active role in regard to environmental, planning and infrastructure issues. Through its role as a prescribed body in the planning process, F&aacute;ilte Ireland inputs on an ongoing basis to proposals for new road and rail projects. It is currently engaging in the consul<Col N="130"/>tation stage of the route selection for the metro north in Dublin.</P>
        <P>It is also liaising with the National Roads Authority on the identification of priorities for tourist signposting as part of the implementation of a major four-year programme to improve directional signage on national routes. This involves a review of the 1988 guidelines on tourist signposting in Ireland.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to develop its relationship with the Department of Transport and other key transport players to ensure, as far as possible, that the implementation of Transport 21 reflects the continuing needs and priorities of the tourism sector.</P>

	<P>My Department supports capital arts projects through the arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme or ACCESS scheme. Under the ACCESS scheme, 180 applications were received and 44 of these were selected for funding in 2001. A total of &euro;45.71 million was available for the scheme but applications for grant aid of &pound;224 million were received. All the funds under the current scheme have been fully allocated. Difficult decisions had to be made and many worthwhile projects, including this one, were not successful on that occasion.</P>
        <P>I hope to announce a successor to the ACCESS scheme in the near future. Applications for any such successor scheme will be invited by public advertisement. Applications will be assessed in an objective way on the basis of clear and transparent evidence and advice. I will be meeting shortly with representatives from the Monaghan theatre project to discuss the project in greater detail.</P>

        <QRef>[15151/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Last month I launched an economic impact report on the 2005 Punchestown festival, carried out by NUI, Maynooth. The report estimated that the economic contribution of the <Col N="131"/>Punchestown festival is in the region of &euro;43 million. The report calculates the direct economic effect of the Punchestown festival to be almost &euro;33 million. During the four days of the festival on-course spending totalled &euro;7.6 million, off-course expenditure including accommodation, food and entertainment was &euro;17.8 million while a further &euro;7.5 million was spent on travel and subsistence. To this estimate of direct expenditure, the report added an additional &euro;10 million in a multiplier of indirect economic effects. When added together these figures bring the total estimated economic contribution of the Punchestown festival to almost &euro;43 million.</P>
        <P>The report also reveals that almost one fifth of attendees at the festival were from overseas, mainly the UK, demonstrating the attractiveness of the Punchestown festival as a key leisure and tourism event in Ireland. The report underlines the significance of horse racing economically and as a tourist attraction in Ireland, it also reinforces the fact that the Irish racing industry contributes to the social and economic fabric of Irish life.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the HRI specifically targets overseas visitors to Irish race meetings particularly racegoers in the UK. For 2006, it has earmarked approximately &euro;200,000 for overseas promotion of horseracing. The UK racegoer in particular presents an outstanding opportunity for inward tourism based on the Irish racing product. It is estimated that in the region of 60,000 UK visitors come racing here each year and the three agencies, Horse Racing Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland consider that there is substantial potential for growth from this market given the fact that in excess of 6 million attendances are recorded annually at race meetings in the UK.</P>
        <P>This is a highly affluent target sector with a propensity to spend on hotels, restaurant, car hire and other forms of entertainment. UK racegoers are used to paying as much as double the Irish rate for reserved enclosure access, which, combined with the favourable sterling-euro exchange rate, give us an unprecedented opportunity to offer a high quality racing experience at relatively better value than is available in the UK.</P>
        <P>In addition to its own initiatives, HRI has a long-standing relationship with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in jointly promoting Ireland as a destination for Racing Tourism. At the behest of my Department, the three agencies are actively exploring possible synergies and in that context, HRI specifically identified the Punchestown festival as an attractive event to grow inbound racing tourism and committed to a significant marketing campaign in the UK in 2006 as part of a joint campaign with both tourism agencies.</P>
        <P>The Government has ensured the success of the horseracing industry by putting in place the long-term financial structures, the funding and the conditions in which Irish horse racing now <Col N="132"/>flourishes. The recent report demonstrates how that investment and commitment is paying back in economic terms. I am confident that the combined expertise of the HRI, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland will produce the right result for horseracing and for tourism particularly in the promotion of the Punchestown festival as an Irish Cheltenham.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport</askee>
        <Quest>and Tourism if his attention has been drawn to the recent information provided by the American Consulate that there is an increasing level of violent crime against tourists here, including a high incidence of petty crime, mostly theft, burglary and purse snatching in major tourist areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15163/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I am familiar with the US consular information sheet in question. US consular information sheets are routinely issued by the US Department of State, in reespect of individual countries, for the guidance of US citizens travelling abroad. They should not be confused with travel warnings. These sheets cover basic topics of interest to travellers, including potential hazards. Topics include entry requirements, security situation, medical emergencies, crime, banking, transport, etc. I understand that the sheets are updated annually, usually in March.</P>
        <P>The information sheet on Ireland notes that although Ireland has, historically, had a low rate of violent crime, it is increasing. It is clear, in the sheet, however, that crime against tourists is limited in number. The information sheet does refer to a high incidence of petty crime in major tourist areas but there is nothing surprising about that given that Dublin, the major tourist centre, also accounts for a significant proportion of general crime.</P>
        <P>We would be doing ourselves a disservice to focus on what I would regard as the rather mildly stated negatives in this sheet. It is instructive to read the content of similar sheets for other major European destinations. Ireland is a safe destination and regarded as such. The rate of crime against tourists is very low to the best of our knowledge. In 2005, the Irish Tourist Assistance Service had 293 referrals which involved 496 people and the rate of referrals has been decreasing.</P>
        <P>Of the 293 referrals to the Irish Tourist Assistance Service in 2005, 200 were in respect of theft from the person or theft from cars and only 11 were cases of violent crime against tourists compared with 36 cases in 2004. Given that last year we had almost 7 million overseas visitors, it is fair to emphasise that Ireland, for the great majority of holidaymakers, is a very safe tourist destination. The latest F&aacute;ilte Ireland Visitor Attitudes <Col N="133"/>Survey reports that 89% of US visitors are very satisfied with the security and safety aspects of their Irish visit.</P>

	<P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing funding to develop sporting infrastructure at local, regional and national level. Applications under the programme are accepted from sporting and voluntary and community organisations and, in certain circumstances, from schools and local authorities. Applications under the programme are assessed in accordance with a detailed set of criteria covering the main objectives of the programme. Successful applicants must submit evidence, which is examined by our technical supervisors &mdash; the Office of Public Works, showing that the project complies with building regulations.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the sports capital programme is to assist clubs and organisations to provide good quality indoor and outdoor sports facilities which enable and encourage people to take an active role in sport and physical recreation, increase participation and raise standards at all levels of sport in Ireland. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to provide assistance towards solar energy conversion systems from funds voted specifically for the development of sport and physical recreation.</P>

	<P>The hosting of the Ryder Cup at the K Club in September is a key event for Irish tourism this year and is also a unique opportunity to market all that Ireland has to offer as a tourism destination. The exploitation of that opportunity is a matter for the two tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland Limited.</P>
        <P>While the event will undoubtedly contribute significantly to overseas tourism revenues in 2006, the principal benefits of the agreement between Ireland and the European Tour will flow from the promotional package that is part of the agree<Col N="134"/>ment and which has extended over the nine years since the agreement was signed. In this context, the Government has made a significant level of resources available to ensure that the tourism spin-off to Ireland and to golfing tourism in particular is maximised.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The Ryder Cup promotional programme is not just about promoting Ireland as a premium golf destination. The media coverage of this major sporting event presents a unique opportunity to market all that Ireland has to offer as a tourism destination. To that end, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have been working closely together over the last number of years in the lead up to the event to optimise the promotional spin-off, and Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas market offices are being deployed to maximise the positive publicity which the TV coverage, with an expected audience of over 1 billion in 150 countries, will generate.</P>
        <P>This promotional work will intensify over the course of this year with the allocation of an additional &euro;4.5 million to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in the 2006 Revised Estimates Volume, to support an enhanced programme of marketing and promotional activities around the Ryder Cup, including a national branding programme and a number of golf marketing initiatives. The aim of this programme, to be delivered in conjunction with Tourism Ireland, is to capitalise on the opportunities offered by the unique event that is the Ryder Cup with a view to promoting an enduring positive image of Irish tourism. F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also engage with the European Tour for delivery of an appropriate complementary programme of events around the Ryder Cup, including the official opening and closing ceremonies and other initiatives intended to raise the profile of the occasion both within Ireland and internationally. Overall, Ireland&rsquo;s hosting of the Ryder Cup has involved one of the most intensive and sustained tourism event promotion programmes ever undertaken and I have no doubt that the event will be an exciting and spectacular culmination to this campaign.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that last November Spencer Dock International Conference Centre Consortium was, with the approval of the Government, designated as the provisional preferred tenderer for the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the competition process, the contracting authority, the Office of Public Works, proceeded to engage with the provisional preferred tenderer to negotiate, settle and agree any required amendments to the project agreement. These detailed and complex negotiations are, by their nature, time consuming but, I understand, the contracting authority is pressing to have them concluded as soon as possible. Assuming that these negotiations prove successful, the next step will be the appointment of the provisional preferred tenderer as preferred tenderer. During the preferred tenderer phase, the preferred tenderer will develop and provide the full range of project documents, which will require review and approval by the contracting authority. I look forward to the timely completion of the next stages and hope to be in a position to bring the matter to Government for final decision in the coming months. Subject to the successful completion of the remaining stages of the procurement process and assuming no unexpected developments, I would hope that construction of the NCC would begin next year and that the centre would be operational during 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 86 together.</P>
        <P>The Government on 12 April 2006 approved the acquisition this year of the Earlsfort Terrace site from the UCD authorities as the preferred location for the new National Concert Hall. Arrangements for the transfer of ownership of the site from UCD to the State are now in train.</P>
        <P>The Government has also decided that the new National Concert Hall will be procured as a public private partnership on a design, build, finance and maintain basis, subject to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Minister for Finance being satisfied with the outcome of an evaluation of the economic benefits of the project which I will be commissioning over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>It was also decided that the construction contract should be structured so as to optimise construction and cost efficiencies. This will speed up considerably the procurement of the new concert hall. It had previously been envisaged that the project would be undertaken on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>The key elements of the outline development plan are: a new concert hall incorporating a main auditorium with a seating capacity for 2,000 patrons and meeting the requirement for open disabled access; the existing auditorium to be preserved for use as a rehearsal, general purpose and technical recording-broadcast space; a flexible smaller hall with a seating capacity of 500, enabling smaller concerts to proceed simultaneously with performances in the main concert hall; easy access for large articulated trucks transporting orchestral and concert equipment; and the Earlsfort Terrace buildings would be reunited with the Iveagh Gardens facilitating increased public access. New public rooms, cafes and restaurants would overlook the gardens and the city.</P>

	<P>Tourism Ireland was established in 2000 under the framework of the Good Friday Agreement to increase tourism to the island of Ireland as a whole. It is jointly funded on a North-South basis. This year I have allocated over &euro;45 million in Exchequer funding to the company and Northern Ireland has committed over &euro;19 million.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland delivers on its mandate through: undertaking destination-marketing programmes to stimulate demand for visiting the island of Ireland; facilitating and supporting business links to improve distribution of the Ireland tourism product to potential consumers; and acting as an advocate for overseas consumers and trade to influence the quality of the tourism experience on the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Clearly there have been specific benefits to the single destination approach. Visitors to the island of Ireland have increased every year since the all-island overseas marketing body Tourism Ireland was formed. In this jurisdiction, the number of visitors has increased by more than 16% in the period from 2001 to 2005. The expenditure by these visitors has grown by almost 20%. In Northern Ireland, the results have also been very positive with growth in tourism numbers of about 30% in that period. There has also been a significant increase in the number of overseas visitors travelling north and south of the Border in recent years &mdash; amounting to more than 370,000 in 2004.</P>
        <P>Central to Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s success is the &ldquo;Island of Ireland&rdquo; brand, which has just been refreshed in response to consumer research in our main markets and Britain in particular. Since its inception, Tourism Ireland has rapidly developed into one of the most effective tourism marketing agencies in the world, one that is committed to staying ahead of the game internationally. The most recent example of this commitment was the launch of its new suite of 27 websites to market Ireland internationally which I, along with my Northern Irish counterpart, Minister Angela Smith, attended in Belfast in March. From a North-South perspective, the launch of this suite of websites was also very significant in that it represented the culmination of many months work by the key tourism players on this island &mdash; Tourism Ireland in close collaboration with the industry on the island, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland. All of them played a vital part in developing this website &mdash; not only through their participation in the e-marketing partnership group &mdash; but in working towards a comprehensive e-marketing strategy for the island of Ireland.</P><Col N="138"/>
        <P>In the wider political context, we are at a crucial stage in delivering on the promise contained in the Good Friday Agreement. North-South co-operation has, time and again, proven extremely important in highlighting the practical benefits of working more closely together on this island. We continually see the practical outcomes of North-South co-operation. The work of the tourism agencies, North and South, and their business partners continues to inspire all of those who are working towards a vision of an island economy based on practical co-operation and mutual benefit.</P>
        <P>Through the all-island tourism marketing partnership, the three tourism agencies &mdash; Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board &mdash; together with the industry on the island are working to develop a cohesive and integrated approach to their overseas marketing activities, including potential synergies in niche-special interest tourism areas.</P>
        <P>Apart from the international marketing of Ireland as a single tourist destination, there have also been a number of domestic initiatives to promote cross-Border tourism, which have been supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, including: Rally Ireland, the cross-Border event held in March to showcase Ireland as a suitable venue for a World Rally Championship event; the North West Passage tourist route; the North West Trail for cycling and walking; Destination North West, a cross-border co-operative arrangement between tourism development and marketing agencies in the north west region. Glens and Lakelands is a similar linked venture covering Cavan, Monaghan and parts of Antrim. The Green Box Eco-Tourism project, an EU-funded project designating a cross-Border area as Ireland&rsquo;s first integrated eco-tourism destination. This also incorporates the EU-funded Kingfisher Cycle trail. There is North-South co-operation in the field of tourism statistics. The development of closer co-operation on tourism research has also been identified as a key priority going forward.</P>
        <P>Throughout 2006, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be undertaking a major marketing campaign in Northern Ireland to attract more Northern Irish visitors to the South. Expenditure by visitors here from Northern Ireland was up by 3% in 2005 with clear potential for further growth. The Northern Irish Tourist Board recently estimated a 6% increase in visitors to Northern Ireland from the South.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently launched the 2005 annual report of the anti-doping unit of the Irish Sports Council, ISC. The Government has consistently supported the ISC&rsquo;s work in combating doping in sport. While the moral argument against doping is not in doubt and the practice of doping is regularly exposed, there is a need for sustained vigilance. The ISC ensures that there is no complacency in Ireland by operating an excellent anti-doping programme, recognised internationally as an outstanding model of its type.</P>
        <P>A co-ordinated international effort is required, based on effective national programmes to counteract doping in sport. Ireland is to the forefront in the drive for greater international co-operation in the fight against doping through its support for the Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping, the World Anti-Doping Agency, the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention and the proposed new Global Anti-Doping Convention under the aegis of UNESCO.</P>
        <P>In supporting sport the Government insists that it must be based on fair and ethical principles. The ISC has put in place a comprehensive and effective anti-doping programme, one that the Government is happy to endorse, support and fund. The year 2005 was the first full year of operation for this programme. A total of 962 tests were carried out in 2005, including 147 user pays tests. Out of competition tests accounted for 55% of testing under the national programme, 38 sports were subject to testing, with 76 tests overseas. The number of tests is high by international standards and the number carried out in 2005 demonstrates the comprehensive nature of the programme. The programme identifies those who use prohibited substances and reassures us about the vast majority who do not.</P>
        <P>The testing programme threw up two samples which tested positive in two different sports &mdash; squash and rugby. Both cases were for cannabinoids and I understand that appropriate sanctions were imposed in each case.</P>
        <P>All top level athletes in Ireland are included in the testing pool. They are aware that they are liable for testing under the comprehensive Irish programme, as well as their responsibilities to their international federations. I am satisfied that there is a significant deterrent effect in operation and that athletes are aware fully of the dangers and risks involved in doping.</P>

	<P>My Department supports the film industry in Ireland at a number of levels. The Irish Film Board, is the independent statutory agency under my Department&rsquo;s aegis, charged with the delivery of a number of supports to the industry. These supports are provided to a range of operators in the industry, from emerging producers to more experienced players at the international level. The board is also responsible for overseas marketing of Ireland as a filming location. My Department&rsquo;s support for the Irish Film Board increased from &euro;11.85 million in 2004 to &euro;17.126 million in 2006, a significant increase of 44%.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the tax incentive for film production available under section 481 of the Taxes (Consolidation) Act 1997 is a critical part of what we can offer international film producers. Just over a year ago the Government decided to extend the availability of this incentive to 2008 at least. The value of the incentive has been further increased by the enactment of a provision in the Finance Act 2006 increasing the maximum amount that can be raised per film from &euro;15 million to &euro;35 million. It will now be possible to raise up to 80% of the total cost of making a film, which represents a significant improvement over the previous existing limit of between 55% and 66%. While these changes require EU approval, they have been extremely well received in Ireland and overseas, and are seen as doing much to restore our competitiveness as a location for international filmmakers. Informal indications are that the industry is already seeing some strengthening of activity, and the changes referred to above, once they feed into the system, should make a very significant additional difference.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 94 together.</P>
        <P>The report of the tourism policy review group, New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action, was published in September 2003. It contained a very practical action plan. It had a timeframe for implementation and, more importantly, a strong and public monitoring mechanism. Following its publication, I appointed the tourism action plan implementation group to help oversee its implementation. The final report of the group was presented to me last month. Having placed it before Cabinet, I arranged for its publication and it is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The New Horizons report contained ambitious targets for the industry, namely to achieve annual figures of 10 million visitors and &euro;6 billion in foreign revenue by 2012. The action plan had a series of recommendations to be implemented to help meet those targets. The group reported that 63 of the 76 recommendations made in New Horizons report had either been implemented or good progress had been made in relation to them. A detailed analysis of the progress of each of the 76 recommendations is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The implementation group, expressed itself satisfied with the degree of progress in implementing the strategy, which it described as &ldquo;in many ways better than what was anticipated by the implementation group when it first met almost 2 years ago&rdquo;. The group highlighted the areas where good progress has been made. These include: the national conference centre; increases in air access; the proposed bilateral air agreement with the US. It also pointed to a number of areas where progress has been limited. These include: loss of competitiveness; the need for constant innovation and product development in the sector; diverging performance in urban and rural areas; closure of areas which enjoyed traditional long-term public access; visitor experience at Dublin Airport; and VAT on conference business.</P>
        <P>The Deputy touched on a number of specific points in his question. The group made the point that the competitiveness of the traded sector in Ireland, including tourism, has deteriorated in recent years. High costs, what the group calls the &ldquo;sometimes opportunistic pricing practices by certain operators&rdquo; and the comparatively low productivity in the services sector do not help either. The group acknowledged the significant steps taken by many enterprises within the industry to address competitiveness. As a reflection of how seriously the tourism industry views competitiveness, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation commissioned a major study to assist in developing new initiatives to address the problem. I understand that this study will be completed shortly.</P><Col N="142"/>
        <P>The group emphasised the fact high quality cultural facilities can play a major role in attracting visitors to Ireland. This is borne out by much recent Tourism Ireland research.</P>
        <P>The group acknowledged the major progress in relation to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of cultural infrastructure. In December 2005, I announced a package of capital investment in key elements of our national cultural infrastructure. The package includes: the relocation of the Abbey Theatre; the development of a new National Concert Hall complex; the complete remodelling of the Theatre Royal in Wexford; and the substantial refurbishment of the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Dublin Airport will be the first and last impression of Ireland for many of our visitors. We all know that the quality of the passenger experience in Dublin Airport has not been what we would wish it to be in recent years. The group made that point to those responsible at both policy and operational level.</P>
        <P>There are grounds for optimism. There is a new team in the airport and it has announced its plans to tackle the problems. I want to see those plans implemented as soon as possible. The medium-term plans will increase terminal capacity to cater for up to 30 million passengers, including a new terminal and associated pier facilities that will be provided to the south of the existing terminal. These facilities are due to come on stream in 2009. There is also provision for the construction of a new pier in 2007. These developments will be important in responding to passenger requirements and thereby improving the attractiveness of the airport to visitors.</P>

	<P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, the company charged with developing the sports campus project, have drawn up a detailed proposal for the development of the sports campus at Abbotstown in a series of phases. Planning work for phase one of the development control plan is already under way and will provide: a national field sports training centre, catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a national indoor training centre which will provide world class training facilities for over 30 governing bodies of sport; accom<Col N="143"/>modation for sports men and women; sports science and medical facilities; all-weather synthetic pitches for community use; and renovation of existing buildings to cater for needs identified by sports bodies.</P>
        <P>Funds for the delivery of the project have been provided in my Department&rsquo;s capital envelope for 2006-10. The estimated cost of the project is &euro;119 million with a four to five-year delivery schedule &mdash; 2006-10. An amount of &euro;9.5 million has been provided in the Vote of my Department for work on the project during 2006.</P>
        <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited is now proceeding with the delivery of the Abbotstown sports campus. As regards the London Olympics in 2012, I am very conscious of the need to have top class sport facilities in place in good time to provide good training opportunities for Irish athletes and I am determined to build on the Government&rsquo;s existing policy on sports provision at national, regional and local level by having the essential elements of the facility in place in time to allow both Irish and visiting athletes train for the 2012 Olympics here in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that since 1998 funding to the value of &euro;395 million has been allocated to 4,923 projects throughout the country, many of which are used by our Olympic participants. Furthermore, the Irish Sports Council is vigorously implementing its high performance strategy which includes a range of supports for our elite performers. The annual budget of the Irish Sports Council has increased from &euro;13 million in 2000 to more than &euro;40 million this year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I refer the Deputy to my previous statements to the House in which I have made my position perfectly clear in this matter. It is worth, however, reiterating two important points that are central to the stadium at Tallaght. First, in supporting the completion of a soccer stadium at Tallaght, I am honouring a long-standing Government decision made under the sports capital programme. To agree to anything other than a soccer stadium would be to renege on previous <Col N="145"/>commitments given to the FAI. Even when finished to the specifications of a soccer stadium, it will provide capacity for 6,000 spectators which is the capacity decreed under the planning approval. A larger pitch cannot easily be accommodated within the present site given the buildings already in place and would mean that the proposed stand on the opposite side to the partially completed stand would be reduced, thus limiting the overall capacity to about 4,500.</P>
        <P>Second, while the stadium is scheduled for completion as a soccer facility, I would have no objections to South Dublin County Council, which will manage the facility, considering its use for other sporting events compatible with it remaining available for senior soccer fixtures.</P>
        <P>The disappointment I expressed recently with the local GAA clubs involved revolves around both of these key points. At no stage was the site at Tallaght earmarked for development as a GAA facility and at no point has a GAA stadium of the size envisaged at Tallaght been identified as a priority by the GAA in Dublin. I have already indicated a willingness to favourably consider any application for funding in respect of the proposed GAA sports facility at Rathcoole in south county Dublin.</P>

	<P>I have previously indicated my willingness to support the South Dublin County Council in putting together a financial package to ensure the completion of the soccer stadium at Tallaght. Following the recent decision by South Dublin County Council to proceed with the completion of the stadium at Tallaght to the specification originally planned, my Department has been in contact with council officials. It has been agreed that on receipt of a submission from South Dublin County Council outlining the project costs and the required funding, consideration will be given to the provision of funding from my Department to support the completion of the stadium.</P>
        <P>I am advised by South Dublin County Council that it is currently focused on work associated with the judicial review proceedings served by a local GAA club which are listed for initial hearing in the High Court on 8 May 2006.</P>

	<P>Negotiations on a successor agreement to Sustaining Progress are being conducted on a strand-based approach and the first strand has been focusing on the issue of employment standards. It is accepted that it is the congress position that significant progress will be made in this first strand before any substantial engagement takes place around core pay issues.</P>
        <P>Several meetings have been held in this regard and contacts are ongoing with a view to establishing the scope and possibilities that exist for agreement on the issue. While no date has been set for the conclusion of negotiations, it is hoped that, with goodwill and flexibility on all sides, we will be able to move on soon to address pay and other workplace related issues.</P>
        <P>A number of plenary and bilateral meetings have also taken place with each of the four pillars &mdash; trade union, business-employer, farming and community and voluntary &mdash; which have discussed, <i>inter alia</i>, the NESC report on the Developmental Welfare State; the Fitzpatrick Associates review of the special initiatives implemented under Sustaining Progress; the implications of the proposed longer-term framework for social partnership; the macro-economic context for the negotiations; the economic, environmental, infrastructural and social policy priorities within a new agreement; and the wider non-pay issues and priorities, where the social partners have agreed that a longer-term perspective is appropriate for full implementation.</P><Col N="154"/>
        <P>Following on from the initial round of multilateral engagement, as outlined above, it is intended that draft text in relation to the economic, environmental, infrastructural and social policy priorities will be circulated for comment in the next round of multilateral engagement in the negotiations, which have resumed this week, commencing 24 April, after the Easter recess.</P>
        <P>Officials of the relevant Departments are participating in the talks. The positions to be finally agreed in the context of these talks will reflect the Government&rsquo;s policy priorities, since the response to the social partners in the talks is determined by my colleagues and me.</P>

	<P>At present, some 5% of my Department&rsquo;s staff are available to provide services in Irish. The greatest demand for service in Irish comes in the form of written correspondence or telephone queries from the public. These queries are dealt with by referring them to staff who have an appropriate level of proficiency in Irish.</P>
        <P>To support such staff members, and to encourage others to develop their Irish language skills, my Department has provided a range of resources, including in-house Irish language classes. I am satisfied that this system is appropriate to the demand my Department currently experiences and it will be monitored in the light of evolving demand.</P>

	<P>In line with the recommendations in the final report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on Judge Barron&rsquo;s report into the Dublin-Monaghan Bombings of 1974, the MacEntee Commission of Investigation was established to examine certain aspects of the investigation in this jurisdiction of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974, arising from findings made by Mr. Justice Barron.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights also recommended that a public tribunal of inquiry in Northern Ireland and-or Great Britain be established. It was recommended that the terms of reference should be agreed between the two Governments and should be based on Weston Park proposals. The British Government has indicated that it does not intend to establish such a public tribunal of inquiry.</P>
        <P>The sub-committee recommended that if there was a lack of co-operation on this matter from the Government or authorities in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, that the Irish Government should consider instituting proceedings in the <Col N="156"/>European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, seeking appropriate declaratory relief against the UK, requiring it to put in place an appropriate investigation.</P>
        <P>I have received advice from the Attorney General in relation to bringing a case to the ECHR. The Attorney General was in turn able to draw on the expertise of a number of experts in this field of law. The essence of the advice is that there are great difficulties in the Government bringing a successful case against the British Government in the ECHR. I am not in favour, nor is the Attorney General, of bringing a case such as this if we cannot be confident of winning it.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 107 together.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have a legal adviser. Any legal advice required is sought from the Office of the Attorney General. The Attorney General is legal adviser to the Government and attends Government meetings in that capacity.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of developments since the 1997 Report of the Review Group on the Law Offices, which was published on 24 February 1998, namely: the Office of the Attorney General, including the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, as indicated in its statements of strategy, annual reports and other publications, organises itself so that lawyers specialise in a range of legal areas so as to be best placed to meet the underlying needs of its client Departments-offices; the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, in their periodic review meetings with Departments and offices, their operation of their client and customer charters and the formation by the Office of the Attorney General of its client panel, which had its inaugural meeting last November, are in close contact with their clients and customers and the Departments who engage their own legal advisers; and the Office of the Attorney General has been consulted on the long-term engagement of new legal advisers by certain Departments and has indeed been represented on relevant interview selection boards.</P>
        <P>The most recent development has been the agreement reached between the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance on the recruitment by the office of a number of advisory counsel who will be trained by the office, prior to secondment to Departments who are seeking legal advisers. Pursuant to this agreement, the Office of the Attorney General, in co-operation with the Public Appointments Service, recently ran a competition and the first recruits are to take up duty in the office on 2 and 8 May, respectively. Two or three further appointments are envisaged as five Departments have agreed, in principle, to the arrangement. The office is currently finalising protocols to be agreed with the relevant Departments. This initiative is in line with conclusions reached in the Travers report on <Col N="158"/>administration matters in the Department of Health and Children and recommendations of the appropriate Oireachtas joint committee thereon.</P>
        <P>Most legal advice given by the Office of the Attorney General to State bodies follows requests from the appropriate Department and includes bodies such as the Office of Public Works, the Central Statistics Office, the Registrar General, the Adoption Board, the Garda, the Companies Registration Office, the Land Registry, the Public Appointments Service, the State Laboratory and, on occasion, the Office of Tobacco Control.</P>

	<P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997 give effect to Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 and provide for notification to, and inspection by the Health Service Executive of pre-school services. There is no registration system for pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cr&egrave;ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age. The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the implementation of these regulations.</P>
        <P>A childminder should look after no more than six pre-school children, including her own pre-school children, and no more than three of these should be under the age of one.</P>
        <P>Some childminders are exempted from the requirements of the regulations. These are a person taking care of children of relatives, a sibling group or not more than three pre-school children of different families &mdash; other than that person&rsquo;s own such children &mdash; in that person&rsquo;s home. A voluntary notification and support system is in place since 2001 for such childminders. On voluntary notification to the childminder advisory service, which is operated at local level through the city and county child care committees-Health Service Executive, childminders are put in contact with their local childminder advisory officer. <Col N="159"/>The childminder advisory officers provide networking opportunities, advice, advisory visits, support and training for childminders who voluntarily notify.</P>

	<P>There is no legal definition of after-school child care, but it is a term used to describe a type of out-of-school child care and school-age child care. Of these terms, the one generally used by the child care directorate of the Office of the Minister for Children under the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is school-age child care, which encompasses all such services. A report entitled, Developing School Age Childcare, was compiled by a working group of the national child care co-ordinating committee and published last year by the directorate. For the purposes of that report, the working group defined school-age child care as being:</P>
        <P LI="1">Child care for school-going children provided outside of normal school hours where the same children attend the child care facility on a regular basis and access to the service is clearly defined by agreement with parents and guardians.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The term &ldquo;after-school child care&rdquo; would generally refer to such a service which takes place after school hours during the school term. However, other school-age or &ldquo;out-of-school&rdquo; child care facilities may open before the school day, from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and-or during school holidays. There is a variety of such services provided, which reflects the diverse needs of families for such child care. There is no registration system in place for school-age child care.</P>

	<P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997 give effect to Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 and provide for notification to, and inspection by, the Health <Col N="160"/>Service Executive of pre-school services. There is no registration system for pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cr&egrave;ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age. The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the implementation of these regulations.</P>
        <P>Judgments as to whether a pre-school service is in compliance with the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997 are made on inspection by the pre-school services inspection teams of the Health Service Executive. School-age child care services are not subject to child care legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The health contribution was introduced by virtue of the Health Contributions Act 1979 and came into effect on 6 April of that year. The contributions are levied on income at a percentage rate set in pursuance of the Health Contributions Act and proceeds are paid over to the Minister for Health and Children in aid of the Vote for the Health Service Executive. The current rate of contribution is 2% of gross income. The levy is applicable to all persons over the age of 16 with reckonable income, earnings or emoluments. However, certain persons are exempt from liability to pay the health levy, including those who have full eligibility for health services, i.e. medical card holders under section 45 of the Health Act 1970. Following the announcement in the 2001 budget to grant full eligibility to those aged 70 and over, and the subsequent amendment of section 45 of the Health Act 1970, these pesons became exempt from paying health contributions. The cost to the Exchequer of including people who possess over-70 medical cards in the exemption from paying the health levy amounts to approximately &euro;15 million per annum.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that legal lecture No. 12 relating to offences committed within the family is allocated three hours lecture time under phase 1 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na training programme and a further two hours under phase 3.</P>
        <P>The lecture covers all matters relevant to the Domestic Violence Act 1996, including barring, protection and safety orders; arrest powers, procedures to follow, advice to be given, bail issues; the Children Act 1908 and related matters; the Childcare Act 1991, including the duties of the health boards and courts in matters of child care. There is no differentiation made between male and female victims of domestic violence when presenting these lectures.</P>
        <P>Domestic violence training is also provided by the social studies section under phase 1 and phase 3, following which student garda&iacute; are fully briefed on all aspects of the law on domestic violence. During experiential learning phases of training, student garda&iacute; would also be exposed, under the supervision of tutors, to dealing with real cases of domestic violence.</P>
        <P>Also under phase 3 training, Women&rsquo;s Aid attend the Garda College and spend four hours with each class of 24 students educating them on issues of domestic violence. Women&rsquo;s Aid deals with violence against both women and men. This learning is put into practice by way of role-play which enhances the students&rsquo; abilities to deal with domestic violence, both lawfully and professionally.</P>
        <P>Student garda&iacute; can expect to receive a minimum of eight to ten hours training on all aspects of domestic violence. I am advised by Garda management that the issue of further training in the area for general members is being researched for inclusion in the continuous professional development core programme for 2007.</P>

	<P>The mobility allowance is a monthly payment administered by the Health Service Executive, which provides financial support for severely disabled people who <Col N="167"/>are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.</P>
        <P>To be eligible to receive the mobility allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years. However, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after the age of 66 as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met. I have no proposals to amend this scheme.</P>

The executive&rsquo;s parliamentary affairs division provides a central contact for all requests for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the executive.</P>
        <P>Last January I circulated an information note to all Members giving details of the executive&rsquo;s arrangements for handling inquiries from Members. This note included a list of contact numbers and e-mail addresses which Members could use to make direct representations to local health areas regarding local health matters. In addition, the chief executive officer of the executive wrote to Members on 1 March 2006 updating the information previously provided and advising of further initiatives being adopted by the executive, which include the establishment of a central dedicated e-mail address through which Members may submit inquiries to the executive and the identification of two dedicated telephone numbers in the executive&rsquo;s central parliamentary affairs office to enable Members to obtain assistance with inquiries.</P>

        <P>I have met representatives of BreastCheck and they are aware of my wish to have the programme rolled out to the remaining regions as quickly as possible. For this to happen, essential elements of the roll-out must be in place, including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes. I have made additional revenue funding of &euro;2.3 million available to BreastCheck this year to provide for the early recruitment and training of staff. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of the roll-out to southern and western regions will be met; a more exact date for the roll-out will depend on the availability of adequately trained medical and technical staff, particularly radiographers.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck recently interviewed for clinical directors for both regions and is in the process of making appointments. BreastCheck is also recruiting radiographers and a second consultant radiologist for each region. BreastCheck recently received planning permission for the new clinical units at University College Hospital Galway and the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork and is now proceeding to tender for their construction.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Different eligibility criteria govern the supply of medication without charge and the domiciliary care allowance respectively. Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the long-term illness scheme. The conditions include mental handicap, mental illness, for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to the scheme&rsquo;s patients. Other products are available according to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility.</P>
        <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the long-term illness scheme can use the drug payment scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month, or approximately &euro;20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. In addition, non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>
        <P>Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly allowance administered by the Health Service Executive and may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to a means test.</P>
        <P>Only personal means of the child are taken into account. The means of the parents are not considered. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer or other designated medical officer in the relevant community care area to decide whether a child qualifies for domiciliary care allowance.</P>

	<P>A pilot cervical screening programme commenced in 2000 covering the area of the former Mid-Western Health Board. Under the programme, cervical screening is offered, free of charge, to approximately 74,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group, at five year intervals. The evidence internationally is that the risk of developing cervical cancer decreases with age and it is for this reason that the programme has an upper age limit of 60 years. A report on the prog<Col N="180"/>ramme prepared by an international expert has recommended that it should be rolled out nationally in respect of the 25 to 60 year age cohort.</P>
        <P>I am fully committed to the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. The Department has requested the Health Service Executive to prepare a detailed implementation plan for a national programme. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call-recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money. All elements of the programme, call-recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</P>
        <P>Significant preparatory work is well under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register. I made available an additional &euro;9 million to the executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for the roll-out.</P>
        <P>Outside of this pilot programme, women seeking cervical smear tests are charged for the service unless it forms part of a recognised protocol for the ongoing treatment of an individual patient&rsquo;s illness. Any necessary follow up treatment is available to all women within the public hospital system.</P>

	<P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, is currently available to women in the 50 to 64 age group in the eastern, north-eastern, south-eastern and midland regions. There are approximately 160,000 women in the target age group in these regions and since the programme commenced more than 1,600 cancers have been detected.</P>
        <P>Planning is under way for the roll out of the programme to the remaining regions. There are approximately 130,000 women in the target population for screening in the southern and western regions. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of the roll-out will be met. On full roll-out, women in the 50 to 64 age group in every county will have access to breast screening and follow-up treatment where appropriate.</P>
        <P>When the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered at national level, <Col N="181"/>consideration will be given to including older women, thereby continuing the screening of women in the programme who have reached 65 years of age. There is no evidence of the value of population based breast screening programmes for women under 50 years of age and there are no plans to extend the programme to this age group.</P>
        <P>Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>the steps she is taking to provide affordable residential care for older persons, particularly taking into account the aging of the population (details supplied).</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and I regard supporting older people to stay in their own homes and communities as a key policy priority, thereby moving away from the practice of placing people in residential care as a first option. Research has shown this is the expressed wish of the majority of our older people.</P>
        <P>Additional funding has been allocated for services for older people and palliative care amounting to &euro;150 million in the budget for 2006 &mdash;&euro;110 million for 2006 and &euro;40 million more for 2007. The investment package is a major step in focusing new resources on home care first and foremost, while still supporting appropriate residential care.</P>
        <P>For those who do require residential care, the nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 on foot of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, and regulations made thereunder to give some financial assistance towards the cost of private nursing home care. It was never intended that the scheme would subsidise the full costs of private nursing home care.</P>
        <P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are currently three rates of subvention payable, &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum.</P>
        <P>The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, sub<Col N="183"/>ject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. Additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the nursing home subvention scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to &euro;160 million.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, established a working group to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. The report of that working group on the future financing of long-term care has been presented to Government and is currently being considered by Cabinet.</P>

	<P>Staff in the official agencies contracted by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland carry out checks on traceability and labelling on a routine basis or as required; however, during the period in question no such checks were carried out. In 2006, the authority proposes to conduct a series of such checks on various sectors of the food industry in conjunction with its official agencies. The results of these audits will be published and where a deliberate intention to mislead the consumer is identified, enforcement action will be taken against the food businesses concerned.</P>
        <P>The official agencies contracted by the FSAI for the purposes of labelling and traceability are the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Health Service Executive and the local authorities. Approximately 880 whole-time equivalent staff are available to those agencies for food control purposes and the FSAI has allocated approximately &euro;600,000 for control inspections in 2006.</P>
        <P>The audit of the 90 food premises in question was conducted by the authority&rsquo;s chief audit manager and three audit managers. In addition to the salary costs of these personnel, travelling and subsistence costs for the purposes of the audit amounted to approximately &euro;16,000. There were also some testing costs for which a separate figure is not available, as these costs are included in the general costs of testing.</P>
        <P>Following this audit, the FSAI provided each of the official agencies with a copy of the report on those premises under their supervision which were inspected. The authority has confirmed that follow-up action was taken by way of additional visits and inspections and that the matters which required attention have now been rectified.</P>
        <P>The audit identified a training need in the areas of recall and traceability and labelling. Consequently, the FSAI devised and delivered training sessions to over 500 field staff in its official agencies. The training was designed to allow enforcement officers to gain an understanding of the type of audit carried out, the issues which arose and to enable the enforcement officers to carry out similar labelling, traceability and recall audits on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>It was also evident that there was a need to remind industries of their responsibilities regarding traceability and recall and as a result the FSAI participated in a number of industry seminars dealing specifically with these issues.</P>

	<P>On foot of the recommendations of the pharmacy review group, approval was given in Government decision S180/20/10/0831 of 21 June 2005 to the Department to commence drafting new pharmacy legislation in two pharmacy Bills.</P>
        <P>The first Bill is to deal with fitness to practice provisions for pharmacists, the removal of the prohibition &mdash; the &ldquo;derogation&rdquo;&mdash; on non-Irish graduates being supervising pharmacists in pharmacies less than three years old, and a stronger statutory basis for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.</P>
        <P>The second Bill will address the regulation of pharmacy and pharmacy services, including the definition of pharmacy services and a community pharmacy, enhanced provisions for the inspection of pharmacies, the provision for regulation of pharmacies for matters such as physical conditions, standards, record keeping and promotional activities. It is also proposed to deal with general provisions relating to community pharmacy contracts for services, as well as the remaining recommendations of the pharmacy review group.</P>
        <P>The Government accepted the review group recommendation that there should be no beneficial ownership or business interest of any kind between prescribing and dispensing and, in regard to multi-GP practices with adjacent pharmacies, that contracted pharmacies and general practices should occupy discrete premises, with separate entrances. I have agreed to consider the potential conflict of interest issues arising from the development of health centres with adjacent contracted pharmacies and this issue will be addressed in the second Bill in the light of that examination.</P>
        <P>In the interim, the Department has advised the Health Service Executive to take due care in assessing pharmacy contract applications in order that any commercial relationship between a pharmacy contractor and a health centre will not affect the proper provision of services as required under clauses 21, 22(3), 22(4) and 23 of the phar<Col N="192"/>macy contract, dealing with ownership of pharmacies and beneficial interest. I have also written to the Medical Council on this issue.</P>
        <P>The location of services is a land use planning issue and, therefore, a matter for the relevant planning authority. I am not in a position to dictate the location of privately funded and owned pharmacies or GP practices, nor to restrict the awarding of State pharmacy contracts based on location.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;150 million was allocated to services for older people-palliative care in the 2006 budget. Of this, an extra &euro;33 million was allocated to the home help service, &euro;30 million of which is provided for 2006 and will deliver 1.75 million home help hours. A total of &euro;55 million was also allocated to home care packages &mdash;&euro;30 million for 2006 and a further &euro;25 million for 2007, with an additional 2,000 packages to be delivered by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Home care, including the home help service, is delivered through the HSE in partnership with a range of providers, including the Health Service Executive itself, voluntary groups and the private sector. This has long since been a policy on home care and there are no plans to privatise the home help service or give priority to private companies over public or other home care providers. The most important factor in delivering home care and home help is not who provides the service, but that an appropriate level of service is delivered in as flexible a manner as possible which is highly responsive to the real needs of the individual. There is no reason private providers should not work in partnership with the HSE to this end, as they have been doing in the past and will continue to do.</P>
        <P>Allocation of funding between providers is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, the Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to issue a reply to the Deputy with relevant information in order to demonstrate that there are already examples of <Col N="193"/>service providers from the voluntary and private sectors delivering home care.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In accordance with the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive must submit a national service plan to me for approval each year. The service plan must include reference to the type and volume of services to be provided in the year. It is imperative that the service plan is compiled with due regard to services being delivered in line with the funding provided in the published Estimates volume. Approval of the service plan is subject to, among other matters, compliance with policies regarding service delivery with approved levels of funding. In conjunction with the compilation of the service plan is the requirement for the HSE, under the Health Act 2004, to produce an annual report. The 2005 annual report is expected shortly.</P>
        <P>In terms of performance review of our acute hospital sector, some 37 hospitals participate in the Casemix system. It accounts for 1.7 million patients, excluding outpatients, and almost &euro;3.5 billion of costs. It is widely agreed that the most developed system for assessing comparative efficiency, creating incentives within the acute hospital sector and encouraging good performance is Casemix.</P>
        <P>Ireland was the second country in Europe to adopt Casemix which has been used here as part of the acute hospital annual budgeting process since 1993. The programme is expanded incrementally each year. Within the next 18 months, for the 2008 financial allocations, using 2006 cost and activity data, 50% of the budget related to direct patient care, in Casemix hospitals, will be peer group performance related.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 199 to 204 inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit disorder-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was considered by the working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services which reported in 2001. All aspects of the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and management of children suffering from ADD-ADHD were considered by the working group in the course of its deliberations. In its report, the group recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric services as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with ADD-ADHD.</P>
        <P>This has been a priority for the Department in recent years. Since 1997, additional funding of in excess of &euro;20 million has been provided to allow for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. This has resulted in the funding of a further 23 child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists. Nationally, there are now 56 such psychiatrists employed.</P>
        <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including services for children and adults with ADD-ADHD, was considered in the context of the work of the expert group on mental health policy. The Government published the group&rsquo;s report, A Vision for Change, on Tuesday, 24 January.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change contains wide-ranging recommendations for the further development of mental health services for both children and adults, including substantial increases in the numbers of consultant-led community mental health teams. These teams, when in place, will provide specialist care for all those with mental illness, including persons with ADD-ADHD. The Government has accepted the expert group&rsquo;s report as the basis for the future development of the mental health services.</P>

	<P>The common list of reimbursable drugs and medicines for the general medical services and drug payment schemes is reviewed and amended monthly, as new products become available and deletions are notified. For an item <Col N="197"/>to be included in the list, it must comply with published criteria, including authorisation status as appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product. In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. Ritalin is included in the common list of reimbursable drugs and medicines.</P>

	<P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the assessment of initial applications for medical cards and the review-renewal of existing cards.</P>
        <P>Reviews of eligibility of medical card holders are necessary to ensure that the HSE&rsquo;s medical card database is accurate and public accountability issues are addressed. The periodic review of eligibility and the frequency of such reviews are matters for the HSE to consider and determine. The HSE takes into account the particular circumstances of each case when setting renewal dates.</P>
        <P>Among the aims of the HSE&rsquo;s schemes modernisation project is to standardise business processes and their implementation across the HSE in respect of the general medical services and related schemes to ensure a system which is fair, patient-centred and transparent and at the same time provides proper governance. In this regard, the HSE has prepared and is now implementing operational guidelines which cover a number of areas relevant to the medical card assessment process, including setting renewal dates. This includes the appropriate approach to review dates for people with chronic illnesses and conditions.</P>
        <P>The Department has asked the HSE to keep its procedures in this area under review to ensure they achieve the appropriate balance between <Col N="198"/>recognising the circumstances of medical card holders and meeting public accountability and governance requirements.</P>

	<P>I am fully committed to the national roll out of a cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. My Department has requested the Health Service Executive to prepare a detailed implementation plan for a national programme. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call and recall programme <i>via</i> effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money. All elements of the programme, call and recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</P>
        <P>Significant preparatory work is well under way, involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register. I made an additional &euro;9 million available to the executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for the roll out.</P>
        <P>I consider that the programme would be best rolled out in the primary care setting, subject to affordable and acceptable arrangements being agreed. A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision by general practitioners of publicly-funded primary care services is being conducted at present, under the auspices of the labour relations commission. I have requested that the general practitioner elements of a national cervical screening programme be tabled at these discussions. Any remuneration arrangements agreed must be capable of delivering a high uptake among women. Payments must be primarily based on reaching acceptable targets.</P>
        <P>We must also have tailored initiatives in place to encourage take up among disadvantaged and difficult to reach groups. I wish to see the programme rolled out as quickly as possible but only when the essential infrastructure, organisation and services are in place, are quality assured and meet international standards.</P>

	<P>Additional funding of &euro;150 million was allocated to services for older people and palliative care in the 2006 budget. Of this, an extra &euro;33 million was allocated to the home help service, &euro;30 million of which is provided for 2006 and will deliver 1.75 million home help hours. A sum of &euro;55 million was also allo<Col N="208"/>cated to home care packages, &euro;30 million for 2006 and a further &euro;25 million for 2007, with an additional 2,000 packages to be delivered by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Home care, including the home help service, is delivered through the Health Service Executive, in partnership with a range of providers including the executive, voluntary groups and the private sector. This has long been a policy with regard to home care and there are no plans to privatise the home help service or give priority to private companies over public or other home care providers. The most important factor in delivering home care and home help is not who provides the service, but that an appropriate level of service is delivered in a flexible manner which is highly responsive to the needs of the individual. There is no reason private providers should not continue to work in partnership with the HSE to this end, as they have done in the past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 236 together.</P>
        <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including services for persons with eating disorders, were considered in the context of the work of the expert group on mental health policy. The group&rsquo;s report, entitled A Vision for Change, was published on 24 January 2006.</P>
        <P>In its report, the expert group noted that epidemiological data from other jurisdictions suggest an annual incidence of ten cases of anorexia nervosa per 100,000 females and of 0.5 for males. The ratio of anorexia nervosa to bulimia nervosa is usually given as four to one. Both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa come within the remit of the mental health services. In this regard, an additional &euro;25 million was made available this year to the HSE for the future development of our mental health services.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change acknowledges gaps in the current provision of mental health services for persons with eating disorders. At present, there <Col N="210"/>are three designated specialist beds for the treatment of eating disorders in the public mental health service and two eight bed units in the private sector. The two private services, while mainly catering for private patients, also take public patients paid for by the HSE.</P>
        <P>Recommendations made by the expert group regarding services for persons with eating disorders include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders, the further development of primary and community care services and the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a national centre for eating disorders. The Government has accepted the expert group&rsquo;s report as the basis for the future development of the mental health services.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive, which has primary responsibility for implementing the recommendations of A Vision for Change is in the process of establishing an implementation group to ensure that the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner. I have recently appointed an independent monitoring group, as recommended in the report, to oversee the implementation of A Vision for Change. This group will hold its inaugural meeting shortly.</P>
        <P>Elements of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions which relate to a specific case concern the management and delivery of services which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, the Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to have this matter investigated and to issue a reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the determination of eligibility of applicants for medical cards and general practitioner visit cards is, statutorily, a matter for the Health Service Executive. Under section 45 of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the executive, are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Section 58 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, provides for general practitioner visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
        <P>National guidelines in respect of the assessment of medical card applications are in use by the HSE. These ensure that not only the income aspects of a person&rsquo;s circumstances but also any medical condition which may involve significant costs for the individual or family concerned, are taken into account in determining eligibility.</P>
        <P>In 2005 I made significant improvements to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and general practitioner visit cards is assessed. The income guidelines used in assessing applications are now 29% higher than they were at the end of 2004. The assessment is now based on an <Col N="212"/>applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. This is much fairer to applicants. The income assessment guidelines based for general practitioner visit cards are 25% higher than those used for medical cards. The HSE has publicised these changes through a number of measures, including a national advertising campaign and has made the application process as simple as possible.</P>

	<P>The community welfare service of the Health Service Executive administers the supplementary welfare scheme on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to a recent decision to transfer this scheme, together with associated resources, to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. This decision means that the staff concerned will transfer from the Health Service Executive to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It is not intended to replace the community welfare officer with officers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs but rather that community welfare officers will become part and parcel of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>The background to this decision is that the commission on financial management and control systems in the health service noted in the Brennan report that the health system had been assigned responsibility for a number of non-core health activities. It recommended that the Government consider assigning non-core activities currently undertaken by agencies within the health service to other bodies.</P>
        <P>The Government subsequently decided to ask an interdepartmental group to examine this issue. The report of the interdepartmental group, entitled The Core Functions of the Health Service, was submitted to, and accepted by, the Government recently. The report recommends <Col N="215"/>that income support and maintenance schemes administered by the HSE, together with associated resources, should be transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>This particular initiative has been mooted several times in the past, by the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 and by the Review of Supplementary Welfare Allowances by the Combat Poverty Agency in 1991. I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision as it provides an opportunity to streamline the activities of the HSE, while bringing about positive change for social welfare customers.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental working group is being established to progress implementation of the transfer. Administrative and industrial relations issues must be resolved as part of the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s decision and the HSE has already been in touch with the health service unions in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am confident, as is my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, that this transfer process can be carried out without any negative effect on the standard of service currently provided by community welfare officers or in the important role that they play in addressing issues of disadvantage in the community.</P>

	<P>The charging for long-stay care under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 is implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005. These regulations were signed on 14 June 2005. They reinstated charges for inpatient services and provided for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. The regulations were prepared following extensive consultation with the HSE and others.</P>
        <P>Section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for levying a charge where inpatient services are provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months. In this regard, charging patients in long-term care commenced on 14 July 2005, which was after the expiration of 30 days after the regulations were signed. The regulations, in keeping with section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.</P>
        <P>Class 1 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis. A weekly charge of either &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser, can be levied. <Col N="219"/>Class 2 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24-hour basis. A weekly charge of &euro;90 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser, can be levied. These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004. It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied. The Deputy&rsquo;s question involves the management and delivery of health and personal social services which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I have not issued a directive to the Health Service Executive, HSE, to deal with physical assaults on the nursing profession. However, I am aware that the HSE recently established a working group to examine issues of this nature regarding all health care staff. My Department is represented on this group which aims to develop national policies for the health services on staff training, support structures, risk assessment, prevention of assaults and dealing with offenders who attack staff. Responsibility for the safety of staff rests with the HSE and other publicly funded health agencies who, as employers, must meet their obligations in this regard. The safety and security of all health care staff is of paramount importance and it is imperative that all appropriate measures should be utilised to protect staff, especially those working in circumstances which by the nature of the service being provided make them more vulnerable.</P>

The place where the deceased is interred is not one of the particulars required to register a death.

As this is a matter for the executive under the Health Act 2004, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have it investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive collective agreement between health employers and SIPTU was finalised in 2000 regarding the terms and conditions for employment of home helps. This agreement provided for a significant improvement in the pay and conditions of employment for home helps. Home helps are paid in accordance with the agreed pay scale, &euro;25,590 to &euro;28,451 per annum, or <i>pro rata</i> thereof for part-time staff. Home helps receive the benefits of all social partnership pay increases together with special increases under benchmarking. In addition, home helps receive the same benefits as all other staff in the health services which include premia pay, paid annual leave and paid sick leave.</P>
        <P>I am aware that a high level group has been established, with representatives from the Health Service Executive and staff representatives from SIPTU and IMPACT, to address issues pertaining to the standardisation of home help services. The group held its first meeting on 23 March last and further meetings are scheduled. An additional &euro;33 million full year cost was allocated to the home help programme in budget 2006, &euro;30 million of which will be for 2006 with the remaining &euro;3 million for 2007, which will enable the Health Service Executive to provide an additional 1.75 million hours nationally in 2006. The additional resource will further enhance the service and facilitate the expressed wish of many more older people to continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>

	<P>The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2006 outlines the amount of funding available to the Health Vote group for the 2005 and the estimate for 2006. The gross total, including capital, available to my Department and the Health Service Executive in 2005 was &euro;11,872.218 million. The Office of the Minister for Children under the Minister of State with responsibility for children was established in 2006 and is now included in the Health Vote group. Therefore, the estimated gross total, including capital, for my Department, the HSE and the OMC in the current year is &euro;13,816.146 million.</P>
        <P>The casemix budget model outturns generated in December 2005, based on 2004 activity and costs, for inclusion as part of the 2006 financial allocations for the 37 hospitals involved in the national programme, have been passed to the HSE and have been issued to each hospital involved. It is agreed between my Department and the HSE that casemix will continue to be used as a central pillar in acute hospital funding policy and the incremental broadening of the programme, as set out in my Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy, will be a critical issue in its development.</P>

	<P>Tackling the current difficulties with accident and emergency departments is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health. The service provided to some patients in accident and emergency departments is unacceptable and must be improved. Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in accident and emergency departments and do not require admission. I believe that there is a need to build on the accident and emergency action plan and arising from discussions with the Health Service Executive, a number of proposals have been agreed, including the setting of performance targets for individual hospitals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE has developed and circulated a framework for improving accident and emergency services, setting out clearly the proposed approach. The recently established dedicated task force will oversee the implementation of this framework. The task force includes accident and emergency consultants, a consultant geriatrician, a respiratory physician, a director of nursing, and a hospital chief executive, as well as full-time representatives from the national hospitals office and primary, community and continuing care services. The task force supports individual hospitals in identifying specific problems and addressing them, and working with hospitals to introduce a system of &ldquo;whole hospital&rdquo; performance measures to improve the patient&rsquo;s journey not alone through the accident and emergency department but through the hospital system from admission to discharge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share the view that has been expressed by the chief executive of the HSE that the achievement of improvements in accident and emergency services is dependent on fundamental changes in hospitals and in other areas of the health service. I am confident that by improving hospital processes and procedures, by providing additional step-down beds for those patients who do not require acute hospital care, and by expanding and enhancing primary and community care services we can achieve a sustained improvement in our accident and emergency services.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, additional funding of &euro;150 million was allocated to services for older people and palliative care in the 2006 budget. Of this, an extra &euro;33 million was allocated to the home help service, &euro;30 million of which is provided for 2006 to deliver 1.75 million home help hours. A total of &euro;55 million was also allocated to home care packages, &euro;30 million for 2006 and a further &euro;25 million for 2007, with an additional 2,000 packages to be delivered by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Home care packages may consist of a mixture of grants, contracted care services, therapeutic input and equipment and other such community services to facilitate the older person to remain living in his or her own home. These packages are tailored to the needs of the individual and may or may not consist of a grant paid directly to the person. The packages are based on the level of need as well as the financial circumstances of the applicant. Therefore, the type and amount of the package a person receives can vary from one individual to another.</P>
        <P>Home care, including the home help service, is delivered through the HSE in partnership with a range of providers including the Health Service Executive itself, voluntary groups and the private sector. This has long since been a policy regarding home care and there are no plans to privatise the home help service or give priority to private companies over public or other home care providers.</P>
        <P>The most important factor in delivering home care and home help is not who provides the service, but that an appropriate level of service is delivered in as flexible a manner as possible which is highly responsive to the real needs of the individual, and there is no reason private providers should not work in partnership with the HSE to this end, as they have been doing in the past and will continue to do.</P>

	<P>While the figures provided by the HSE indicate a reduction in the number of home help hours between 2003 and 2005, the HSE has advised that the reduced service levels were due to the demands on the service beyond the available budget allocation.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, additional funding of &euro;150 million was allocated to services for older people and palliative care in the 2006 budget. This is a full year cost, &euro;110 million of which is for 2006 with the remaining &euro;40 million for 2007. This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people and the package has a strong focus on community based supports. Of this investment, an extra &euro;33 million, full year cost, was allocated to the home help service. Of this total, a sum of &euro;30 million is provided for 2006 and will deliver approximately 1.75 million additional home help hours. Therefore, I see no reason that the home help service should not show a significant improvement on a national scale.</P>

        <P FLI="0">On 24 February 1998 the Government agreed that matters of Departments availing of outside legal services, and a mechanism for providing a dedicated legal adviser in certain Departments should be discussed further between the Office of the Attorney General and relevant Departments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 289 together.</P>
        <P>The position is that section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a tax deduction at the individual&rsquo;s highest rate of tax in respect of the costs incurred by an individual of employing another person, including a person whose services are provided by or through an agency, to take care of him or her, a spouse or a relative who, throughout the relevant tax year, is totally incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity. The amount of the tax deduction is &euro;50,000 for the 2006 tax year, &euro;30,000 for previous tax years, or, if lower, the actual amount expended in the relevant tax year in employing the person.</P>
        <P>The key to this tax relief is that the person incurring the cost of the care employs the carer either directly or, where the employed carer is provided by or through an agency, the agency employs and pays the carer directly. The employment of a carer relief is not available where the carer is self-employed for tax purposes. However, for this purpose, the question of whether an employment relationship exists depends on the circumstances of an individual case and not necessarily on any assertion by an individual carer as to their status.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, tax relief may also be due under the heading of health expenses under section 469 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 regarding care provided in a nursing home. In addition, health expenses relief may also be due in cases of serious illness where qualified nurses are engaged on the advice of a medical practitioner to provide constant nursing care in the patient&rsquo;s home. In such a case, tax relief will be allowed where a medical certificate is provided which shows the nature of the patient&rsquo;s illness; states that constant nursing care by fully-qualified nurses in the patient&rsquo;s home is required; and covers the full period for which home nursing is being claimed, and the nurses providing the nursing care are fully qualified and their full names, addresses and qualifications have been supplied.</P>
        <P>In a separate reply, the Minister for Health and Children has dealt with those aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s question concerned with care services provided by the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>The matter raised by the Deputy was referred to Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, which has statutory responsibility for the provision of a national map<Col N="232"/>ping service in the State under the Ordnance Survey Ireland Act 2001. Under section 29 of the Act, OSI may make such charges as it considers necessary and appropriate in consideration of the performance by it of its functions; the provision by it of any service and the carrying on by it of any activities.</P>
        <P>In the context of the current year revenues which OSI anticipates from its commercial activities, and the total costs incurred by the organisation in the exercise of its statutory functions, there is an expected cost recovery rate of 75% approximately. The mapping product referred to by the Deputy is in respect of urban mapping which is revised by OSI on an annual basis and maintained in a digital format using the latest mapping technologies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having regard to the costs associated with building and land development generally, the charges in respect of mapping information supplied by OSI represents in relative terms, a small proportion of the overall costs. Between January 2003 and the present date, the mapping product referred to by the Deputy increased in price by &euro;2.37 to its present cost of &euro;37.18, or an annual average increase of around 2.2%.</P>

        <P>The 2006 Finance Act provides for the termination of a range of area-based tax incentive renewal schemes, in line with my budget day announcement to this effect.

        <P>Against this background, I have no plans at present to introduce new tax incentive schemes of the sort referred to by the Deputies. However, the possibility of using tax incentivisation as a tool of economic policy will continue to be borne in mind in framing future tax policy, in accordance with the consultants&rsquo; recommendations. It should also be noted that the introduction of new area-based incentive schemes would raise issues of compatibility with EU state aid law.</P>

	<P>The Revenue Commissioners advise me they are aware of the growing customer service pressures in some of their public offices. The additional pressures are due to an increased number of customers, an increasing number of customers who have more than one employment and the number of customers who do not have English as their first language.</P>
        <P>In response to these pressures and to improve customer service standards, the Revenue Commissioners have deployed additional staff in their public offices. They will shortly provide translations of the most commonly used explanatory leaflets and forms in a number of international languages, including Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Czech and Slovakian. I also understand that the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; main public office, in Dublin&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Connell Street, will undergo a major expansion and the new facilities will be available by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners provide a range of contact options for customers which reduce the need for personal visits to the tax offices to access information on tax matters. They have put in place a number of self-service channels for customers that allow them to request forms and leaflets or claim certain amendments to their tax credit certificate without the need for direct contact with a staff member. This can be done using touch-tone telephone, text messaging or the Internet. Later this year the Revenue Commissioners will introduce a more extensive suite of on-line and telephony services for PAYE taxpayers. These initiatives will facilitate PAYE taxpayers in &ldquo;self-managing&rdquo; their tax affairs, including adjusting their tax credit certificates to reflect their current entitlements, and requesting balancing statements. The Revenue Commissioners are confident that the measures to be put in place will lead to a greatly improved service for all its customers, including a reduction in queuing time at its public offices.</P>

	<P>Open transparent competition has long been a fundamental principle of the public procurement regime and this is totally in accord with the State&rsquo;s competition policy. Furthermore, the national public procurement policy framework, published by my Department in 2005, indicates that competition is a necessary part of the public tendering process. Competition is also facilitated via the national public procurement website <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>. The website is a central resource where all significant public sector contracts are advertised and is now the principal reference point for companies, large and small, interested in doing business with the public sector. This facility increases transparency and greatly increases access to, and competition for, public sector contracts. The small and medium enterprise sector is actively targeted through a marketing campaign. There has been an extremely good response to this initiative which has resulted in a steady increase in the <Col N="236"/>number of registered suppliers competing for business. Registered suppliers receive free email alerts to tender notices of interest to them.</P>
        <P>The public procurement guidelines issued by my Department recommend that contracting authorities ensure that recently established firms, or firms with no previous experience of public contracts, are not excluded from invitations to tender. The guidelines further recommend that contracting authorities should encourage these firms, such as by allowing them to tender for smaller contracts initially and then, subject to satisfactory performance, progressing to larger or more complex contracts. However, in awarding public contracts, contracting authorities must be satisfied that the successful tenderer has the capacity, including the financial capacity, to perform the contract. Evidence of financial standing may be sought by various means and contracting authorities have flexibility on this requirement. The level of capacity must be proportionate and relevant to the size of the contract. Smaller contracts do not have onerous or prohibitive requirements and I am not aware of difficulties in this area. I am satisfied that public procurement policy and guidelines promote an appropriate balance of competition and business opportunity for suppliers and service providers of all sizes.</P>

These visits are also important for enhancing our links with Irish communities abroad to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the valuable work of Irish community and friendship groups.</P>
        <P>I visited Australia from 11 to 19 March 2006 as part of the Government&rsquo;s structured programme of ministerial visits abroad for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day to engage with the Irish community and to promote modern Ireland overseas, in particular, the attractiveness of Ireland as a market for inward investment across a range of sectors. My seven-day programme contained a balance of Irish community and business events. I used each occasion to showcase Ireland as a world class economy and tourism destination and in my speeches I referred specifically to the &ldquo;Irish advantage&rdquo; that has contributed to our economic success and to the promotion of Ireland as a knowledge economy, particularly the building up of our research capacity and capability, which has underpinned much <Col N="237"/>of our economic performance over the last decade.</P>

	<P>Where an SSIA account matures, either on death or at the end of the five-year period, tax at 23% is liable on the income earned from the investment of both the subscriptions and the Exchequer tax credits. For an SSIA account to mature, the account holder must be resident in the State when the SSIA account commenced and be either resident or ordinarily resident in the State for the duration of their SSIA account. Where the individual does not qualify under these residency conditions the individual is required to close the account and the aggregate value of all the assets in the account at time of cessation is liable to tax at 23%.</P>
        <P>A person is regarded as resident in the State if he or she has spent 183 days in the State in a calendar year or leaves the State early in the year but has spent more than 30 days in the State in that year and between that year and the previous year has spent a total of at least 280 days in the State. A person is deemed to be ordinarily resident in the State for each of the three years after the year in which he or she was last resident in the State, where he or she was resident in the State for three consecutive years prior to leaving.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that any taxpayer has a right to seek a review of Revenue&rsquo;s handling of his or her tax or customs affairs, or of a decision made by a Revenue official. The right is specifically recognised in Revenue&rsquo;s customer service charter. In the majority of cases, a senior Revenue official in the <Col N="239"/>taxpayer&rsquo;s local Revenue office carries out the review. The review is commenced as soon as a request is received.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners state that normally the best and quickest way to resolve most customer service complaints is to contact the Revenue office dealing with the person&rsquo;s tax affairs by phone, letter, email or personal contact. A Revenue staff member will try to resolve the complaint without delay. However, if the staff member cannot resolve the complaint, or if the person is unhappy with the response, he or she may ask that the local manager reviews the matter. If the person is still unhappy, he or she can have their complaint referred to the customer service manager in the relevant region or division. Contact details are available on the revenue website, <i>www.revenue.ie/aboutus</i>.</P>
        <P>If the matter still cannot be resolved the taxpayer may have their case reviewed either internally by a senior Revenue officer outside the region or by an external reviewer acting in conjunction with a senior Revenue officer. Over the years the procedures have operated successfully in a wide range of issues. Details of how to avail of Revenue&rsquo;s customer service complaints procedures are set out in Revenue leaflet CS4 which is available on <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A taxpayer aggrieved by an assessment to income tax or corporation tax or by a determination of the Revenue Commissioners regarding these taxes has a right of appeal against an assessment or determination. The appeal must be lodged, in writing, with the regional Revenue office dealing with the taxpayer&rsquo;s tax affairs, within 30 days of the assessment or determination issuing. If the matter is not subsequently settled by agreement between the local manager and the taxpayer, the appeal will eventually be heard and adjudicated upon by the appeal commissioner. If the taxpayer is not satisfied with the ruling of the appeal commissioner, the appeal may be reheard by a Circuit Court judge and be referred to the High Court and the Supreme Court, on a point of law.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the case referred to by the Deputy, a return of income for 2004 was received on 23 January 2006 and this was dealt with when a PAYE balancing statement issued to the taxpayer on 1 February 2006 showing an underpayment of &euro;23.46. The claim made for a refund of tuition fees amounting <Col N="240"/>to &euro;2,042.50 was not granted as insufficient information had been provided on the return of income. The taxpayer supplied additional information on 7 February 2006. This was examined, and a further letter issued from Revenue on 10 March 2006 seeking the following additional information: whether the course is an undergraduate or postgraduate course; if any portion of the fees will be refunded to the person from any source such as by his employer or by way of grant or scholarship; and details of where previously conferred with a certificate, diploma or degree in respect of an undergraduate course of more than two years duration.</P>
        <P>This information is still required to finalise the claim made for a refund of tuition fees and the taxpayer should now arrange to send this to Ms Marion McBride, Dublin South County District, Revenue Commissioners, The Plaza Complex, Tallaght, Dublin 24 where it will be dealt with on receipt. The Revenue letter that issued on 10 March 2006 was generated from the computer system and should have contained the name of the district manager and the 1890 telephone number. If these were omitted, the Revenue Commissioners apologise for any inconvenience caused to the taxpayer.</P>

The figures for 2004 and 2005 include corporation tax yield from IFSC companies whose activities were previously taxable at 10%, now taxable at the standard rate of corporation tax. Other tax remitted by the IFSC, such as PAYE, DIRT on deposit interest and stamp duties on credit cards, ATM cards and cheques, are not included in the figures given, since the tax liability is not on the institutions themselves.</P>

Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s son or daughter purchases a second-hand house the only relief available to him or her is as a first-time buyer and owner occupier, if applicable. This would entitle him or her to exemption of stamp duty on the purchase deed of transfer for any property up to &euro;317,500. A reduced rate of stamp duty would apply where the purchase price is between &euro;317,501 and &euro;635,000 as outlined under heading &ldquo;B &mdash; First time Buyer/Owner Occupier&rdquo; in the table. If he or she subsequently incurs and carries out renovation work on the property there will be no stamp duty implications on the cost of renovation.</P>
        <P>If the property purchased is a new house, where it is subject to a floor area compliance certificate under 125 sq m, an exemption to stamp duty will apply to an owner-occupier. A relief for owner-occupier is also available on new houses where the floor area exceeds 125 sq m. Stamp duty then becomes payable on the greater of the site value or on 25% of the total purchase price.

	<P>Charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU sixth VAT directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially, only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P>
        <P>Ministerial orders have been used in a limited way to provide refunds of VAT on certain aids and appliances for the disabled and on medical equipment donated voluntarily to hospitals. These orders are focused and are designed to target specific circumstances. However, under EU law, it would not be possible to introduce new schemes within the VAT Act 1972 to relieve charities from the obligation to pay VAT on goods and services that they purchase.</P>
        <P>The tax code provides exemption for charities from income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, deposit interest retention tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty, probate tax and dividend withholding tax. Moreover, charities also benefit significantly from the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations, which was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and which, for the first time, allowed tax relief on personal donations to domestic charities and other approved bodies. The relief is based on the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal rate which for an individual donor could be as high as <Col N="244"/>42% and, in the case of donations from the PAYE sector, is given directly to the charities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Investments under the National Development Plan &mdash; NDP &mdash; 2000-2006 are delivered through a number of operational programmes which are directly managed and implemented by Departments, the regional assemblies or other agencies. Each operational programme has a monitoring committee which meets twice yearly to monitor the ongoing implementation of the programme. The managing authorities and the Departments or agencies responsible for implementing specific aspects of the operational programmes have additional procedures in place to monitor and manage the ongoing implementation of the programmes.</P>
        <P>The responsibility of my Department is to ensure that funds are made available and allocated in a manner that achieves a sustainable match between spending and resources to meet the Government&rsquo;s objectives and to secure full drawdown of Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of structural funds. In this regard, I have written to my ministerial colleagues asking them to ensure that the investment objectives for the Border, midland and western, BMW, region are appropriately prioritised to ensure a better regional spread of expenditure that will go to achieving the overall aims of the NDP. The most recent monitoring data reported to my Department indicate that, in total, &euro;12 billion was expended in the BMW region under the plan over the period January 2000 to end-December 2005. This represents 76% of total profiled expenditure for the corresponding period.</P>
        <P>As well as monitoring the individual operational programmes, my Department chairs the overarching NDP-CSF monitoring committee which meets at least twice yearly. This committee monitors overall progress on the plan and will meet on 25 May 2006, at which stage it will have considered the progress reports of the individual operational programmes for the period January 2000 to end-December 2005.</P>

        <Quest>the reason the widowed parent tax credit ceases after five years; his plans to extend the relief; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The widowed parent tax credit, which applies on a sliding scale for the first five years after the year of bereavement, is intended as transitional relief to help such parents cope financially with the change from married to widowed status. It was never intended to apply for an indefinite period. Prior to 1998, the relief, then an allowance, applied for a period of three years after the year of bereavement. It was extended to apply for a period of five years in the budget and Finance Bill 1998.</P>
        <P>Compared with the generality of taxpayers, widowed parents are treated favourably by the income tax code. In the year of bereavement, a widowed person may receive a personal tax credit of &euro;3,260, which is equivalent in value to the married person&rsquo;s tax credit. Following the year of bereavement, a widowed parent with a qualifying child or children may qualify for the one-parent family tax credit of &euro;1,630 in addition to the personal tax credit of &euro;1,630. In addition, the widowed parent tax credit is available for the five years after the year of bereavement as follows: </P>
        <P LI="1">Year 1 &euro;3,100 </P>
        <P LI="1">Year 2 &euro;2,600 </P>
        <P LI="1">Year 3 &euro;2,100</P>
        <P LI="1">Year 4 &euro;1,600 </P>
        <P LI="1">Year 5 &euro;1,100 </P>
        <P FLI="0">These rates were increased to their present levels in budget 2006 having also been increased in budget 2005.</P>
        <P>Therefore, in the first year following bereavement, a widowed parent is entitled to aggregate tax credits of &euro;6,360, comprising a single personal credit of &euro;1,630, a one-parent family credit of &euro;1,630 and a widowed parent credit of &euro;3,100. Besides the tax credits, widowed parents may also be entitled to receive a standard rate band which is &euro;4,000 per year greater in value than the single standard band of &euro;32,000.</P><Col N="247"/>
        <P>I am satisfied that widowed parents receive favourable treatment under the tax code and I have no plans to further alter the structure of the widowed parent tax credit at the present time.</P>

        <Quest>if he will take steps to have the banks of the River Inny, opposite Ballycroughy, attended to as the area adjacent to the said River Inny, known as the Matt Road, is completely covered with bushes and briars, making it impossible for cattle and sheep to pass; if, in this context, same will be cleared up as it is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The Commissioners of Public Works have responsibility, under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, to maintain the River Inny in proper repair and effective condition. This involves the removal of deposits from the river bed avoiding, where possible, any damage to trees, shrubs and groundcover on the banks and bank slopes. In some cases removal of vegetation on the bank is unavoidable. However, for environmental reasons, the removal of vegetation is limited to what is necessary to carry out maintenance.</P>
        <P>The maintenance of the banks and the removal of vegetation growing on them is not the responsibility of the commissioners.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works is on site in three locations along the River Tolka in Dublin city. Works are continuing in the Distillery Road area to complete the last section of the wall on the left bank following the vacation and demolition of the premises which had delayed completion in this area up to now. Work is also ongoing downstream of Annesley Bridge along <Col N="250"/>the right bank of the river on the East Wall Road to remove vegetation and to repoint the wall.</P>
        <P>I understand the city council is awaiting a report from its consultants on whether the wall will require raising in that area. Further decisions will be made in light of that report when received but the OPW will continue to work closely with the city council on the matter.</P>
        <P>Construction of a new flood defence wall upstream of Glasnevin Bridge, behind the Tolka House on the left bank of the river, has almost been completed. Upon completion of these works, the widening of the channel in Griffith Park will be undertaken with the strengthening works to the wall on the right bank immediately downstream of Dean Swift Bridge. A structural survey of adjacent buildings will need to be completed before any works can commence in the area. These works are likely to last throughout the summer months.</P>

        <Quest>the amount of redundancy payment which was exempt from taxation in 1997 and in each year up to 2006.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15189/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under section 203 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, statutory redundancy payments are free of income tax. Statutory redundancy payments amount to two weeks pay per year of service plus a bonus week subject to a maximum payment of &euro;600 per week. This figure was put in place with effect from 1 January 2005. Previously, a maximum payment of &pound;400, equivalent to &euro;507.90, applied from 1 April 2001 and, before that again, an amount of &pound;300, or &euro;380.91, had been in place since the early 1990s. The payments apply to employees in insurable employment between the ages of 16 and 66 with two years&rsquo; continuous service. With the implementation of commitments contained in Sustaining Progress, distinctions on age grounds which existed for the purpose of calculating entitlements have been abolished.</P>
        <P><i>Ex gratia</i> redundancy payments in excess of the statutory redundancy amount may also be free of income tax to the extent that they are covered by tax exemptions or reliefs. Section 201 of the TCA 1997 provides for an exemption from taxation of the higher of the basic exemption or the standard capital superannuation benefit. For payments made between 1 January 1997 and 31 November 1998, the basic exemption is calculated as &pound;6,000, or &euro;7,618, plus &pound;500, or &euro;635, for each full year of service. For payments made between 1 December 1998 and 31 December 2001, the basic exemption is calculated as &pound;8,000, equivalent to &euro;10,158, plus &pound;600, or &euro;762, for each full year of service. As respects payments made after 1 January 2002, the <Col N="251"/>basic exemption is calculated as &euro;10,160 plus &euro;765 for each full year of service.</P>
        <P>In addition, the basic exemption may be increased by an additional amount of up to &euro;10,000 in a case where an individual is not a member of an occupational pension scheme or irrevocably gives up the right to receive a lump sum from such a scheme, or is a member of a such a scheme where the actuarial value of any lump sum entitlement from the scheme is less than &euro;10,000. The additional amount was introduced in the Finance Act 1980 at a value of &pound;4,000, or &euro;5,080, and remained at that level until the end of 2001. Since 2002, the value of the additional amount has been &euro;10,000. Prior to 2002, it was only available in the case of a first redundancy. However, this restriction was eased in the Finance Act 2002 and the additional amount may now be availed of by an individual every ten years.</P>
        <P>The standard capital superannuation benefit, SCSB, generally benefits those with high earnings and long service. It is calculated at 1/15th of the average yearly salary, averaged over the last three years of service, per complete year of service, less any tax free lump sum which is received or receivable under any approved or statutory pension scheme, or which the individual has an option to receive in the future under such a pension scheme. The structure of SCSB has not changed since 1997.</P>
        <P>If an employee is liable to tax on any of his or her <i>ex gratia</i> redundancy payment an additional relief known as &ldquo;top slicing relief&rdquo; may be due. This means that any amount liable to tax is charged, not at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal rate for the year in which the payment is made, but at an average tax rate calculated by reference to the previous three years. Prior to 2005, the average tax rate was calculated by reference to the previous five years. Top slicing relief can only be claimed by way of repayment after the end of the year of assessment.</P>

        <Quest>the enforcement procedures which exist in respect of the obligation on employers to issue a P45 to employees when they leave a job; if his attention has been drawn to a growing number of instances where employers have refused to issue a P45 to employees when they leave their employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a form P45 is required, under PAYE regulations, to be given by an employer to an employee on cessation of employment. This form certifies the employee&rsquo;s pay, tax and PRSI contributions from the start of the tax year to the date of cessation and also certifies that the deductions have been made in accordance with the instructions given by Revenue. If an employee does not get a form P45 when leaving, he or she should ask the employer for one and repeat the request if necessary. If the employer still fails to give the P45, the employee should notify their local Revenue office in writing that they have failed, after several attempts, to get a P45 and the matter will be followed up quickly by Revenue with the employer. Without a P45, an unemployed person will be unable to claim social welfare benefits or a refund of tax during unemployment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Revenue Commissioners state that they are aware of an increase in the number of instances where employers have failed to issue P45s to employees when they leave their employment. However, I understand that most such cases are resolved quickly following intervention by Revenue. Where the problem persists, an employer who fails to issue a P45 may be subject to civil penalties under section 987 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for breach of the PAYE regulations, or may be charged with a Revenue offence under section 1078 of the same Act for failing, without reasonable excuse, to issue a required certificate or notification.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 329 together.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works has agreed to undertake a local catchment flood risk assessment and management study for the Rye river, encompassing the towns of Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock. This will ultimately form part of a catchment flood risk assessment and management study for the entire Liffey catchment, which it is planned to undertake at a later stage. The OPW agreed to prioritise this section of the study at the request of Kildare County Council in light of the existing flood risk and development pressure in the area. Work will commence as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Catchment flood risk assessment and management plans provide a strategic overview of a river catchment and a context within which decisions on the most appropriate measures to manage existing and potential flood risk can be made. It is expected that it would take approximately 18 months to complete such a study of the Rye.</P>
        <P>Kildare County Council is currently continuing with studies under way by ESBI in Leixlip and environs. The content of these studies is a matter for the local authority as they were not undertaken at the behest of OPW. In the context of this arrangement the Commissioners of Public Works will be willing to consider with Kildare County Council whether elements of work recommended by the studies could be regarded with reasonable certainty as likely to be compatible with the recommendations of the Rye CFRAM study. The OPW is willing to consider providing funding to Kildare County Council to carry out such works <Col N="254"/>if they can be shown to be economically and environmentally sustainable.</P>

	<P>My Department does not have a legal adviser of its own. Legal advice to my Department is provided by the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>In the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Revenue solicitor predates the foundation of the State and the Revenue Commissioners Order of 1923. Currently, the office has a staff of 14 solicitors, 16 law clerks and 12 support staff. The Revenue solicitor provides all legal advice and services to the Revenue Commissioners. Names of all serving staff can be provided if required.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works does not retain its own legal advisers but has a service level agreement in place with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office. The OPW also avails of advice from the Office of the Attorney General as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Information Commissioner employ Mason, Hayes and Curran for the purposes of obtaining legal advice as necessary, and in the provision of legal services to the offices for appearances before the High Court and Supreme Court, where required.</P>
        <P>The offices are mindful of the recommendation in the 1997 report of the review group into the law offices of the State that legal advice should be given to the Government only by the Attorney General and his office. However, the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner are statutorily independent of Government. The Ombudsman investigates complaints against Departments and other public bodies and makes recommendations for redress as appropriate; the Information Commissioner reviews decisions of Departments and public bodies in matters relating to the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003. In view of the offices&rsquo; functions and independence, it is appropriate for them not to use the services of the Attorney General, given that he frequently advises Departments on complaints and FOI matters which are the subject of investigation by the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The Valuation Office does not have its own legal adviser. There are no legal advisers in the State Laboratory. The Public Appointments Service does not have its own legal advisers.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments does not have a post of legal adviser. However the office has retained the services of Matheson Ormsby Prentice to provide it with legal advice as required. As the com<Col N="258"/>mission is an independent office it does not consider it appropriate to use the services of the Attorney General for legal advices.</P>

	<P>The television without frontiers directive provides that member states of the European Union may designate certain sporting and cultural events as being of major importance to society and that events so designated should continue to be available on a free television service. It is a matter for each individual member state to decide whether or not to draw up a list.</P>
        <P>In March 2003 the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources made an order designating certain sports events as events of major importance to society for which the right of a qualifying broadcaster to provide coverage on a live or deferred basis should be provided in the public interest. The order was made in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Acts 1999 to 2003 and was designed to ensure that specified events would continue to be available on a free to air and universal basis in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Act 2003 requires me to carry out a review of designated events not later than three years after the passing of the 2003 Act, that is to say not later than April 2006. Following a public consultation process on the matter and detailed consideration of all the circumstances, I have decided to continue the designation of all the events designated in 2003 and not to add any additional events to the list.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Public Service Obligations) Orders, public service obligations have been placed on the ESB <Col N="259"/>regarding the availability of electricity produced using indigenous peat, electricity produced using renewable, sustainable or alternative forms of energy and electricity produced using peaking generation units. The orders provide for the recovery, by way of a levy on final customers, of the additional costs including a reasonable rate of return on the capital represented by such costs, where appropriate, incurred by the ESB in complying with the orders. The levy is estimated, calculated, adjusted, collected, monitored, certified, accounted for and paid in accordance with the provisions of the orders. The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is responsible for the computation of the basis of the amount of levy payable in each year and for the approval of the procedures for the collection and payment of the levy amounts. Information regarding the levy is included on all bills to customers.</P>
        <P>The European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 make provision for suppliers to provide reliable information on all bills and promotional materials sent to customers regarding the contribution of each energy source to the overall fuel mix of the supplier concerned over the preceding year. In addition, the provision of information regarding environmental impact of electricity produced from that fuel mix is required. I am advised by the CER that it is working with the settlement system administrator, SSA, to develop a methodology for the central calculation of the fuel mix of suppliers. In March the CER published a consultation document setting out its proposals for the calculation of the fuel mix for each supplier until the commencement of the single electricity market in July 2007. The CER plans to issue a decision paper shortly following a review of the comments received.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the CER that there has been no cross-subsidisation by wind power of peat generated power under PSO arrangements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the <Col N="260"/>independent regulator. The Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed, open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities.</P>
        <P>In planning the current phase, phase 2, of the MANs programme, a review of the availability of DSL broadband in the regions showed that over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above were not being offered a broadband option by the private sector. These towns were selected for investment under phase 2 of the MANs programme. A number of regional towns, including Ennis and Shannon, already had DSL broadband on offer from the service providers, so priority was given to the provision of essential broadband infrastructure in those towns where none existed.</P>
        <P>Kilrush will have MAN constructed under this phase. Project managers have been appointed and the detailed design stage is now under way. Construction is expected to start over the coming months. The estimated cost of the projects in Kilrush is &euro;1.35 million and the Department will be providing grant aid of 90%. This network should be completed within 12-18 months. Neither Ennis nor Shannon is part of the current roll-out but may be included in further phases subject to the necessary approvals and Exchequer funding being made available.</P>
        <P>Broadband is already available in Ennis and Shannon. The Department&rsquo;s sponsored website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, which facilitates consumers trying to locate broadband service providers in their area, lists 12 internet service providers offering broadband on digital subscriber line, DSL, one company offering it via wireless and 11 satellite broadband providers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336 and 337 together.</P>
        <P>The domestic grants scheme is being rolled out on behalf of my Department by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI. Verification of an installer&rsquo;s qualifications is the responsibility of each applicant but SEI requires that applicants must use installers who have registered with SEI. From quality assurance and safety perspectives, this requirement is critical to the scheme. It is open to any installer to request that they be placed on SEI&rsquo;s list. Installers who wish to register must sign a statement of compliance indicating willingness to comply with directions resulting from any inspections of appliances, willingness to agree to dispute resolution between installers and consumers, and provision of a valid tax clearance certificate. The installer may also provide information on a voluntary basis, including case studies detailing previous installations, customer references and details of training and relevant certification in the installation of renewable technologies. I do not agree that installation of renewable technologies is relatively simple.</P>
        <P>The availability of trained and certified installers is a crucial element of the quality assurance mechanism of the programme and SEI is also working to develop and establish courses for the training and certification of installers. As a first step, SEI and Action Renewables in Northern Ireland are undertaking a joint INTERREG-funded initiative, which provides for the development and delivery of renewable energy installer training courses in the INTERREG region. The first training courses under the programme are already under way. This will provide a platform to support the further development of a national training and certification infrastructure, which will be sufficiently flexible to allow access for existing installers. Once the relevant infrastructure is in place, it is the intention that all installers will avail of certification from a recognised training course or body to remain on the list. I expect industry operators and their representatives to engage in discussion with SEI about the operation of the training schemes and the requisite standards.</P>
        <P>The scheme is being rolled out over a five-year period and it is anticipated that it will support the conversion to renewable energy in over 10,000 homes. It is too early to determine the number of houses that will avail of the grants specifically for solar heating. The programme is designed to stimulate the market for renewable energy products in the domestic sector and is part of a wider policy imperative to increase public awareness and uptake of sustainable energy. Solar energy is an important part of policy development in the built environment and is also assisted through SEI&rsquo;s house of tomorrow programme, which is targeted at housing developers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As a peripheral market on the edge of Europe, Ireland supports the development of an open, transparent and competitive single energy market, which delivers secure supplies of electricity and gas at competitive prices, in the interests of consumers.</P>
        <P>The recent statement by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown, was made in response to a parliamentary question in the House of Commons. Chancellor Brown&rsquo;s stated concerns relate to the absence of sufficient liberalisation and competition in the wider EU market where the UK is increasingly sourcing gas as the North Sea gas fields deplete. In the national context, Ireland is moving towards a fully liberalised gas market, in line with the objective of competition in the interests of the consumer. Measures continue to come on stream to achieve this end. Under provisions outlined in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, currently with this House for consideration, it is proposed to extend the gas market to domestic customer level. This will enable all customers to shop around for their natural gas supplier and the market will be fully contestable. The legislation proposed includes a commencement provision which ensures that the market will be fully open no later than the 1 July 2007 deadline set by EU Directive 2003/55/EC.</P>
        <P>In SI 760/2005, which further implemented national and EU policy on the development of the gas market, provision was made for the legal <Col N="264"/>unbundling of the transmission and distribution system operations of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE. Under the provisions of this statutory instrument, BGE is required to establish a subsidiary company with responsibility for management of the natural gas transmission and distribution grid. This will further facilitate the operation of third party players in the market. The unbundling process is under way.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 and 344 together.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1972, as amended by section 2 of the Broadcasting and <Col N="265"/>Wireless Telegraphy Act 1988, provides the current statutory definition of devices requiring a television licence. It states: &ldquo;Television set means any apparatus for wireless telegraphy capable of receiving and exhibiting television programmes broadcast for general reception (whether or not its use for that purpose is dependent on the use of anything else in conjunction therewith) and any assembly comprising such apparatus and other apparatus.&rdquo; While many people associate the concept of a television set with the traditional box in the corner of their sitting room, the current statutory definition incorporates computers with cards capable of receiving television broadcasts. However, a computer that can access the internet but is not capable of receiving broadcast television programmes does not meet the statutory definition of a television set and, as a consequence, does not require a television licence.</P>
        <P>The issue of whether or not the current statutory definition continues to be germane, given the many technological developments that have occurred since the enactment by the Oireachtas of the Act of 1988, is being examined in the context of development of the legislative proposals that will form the basis of the proposed broadcasting Bill. It is anticipated that these legislative proposals will be published in the coming months.</P>

	<P>I have not had direct discussions with the Marine Institute regarding the provision of salmon counters. The Department wrote recently to the Marine Institute and the Central and regional fisheries boards requesting that they review the current arrangements in respect of the operational, data management and quality assurance issues for the national fish counter management programme. I expect this review to be completed shortly so that an enhanced national management programme will be established, within available resources, to be carried out by the regional fisheries boards in partnership with the Marine Institute in an efficient and cost effective manner.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 270 of 4 April 2006 in which I outlined the smolt tagging programme being operated by the Marine Institute and the Southern Regional Fisheries Board on the River Suir.</P>

<Col N="266"/>        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Southern Regional Fisheries Board has almost 30% of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon production capacity with only 10% of the salmon quota; his views on whether this is equitable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Southern Regional Fisheries Board comprises four of Ireland&rsquo;s largest river systems, namely, the Suir, Nore, Barrow and Munster Blackwater. By size of available habitat alone, the region should produce 30% of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon stock. Unfortunately, the salmon stocks in the rivers of this region are not meeting their conservation limit and are not reaching their full productive potential. The advice of the scientific committee, if it were to be applied in 2006, was that only 1% of the national quota should be allocated to the districts of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board to assist in the recovery of the fishery. However, I am advised that poor water quality in the region is a significant impediment to salmon production and, if not addressed, may reduce the region&rsquo;s ability to fully rebuild the stocks to these levels.</P>
        <P>The National Salmon Commission recommended that national and district total allowable catches and quotas be aligned with the scientific advice in 2007, and considered that the management regime adopted for 2006 should be designed to move toward this. It determined, therefore, that the total allowable commercial catch for the Lismore and Waterford districts of the southern region would be set, on the basis of the recommendations of the NFME, at 9,600 fish or 65% of the 2006 quota. Catch reductions are to be implemented in all regions in 2006, sufficient to ensure the fishery remains within the national conservation limits specified by the standing scientific committee.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced on 24 March that I had decided to adopt the recommendations made to me by the National Salmon Commission for 2006, which involves reductions in the quota available to both commercial fishermen and anglers in 2006. In doing so I have reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fully align with the scientific advice provided on the management of the wild salmon fishery by 2007.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that details of the Government&rsquo;s policy for the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector, which <Col N="267"/>are based on the recommendations contained within the report by Farrell Grant Sparks following their review of the sector, were published last November. The Government has decided that a fundamental restructuring of the sector is required. It considered that this reform would result in a better model for the State&rsquo;s role in the sector, better resource management, more and better involvement of stakeholders, better corporate governance and value for money.</P>
        <P>As the first step in the reform process, the Government has authorised the drafting of a Bill to establish a national inland fisheries authority, which will subsume the executive functions of the Central and regional fisheries boards. The current fisheries boards will be transformed into regional advisory boards. These statutory bodies will focus on regional issues and will be widely consulted on the detailed implementation of the second phase in the restructuring process. I hope to have the legislation necessary for the establishment of the national inland fisheries authority and regional advisory boards enacted by the end of this year. Naturally, this timeframe depends on the complexity of the legislation currently under development and competing priorities in the legislative calendar for 2006.</P>

In addition, the Marine Institute monitors fish health, which involves at least one inspection of each farm annually. Fish are also subject to a sampling and monitoring programme for residues. The Department&rsquo;s engineering staff also carry out inspections of fish farms to monitor the physical aspects of fish farm operations, including location and positioning, navigational lighting <Col N="268"/>and marking, the condition of structures and their impact, if any, on the surrounding area.</P>

	<P>The standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission has indicated that mixed stock fisheries pose particular threats to the status of individual stocks and that fisheries operated in estuaries and rivers are more likely to fulfil national requirements and international obligations. In this context the national fisheries management executive has identified a range of pilot projects to facilitate the exploitation, in a sustainable manner, of the surplus of salmon destined for Irish rivers within the parameters laid down by the precautionary principle. These projects, the feasibility of which is currently being evaluated by the Department in conjunction with the fisheries boards and the Marine Institute, should yield important information about the commercial and recreational fishery to guide policy toward restoring salmon stocks in threatened catchments while permitting the harvest of salmon where stocks are abundant.</P>

	<P>There are no plans for ministerial or State visits between Cuba and Ireland at this time. Our programme of visits, both outward and inward, is kept under review on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>Relations between Ireland and Cuba have developed in recent years, particularly since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1999. Our ambassador in Mexico City is accredited to Cuba. In 2001, Cuba established a resident embassy in Dublin, which has been headed by a resident ambassador since October 2005. Prior to that the embassy was headed at charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires level, with the Cuban ambassador to Ireland resident in London. The charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires and subsequently the ambassador have been and continue to be extremely active in seeking to promote links between the two countries based, <i>inter alia</i>, on people-to-people contact and cultural activities <Col N="270"/>and many Irish people have visited Cuba in recent years.</P>
        <P>I welcome these developments and I wish to see the bilateral relationship between Ireland and Cuba develop further. Unfortunately, the ongoing large-scale violation of human rights in Cuba and the unacceptable attitude of the Cuban Government toward the resident EU embassies in Havana are a serious impediment to the further development of relations with Cuba. Large numbers of prisoners of conscience are still in detention in Cuba and its government continues to refuse to co-operate fully with the personal representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</P>
        <P>On 13 June 2005 the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council reaffirmed the validity of the 1996 common position on Cuba, and reiterated that constructive engagement remains the basis of the EU&rsquo;s policy toward Cuba. The EU&rsquo;s objective in its relations with Cuba, as set out in the common position, is to encourage a process of transition to a pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people. The Council conclusions also emphasised the importance which the Union attaches to dialogue in order to produce tangible results in the human rights, democratisation, civil, economic and political rights and co-operation spheres, and made clear that the EU remains open to resuming such dialogue with Cuba.</P>
        <P>The above remains the position of the Government and of our EU partners. I again urge the Cuban Government to release prisoners of conscience and to respect internationally acknowledged principles and practices in respect of EU missions in Havana so that dialogue can be resumed. I have no doubt but that such steps by the Cuban Government would impact positively on the next evaluation of the EU common position on Cuba.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 and 362 together.</P><Col N="271"/>
        <P>I am aware of reports which circulated on this matter and, as I stated in response to a parliamentary question on 29 March, asked my Department to look into the situation as a matter of urgency and to report back to me. The Department has been making inquiries, including within the EU and UN frameworks.</P>
        <P>I do not have confirmation of the reliability of the reports at this point. In this regard, I note a statement by a US Department of State spokesman on 14 April that officers and staff from the US Embassy in Beijing and its consulate in Shenyang have visited the area and the specific site mentioned on two separate occasions. The US Department of State spokesman indicated that in these visits its officers were allowed to tour the entire facility and grounds and found no evidence that the site is being used for any function other than as a normal public hospital.</P>
        <P>Without prejudice to the final outcome of the above enquiries, Ireland and the EU remain concerned about the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in China and have raised our concerns with the Chinese Government on many occasions.</P>
        <P>Human rights issues are a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities at both bilateral and European Union level. In our bilateral exchanges, human rights concerns were raised most recently with the Chinese Government during the visit of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to China for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day last month. At EU level, the EU-China human rights dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises its concerns with China about individual human rights cases, and more general issues such as freedom of expression and the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
        <P>At the latest round of the human rights dialogue held in Beijing on 24 October 2005 the EU raised, <i>inter alia</i>, the right to freedom of religion and the need for reform of the administrative detention system, including the associated re-education through labour, RTL, camps. The EU expressed particular concern in this regard for Falun Gong members and stated that reform of the RTL system is an issue of fundamental importance for the EU in the human rights dialogue. A number of Falun Gong practitioners were also included in the EU&rsquo;s list of individual cases of concern which was submitted to the Chinese authorities during the dialogue. The next round of the dialogue will take place in Vienna in May.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The rights of migrant workers and their families are already protected under existing national legislation and under the Irish Constitution, as well as under EU law. In addition, the rights of migrant workers and their families are also addressed by Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under international human rights instruments to which the State is already a party. These international instruments include, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
        <P>The convention referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990 and it entered into force on 1 July 2003, following ratification by the requisite number of states, 20. The convention has been open for signature and ratification since December 1990. However, to date only 34 states have ratified it. No European Union member state has as yet signed or ratified the convention, nor has any indicated an intention to do so.</P>
        <P>The position essentially is that, in order for Ireland to ratify the convention, significant changes would have to be made across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing employment, social welfare provision, education, taxation and electoral law. These changes would also have implications for our EU commitments. The operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK might also possibly be affected.</P>
        <P>As with all outstanding ratifications of international human rights instruments, the position regarding the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families is kept under review.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to questions on this matter on 22 February and 4 April 2006. At its meeting on 21 November, the General Affairs and External Relations Council agreed that a detailed EU analysis on east Jerusalem should be prepared for adoption and publication by the council on 12 December 2005. The matter was discussed in detail at the council meeting on 12 December, but consensus was not reached on the publication of an analysis, primarily because of <Col N="273"/>the domestic political developments in Israel in the intervening period.</P>
        <P>The Middle East peace process is discussed at every meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. The meetings which I attended on 7 and 21 November 2005 expressed particular concern about the implementation of Israeli policies in and around East Jerusalem, and repeated the EU position on changes to the pre-1967 borders. The EU&rsquo;s concerns were subsequently reaffirmed in the Declaration on the Middle East which was adopted by the European Council on 15 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The Government and its partners in the EU remain very seriously concerned at Israeli activities in the occupied territories, including the building of settlements, house demolitions and continuing construction of the separation barrier on occupied land. These activities are contrary to international law, and to obligations under the Quartet roadmap. They threaten to undermine a solution based on the co-existence of two viable states, and likewise the possibility of a final status agreement on Jerusalem. It remains the clear position of the EU that it will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to a question on this matter on 14 April 2006. The international community has adopted a clear and united approach in relation to the outcome of the democratic Palestinian elections on 25 January and the approval of a new Government by the Palestinian Legislative Council on 28 March. The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council which I attended on 30 January emphasised that violence and terror are incompatible with the democratic process. It urged Hamas and all other factions to renounce violence, to recognise Israel&rsquo;s right to exist, and to disarm. The council also encouraged the formation of a Government committed to a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the conflict, based on existing agreements and on the terms of the roadmap. On the same day, the international Quartet, representing the European Union, the United Nations, the United States and Russia, set out the conditions for engagement with the new Palestinian Government. The Quartet stated that all members of a future Palestinian Government <Col N="274"/>must be committed to non-violence, to recognition of Israel and to acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including those of the roadmap.</P>
        <P>On 30 March, the Quartet welcomed the efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to ensure that the new Palestinian Government commits to a platform of peace, but noted with grave concern that it has not committed itself to the principles set out by the international community. The Quartet encouraged continued humanitarian assistance to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian people, but reiterated that future assistance to the Palestinian Authority will be reviewed by donors against the Government&rsquo;s commitment to these principles.</P>
        <P>The most recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, on 10 April, agreed on a review of EU assistance to the Palestinians against the new Government&rsquo;s commitment to the principles set out by the council and by the Quartet on 30 January. The council noted that the absence of such commitment will inevitably have an effect on direct assistance to the Government. It made clear, however, that the EU will continue to provide necessary assistance to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian population. In the review process now under way, Ireland will press for a generous and wide-ranging interpretation of what constitutes such assistance. At the same time, I would emphasise that positive movement from Hamas would greatly facilitate such an approach and would serve the interests of the people of Palestine.</P>
        <P>The April meeting of the council also urged Israel to take steps to improve the humanitarian and economic situation of the Palestinian people, including the resumption of transfers of withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that, both nationally and in the multilateral framework, the Government will continue to do all that is within our capacity to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people, while taking full account of the wider political realities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the light of recent political developments in Ethiopia, including the loss of life and civil strife, a number of donors providing general or direct budget support to the <Col N="275"/>Ethiopian Government undertook a review of this type of funding. In the light of this review, they specifically and significantly decided that they would not withdraw such assistance, estimated at &euro;400 million, from Ethiopia, but rather that they would reallocate it to other programmes in that country.</P>
        <P>Ireland, unlike the above donors, does not provide general or direct budget support to the Ethiopian Government. Our assistance is largely channelled through ministries or regional authorities, and is specifically earmarked for spending on basic needs programmes such as the building of schools, the training of health workers and teacher training. These activities have a direct and positive effect on the lives of thousands of poor Ethiopians, and are helping to build a basis for real and lasting change in their lives. The programmes are carefully monitored by our embassy staff on the ground, and are also externally evaluated from time to time. The programmes have also been visited by members of the Oireachtas and by the Irish Aid Advisory Board.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 and 365 together.</P>
        <P>The statement made on 20 March by the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Asma Jahangir, is the latest in a series of reports which raise serious concerns about the situation of the Baha&rsquo;i community in Iran.</P>
        <P>My Department maintains close contacts with the Baha&rsquo;i community in Ireland about the situation of their co-religionists on the ground. In its contacts with the Iranian Embassy in Dublin the Department regularly conveys the Government&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P>Ireland has also frequently raised the situation of the Baha&rsquo;i in Iran at EU level and the EU&rsquo;s concerns about the treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i have <Col N="276"/>in turn been brought to the attention of the Iranian authorities on many occasions. Ireland and its EU partners have also supported resolutions on Iran at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights. These initiatives have brought specific attention to the plight of the Baha&rsquo;i in Iran.</P>
        <P>The situation of the Baha&rsquo;i community has also been raised during the formal EU-Iran human rights dialogues, the last session of which took place during the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2004. Iran has been reluctant to agree dates for a renewed session of the human rights dialogue and the dialogue has been in abeyance since that time, though consultations on the next session are ongoing.</P>
        <P>The external relations council on 10 April 2006 issued conclusions on Iran which underlined the EU&rsquo;s continuing concern about human rights in Iran, in particular the treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i and other religious minorities. In addition, the EU Presidency raised a number of human rights concerns directly with the Iranian Government on 11 April 2006, including the problems alluded to in the special rapporteur&rsquo;s statement. Ireland and the EU will remain engaged on this issue and will continue to raise it at all appropriate fora.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the international campaign by non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International, Oxfam and others, to have established in international law an arms trade treaty which will seriously control and regulate the production, sale and distribution of small arms and guns; if Ireland fully supports such measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I made clear in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 143 of 22 February 2006, Ireland&rsquo;s support for the concept of an arms trade treaty is unqualified. The process of negotiating such a treaty is, however, likely to be lengthy and complex and it is not at this stage possible to forecast when or in what form a final text might emerge.</P>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union, at its meeting on 3 October 2005, acknowledged the growing support throughout the world for an international treaty to establish common standards for the global trade in conventional arms. The council also agreed that binding standards, consistent with the existing responsibilities of states under relevant international law, would be critical in tackling proliferation. It was further agreed that the United Nations was the only forum that could deliver a truly universal instrument, and the council called for the start of a formal process at the UN at the earliest opportunity. At a small arms conference in New York last January, the <Col N="277"/>Austrian Presidency, on behalf of all EU member states, confirmed the European Union&rsquo;s support for an arms trade treaty.</P>
        <P>In summary, Ireland fully and strongly supports the negotiation of an arms trade treaty and we will continue to participate actively within the UN and at other international fora both to try to advance this objective and, more generally, to promote the objective of strengthening arms controls globally.</P>

        <Quest>further to the worsening drought in Kenya, the fact that people living there are facing chronic food shortages and the growing fears that the situation will quickly deteriorate, the plans the Government has in place to deal with this devastating situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Kenya and its neighbouring countries in the Horn of Africa are in the grip of a severe drought that is directly affecting up to eleven million people across the region. The drought has already killed thousands of livestock, depriving people of their livelihoods and leaving many pastoral communities destitute. It is estimated that 5 million people in Kenya alone require food aid. Over 2.5 million Ethiopians and over 2 million Somalis are directly at risk. In addition, populations in parts of Burundi, Djibouti and Eritrea are suffering the effects of the drought.</P>
        <P>The impact of poor rainfall during the long rainy season of March-June last year was compounded by the failure of the short rains in October-December. While there has been welcome rainfall across the Horn of Africa since late March, parts of Kenya have now been affected by severe flooding, resulting in the displacement of thousands of people, damage to agricultural and grazing land and an increased risk of infectious water-borne disease.</P>
        <P>Ireland responded promptly to this situation and to date has made emergency humanitarian funding of &euro;7 million available to agencies working in the Horn of Africa at both regional and national levels. Of this, over &euro;2 million has been provided to the UN world food programme and to the Irish NGOs Concern and Tr&oacute;caire for emergency programmes specifically in Kenya.</P>
        <P>The former Minister, Mr. David Andrews, is currently visiting the Horn of Africa in his capacity as Chairman of the Irish Red Cross and has kindly agreed to provide the Government with a report of the findings of his visit and his assessment of the current situation and response in the affected countries. Mr. Andrews similarly pro<Col N="278"/>vided a report to me following his visit to Niger in August 2006. This report made a valuable contribution to programming Ireland&rsquo;s response to that particular emergency.</P>
        <P>Ireland has an ongoing commitment to assist the people of Kenya in combating the causes of poverty and food insecurity. Ireland provided over &euro;3 million in funding in 2005 to non-governmental organisations working in Kenya, including Concern, Self-Help Development International, Goal, Tr&oacute;caire, Oxfam and Concern Universal. We continue to keep this situation under close review, including the effect of the recent floods on vulnerable communities in Kenya.</P>

	<P>I travelled to the United States from 11 to 17 March to represent the Government at promotional events in Dallas before attending the customary St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day ceremonies in Washington. On 17 March, I accompanied the Taoiseach to the White House for the traditional presentation of shamrock, followed by a meeting with President Bush in the Oval Office. Our discussions with the President covered Northern Ireland, immigration reform and other, including current international, issues. The Taoiseach and I also had a series of valuable meetings with key Members of Congress including Senators Biden, Clinton, Dodd, Kennedy, Leahy and McCain. We also met with Congressman Jim Walsh and members of the Friends of Ireland Group in Congress. The focus of these meetings was on Northern Ireland and immigration reform. This special opportunity, unique to Ireland, for direct and detailed dialogue with the President of the United States and his Administration, and also key players on Capitol Hill, is exceptionally valued by the Government.</P>
        <P>My programme, in Washington, also included attendance at the American-Ireland Fund national gala dinner, the lunch hosted by Speaker Hastert, and the Ambassador&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day reception. In addition, the Taoiseach and I had a very valuable meeting on immigration reform with Niall O&rsquo;Dowd and Grant Lally of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform. I also accompanied the Taoiseach to a meeting with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board. Discussions with the board focused on the successes of the Irish economy, business prospects in the US and developments in Northern Ireland. The Secretary General of my Department, the Director General of the Anglo-Irish division, my press adviser and my private secretary travelled to Washington in the official party.</P><Col N="279"/>
        <P>In Dallas, where I was accompanied by my wife, my press adviser and my private secretary, my programme included attendance at the Irish-American Society dinner, the downtown parade and a breakfast hosted by the American-Ireland Fund. I also had a briefing session with the editorial board of <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>, and addressed a lunch hosted by the Dallas Chamber of Commerce.</P>
        <P>My address to the business lunch focused on the success of the Irish economy, highlighting the theme of the Irish advantage, which was also articulated by the Taoiseach and Ministers at a wide variety of events throughout the world over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period. The importance of the Irish-American relationship, the peace process and immigration reform also featured in my remarks and discussions in Dallas. The cost of the visit, including transatlantic and internal transport and accommodation, will be approximately &euro;51,000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>For the period in question, I made 60 trips involving 74 destinations. The dates, destinations and purpose of the visits abroad made by me as Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2005 and in 2006, to date, are set out in the table attached. Several of the visits in 2005 were undertaken in my capacity <Col N="280"/>as Special Envoy of the Secretary General of the United Nations in connection with UN reform.</P>
        <P>On visits abroad, I would generally be accompanied by my private secretary, a small number of officials from the divisions of the Department whose work directly pertains to the meeting or conference in question and a press officer. On occasion, I may also be accompanied by the Secretary General of the Department, and sometimes by my special adviser.</P>
        <P>When I travelled to the countries worst affected by the tsunami disaster from 8-13 January 2005, I was accompanied on the Government jet by the heads of four Irish aid agencies &mdash; Concern, Goal, Tr&oacute;caire and the Irish Red Cross &mdash; who met their own hotel and subsistence costs. Similarly, the delegation for the Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in May 2005 included a representative of the Irish non-governmental organisation, NGO, community, who travelled at his own expense.</P>
        <P>The total travel, accommodation and subsistence costs of Departmental personnel at HQ for the conduct of official business abroad amounted to &euro;3.37 million in 2005. The corresponding figure for the first three months of 2006 amounted to &euro;820,000. The analogous costs for myself and my private secretary in 2005 came to a total of &euro;185,472; an average of &euro;3,785 for each of the 49 visits undertaken in that year. As some of the costs relating to my recent visits abroad remain to be brought to account, the corresponding figures for the first three months of 2006 are not yet available.</P>
        <P>As the subject of the question covers 60 visits abroad involving a diverse number of officials, I believe the Deputy will appreciate that the time and effort involved in collating the individual cost attributable to each official, for each visit, would be disproportionate.</P><Col N="279"/>

        <Quest>if his Department have received a copy of any of the six regional impact assessment studies carried out for the European Commission in 1998 (details supplied); if it is the case that these studies showed the proposed economic partnership agreements will cause largely unfavourable results for ACP countries; if he will place those reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>These studies were commissioned when the Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries was being negotiated. Article 37 of that agreement expressly provides for the conclusion of Economic Partnership Agreements, EPAs, between the EU and ACP countries.</P><Col N="284"/>
        <P>While it is true that the impact assessment studies in question highlight a number of areas of potential concern, such as weak institutional capacity and tariff revenue losses, they do not conclude that the EPAs would be largely unfavourable. Due to a number of limiting factors the studies may be said not to present a convincing case either for or against EPAs. The studies were largely desk-based, they did not cover all ACP countries and regions and complete and accurate data was difficult to obtain.</P>
        <P>At the same time, the studies are a useful tool in that they draw attention to areas of concern. In this regard, the European Commission is committed to the ongoing review of the EPA process, through the Sustainability Impact Assessment, SIA, aspect of the negotiations. This is a project of consultation through which all stakeholders, including regional organisations, ACP representatives, civil society and business representatives, provide input.</P>
        <P>At the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg on 10 and 11 April, which I attended, the council invited the Com<Col N="285"/>mission to ensure that the scheduled review of the EPA negotiations in 2006 be formal and comprehensive. The review will be based on a regional approach and will examine both trade and development aspects of EPAs, including cross-cutting issues.</P>
        <P>In this regard also, the Government welcomes Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s commitment to keep development at the heart of these negotiations. The Government will continue to follow the negotiations closely, and will emphasise they be conducted at all times in a manner sensitive to the needs of the ACP states. As requested, the Department of Foreign Affairs is making arrangements for the studies in question to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>Lesotho has a special place in the history of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance. The Lesotho aid programme, established in 1975, was our first and for many years our largest development cooperation programme.</P>
        <P>The upgrading of the mission in Lesotho to full ambassadorial level reflects both the significance of our present aid programme in that country and also a decision in principle to upgrade the missions in our programme countries in Africa. In this regard, four missions &mdash; Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia &mdash; will be upgraded to full ambassadorial level this year.</P><Col N="286"/>
        <P>Lesotho is one of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, ranked 149 on the UN Human Development Index, HDI. Half the population lives below the poverty line, less than $1 a day, and over 30% of the adult population are living with HIV-AIDS &mdash; one of the highest rates of infections in the world. Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme in Lesotho is primarily directed at rural communities located in the remote mountain districts where poverty is deepest, with a clear focus on health and education. Irish Aid also assists in the improvement of basic infrastructure in rural areas &mdash; roads, footbridges, water supplies and sanitation facilities.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid&rsquo;s activities in Lesotho are set out in a country strategy paper, which is agreed with the Government of Lesotho every three years. The current country strategy covers the period 2005-07. Decisions on the future direction of the programme will be based on the findings of an evaluation of the current programme to be carried out during 2007.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the Niger Delta humanitarian crisis in which mass killings have occurred; the steps the international community is taking to deal with the issues of ethnic cleansing; if Ireland has repatriated asylum seekers to the area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While attacks against oil installations in the Niger Delta region have occurred for a number of years, and while the level and intensity of these attacks have increased significantly since the start of 2006, it would not be correct to characterise these events as mass killings or ethnic cleansing.</P>
        <P>The growing insecurity and violence highlights long-standing problems of lack of development in the Niger Delta region and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the allocation of oil revenues. The Irish Ambassador to Nigeria has participated, together with his EU counterparts, in a number of visits to the region. The EU Ambassadors are seeking to engage local State and community leaders in dialogue in order to discuss how the problems of the Delta region can better be addressed. Federal and state authorities can also contribute to tackling the problems of the Niger Delta, through putting in place a long-term development plan for the region. On 18 April, President Obasanjo inaugurated the presidential committee on socio-economic development of the Niger Delta which brings together a panel of high level officials to recommend to him specific projects for rapid development of the region in the near future. The President promised that thousands of new jobs will be created in the oil industry, the military and the police, and that a US$1.8 billion motorway will be built.</P><Col N="287"/>
        <P>As regards the specific violence in the region, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, MEND, has claimed responsibility for a series of serious incidents, including attacks against security forces and the kidnapping of expatriate oil workers. In mid-January, four police officers and eight assailants were killed in one incident. MEND is demanding the release of two local leaders, including the former Governor of Bayelsa state who is currently facing corruption charges, as well as greater local control over oil wealth and the sum of $1.5 billion for the clean up of the local environment. MEND has claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack on an army barracks in Port Harcourt in which two civilians died on 19 April. The campaign waged by MEND has contributed to a significant reduction of more than 20% in Nigerian oil production since the start of the year. Close attention must be paid to the Niger Delta situation when considering any plans for possible deployment of an EU election observation mission, in the context of next year&rsquo;s national elections in Nigeria.</P>
        <P>As regards the repatriation of unsuccessful asylum applicants to Nigeria, this is an issue for which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility. Individuals so repatriated are normally flown to a major national centre such as Lagos and may subsequently remain in this national centre or travel wherever they wish within Nigeria.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the European Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation regarding the Council of Ministers meeting in public. I have frequently expressed my support for greater transparency in the business of the Council of Ministers, particularly when performing its legislative functions. I would recall that Article I &mdash; 24.6 of the Constitutional Treaty provides that the Council of Ministers should meet in public when it is considering and voting on draft legislative acts. I value this aspect of the Constitutional Treaty, which can help strengthen the democratic credibility of the European Union.</P>
        <P>The Council of Ministers has already responded to increased public interest in the functioning of the European Union by improving the transparency of its own proceedings. In December 2005, the Council of Ministers decided to take a number of practical steps to promote greater openness and transparency. As a consequence, deliberations and votes on legislative <Col N="288"/>proposals governed by co-decision procedures, with the European Parliament, are to be video-streamed over the internet. This will ensure that they are available to the widest possible audience. The Council of Ministers also decided to increase the amount of non-legislative business which is to be conducted in public session. In March, policy debates in the environment, competitiveness, employment and transport councils were held in public session. There is also agreement that the Council of Ministers will review these new arrangements and I hope that this will lead to a further opening up of the business of the Council of Ministers to active public scrutiny.</P>

	<P>Only an Irish citizen is entitled to be issued with an Irish passport. The person, to whom the Deputy refers, is not entitled to Irish citizenship through descent as neither of her parents was an Irish citizen at the time of her birth. Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 2004, the basic requirement for obtaining citizenship by descent, through what is called foreign births registration, is that the applicant&rsquo;s parent was an Irish citizen when the applicant was born. There is no provision in law for an exception to be made to the statutory requirements.</P>
        <P>The only means open to the person to become an Irish citizen would be through naturalisation. Consideration of all applications for naturalisation is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is internationally recognised as being of the highest quality. It is centred on some of the least developed countries in the world and on reducing poverty among the poorest of the poor. Successive evaluations by the OECD have endorsed its design and implementation. Last year a survey by ActionAid concluded that aid <Col N="289"/>from Ireland really reached and directly benefited its target groups.</P>
        <P>The Development Assistance Committee, DAC, of the OECD, of which Ireland is a member, has established rules and guidelines for the calculation of Official Development Assistance, ODA. These rules include as ODA certain expenditures on debt relief and debt cancellation, objectives which Ireland has strongly supported. Ireland is not a creditor of the developing countries and has not had bilateral debts to cancel. Ireland has however contributed to debt relief in multilateral institutions through the HIPC initiative and will contribute &euro;59 million this year to the multilateral debt relief initiative at the World Bank. This contribution has been decided by the Minister for Finance and is a very welcome addition to the previously agreed budget for development co-operation.</P>
        <P>The rules also permit the inclusion of certain costs associated with refugees, either in a donor country or in a recipient country. Preliminary figures for 2005 show payments by Ireland of about &euro;2 million, or 0.4% of our total ODA, relating mainly to the cost of the resettlement programme operated in co-operation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. These costs are borne by the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs. Clearly and demonstrably, the Concord statement does not apply to this State or to the Irish aid programme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of Amnesty International&rsquo;s thorough and detailed report into the issue of extraordinary rendition. The Government has made clear on numerous occasions its complete opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition.</P>
        <P>The report highlights the difficulties attached to trying to track the aircraft and companies that are said to be involved in this practice. It seems clear that any regime based on specific aircraft registration numbers or operators would be of limited efficacy.</P>
        <P>It remains the case that there is a complete lack of any evidence that prisoners have been, or are being, transferred through Shannon Airport. Moreover, nothing in the report questions the value of, or undermines, the categorical, factual assurances we have received from the US auth<Col N="290"/>orities that prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.</P>
        <P>The Government is co-operating with a number of Europe-wide investigations into extraordinary rendition. Its reply to the Council of Europe questionnaire on the matter was one of only nine out of 46 replies which were adjudged to be sufficiently comprehensive not to require further clarification. We have said we will look very carefully at any concrete proposals for reform which may emerge.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, and the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, are both key partners in Ireland&rsquo;s programme of assistance in Palestine. Ireland provides annual funding to both of these agencies and we liaise closely with them through Ireland&rsquo;s representative in Ramallah. In 2005, Ireland delivered over &euro;4 million in development and humanitarian assistance to Palestine. Some &euro;2 million of Ireland&rsquo;s funding was provided to UNRWA and &euro;500,000 of this was ring-fenced for Gaza.</P>
        <P>The Government is extremely conscious of the need to continue assistance to Palestine, including Gaza, with particular emphasis on meeting humanitarian needs. In response to UNRWA&rsquo;s appeal for funding, Ireland provided early funding of &euro;1.5 million to UNRWA in 2006. This was core funding which allows UNRWA to respond flexibly to the challenging situation on the ground. Ireland will continue to respond to emerging humanitarian needs in Palestine, and we have made clear that we are determined to maintain the overall volume of our assistance to Palestine.</P>
        <P>The situation in Gaza has, however, become increasingly difficult because of restrictions on access and movement to and from the area. Last year Ireland provided &euro;200,000 in support of the EU border assistance mission at Rafah, which was established to give effect to the EU&rsquo;s third party role in the implementation of the agreement on movement and access concluded between Israel and the Palestinian Authority on 15 November last. I share the general concern expressed about the failure of the parties so far to reach agreement on the implementation of the <Col N="291"/>other elements of that agreement, and in common with our EU partners the Government has consistently called on both parties to implement their commitments.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the situation in Gaza is of course bound up with wider developments in the Middle East peace process, including the consequences of the election of the Hamas Government. At the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 April, it was agreed that the EU would review its assistance to the Palestinians, against the new Government&rsquo;s commitment to the principles set out in the quartet&rsquo;s statement of 30 January. The council recalled that the absence of such commitment will inevitably have an effect on direct assistance to that Government. The EU will, however, continue to provide necessary assistance to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian population. In the review process, Ireland will press for a generous and wide-ranging interpretation of what constitutes such assistance. At the same time, positive movement from Hamas would greatly facilitate such an approach and would serve the interests of the people of Palestine.</P>
        <P>The council also urged Israel to take steps to improve the humanitarian and economic situation of the Palestinians, including by resuming transfers of the withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues. I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will, both nationally and in the multilateral framework, do all that is within our capacity to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people, while being cognisant of the wider political realities.</P>

	<P>The legal division of the Department of Foreign Affairs comprises seven lawyers and is headed by the legal adviser. The role of the division is primarily to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Department on matters of public international law, human rights law and EU law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the review group, paragraphs 4.13-4.17, acknowledges the distinction between the role of the legal division and that of other departmental legal officers. It notes the distinct and long-standing nature of the post, since 1929, and the focus of legal division on public international law. The report provides that &ldquo;it is clear that a public international law advisory section located in the Department of Foreign Affairs makes sense, because public international law is continually evolving in line with state practice and is informed by policy considerations to an extent unknown in other branches of law&rdquo;. It also recognises that the role of legal adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs is well established on the international level and is &ldquo;the usual way in which the legal services required by Foreign Ministries are organised&rdquo;. It is a particular role which is common to all member states of the European Union and the United Nations.</P>
        <P>Names of officers: Legal adviser: Ms Patricia O&rsquo;Brien. Deputy legal adviser: Mr. James Kingston. Assistant legal advisers: Ms Emer Kilcullen; Mr. Brendan McMahon; Ms Lisa Walshe; Ms Nuala N&iacute; Mhuircheartaigh; Mr. Trevor Redmond.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. In the period 1998 to 2005 a total of 10,540 applications have been received under the programme, which is advertised on an annual basis. This has resulted in the allocation of almost &euro;395 million in grants in respect of 4,923 sporting projects in cities, towns and villages the length and breadth of Ireland.</P>
        <P>All applications received under the sports capital programme are assessed on an individual basis by officials in the sports unit of my Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria as specified in the guidelines, terms and conditions for the programme, which accompany the application form for the programme. In addition to factors such as sporting impact, levels of disadvantage and financial viability, the assessment process takes into account existing levels of sport and recreational sport facilities in an area. In making recommendations on grant allocations, my Department uses the population levels in each county, currently based on the 2002 census figures, to determine a pro-rata level of funding.</P>
        <P>Part of the assessment process includes consultations with other Departments and a range of bodies, including the Irish Sports Council, national governing bodies of sport and local authorities to identify projects of strategic importance. This consultation process provides an opportunity to prioritise projects that will fill identified gaps across the sporting landscape and target high population growth areas. The population data arising from the 2006 census including information on areas enjoying significant population increases will be used in future assessments of <Col N="295"/>applications made under the sports capital programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Work has commenced on the audit with the immediate task being to establish a record of national and regional sports facilities as a first phase of the project. Ascertaining and mapping what is already in place is an important part of developing a strategic approach to future facility provision in terms of establishing the level of need that still exists in the sports sector and in helping to determine future priorities. It is expected that the data derived from the national audit of sports facilities will greatly assist and guide the assessment process of grant applications in the future. I expect that the first phase of the audit will be will be completed in advance of the 2007 sports capital programme. It will not therefore be available in time for the 2006 programme.</P>

	<P>Last month Kilkenny County Council submitted contract documents to my Department in respect of a replacement swimming pool in Kilkenny. These documents are currently being examined by the Department and its technical advisers, the Office of Public Works. I expect to be in a position shortly to approve of the contract documents which will enable the county council to invite tenders for the work proposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>In November 2005 the Government gave its assent to the commencement of phase 1 of the development of the national sports campus at Abbotstown. Phase 1 of the development control plan will provide a national field sports training centre, catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a national indoor training centre which will provide world class training facilities for over 30 governing bodies of sport; accommodation for sports men and women; sports science and medical facilities; all-weather <Col N="299"/>synthetic pitches for community use and renovation of existing buildings to cater for needs identified by sports bodies.</P>
        <P>While a dedicated gymnastics facility is not provided for in phase 1 of the development control plan for the national sports campus at Abbotstown, some gymnastics activities will be accommodated in the national indoor training centre. CSID had a meeting with the Irish Gymnastics Association on 6 April 2006. CSID advised the association that it would be willing to consider any proposal that the association may have for the development of a stand-alone facility in a future phase of the development.</P>
        <P>Under the sports capital project, grants are provided by my Department for the provision of sports facilities and equipment for a range of sports. Under the 2005 sports capital programme, nine grants totalling &euro;101,000 were allocated in respect of gymnastics projects. Almost &euro;11.5 million was allocated in 2005 for community or mixed projects, many of which would be suitable for gymnastics.</P>

	<P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>In this regard, primary and post-primary schools wishing to be considered for funding under the programme may only apply for funding jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must meet other conditions including a requirement that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility, at least 30 hours a week throughout the year, when it is not being used by the school itself. Any sports facility proposed for funding by a sporting organisation and which would be located within school grounds would have to meet these same conditions.</P>
        <P>In order to encourage full use of facilities funded, applications for funding are requested to indicate the extent to which they have consulted with other clubs and organisations in the community, including schools. A commitment from schools that they will in fact utilise the intended facility would be important and would increase the project&rsquo;s assessment score. Any such applications received this year will be considered and assessed on that basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Concerning applications under the sports capital programme for funding for facilities based in third level institutions, these are assessed on a case-by-case basis, particularly within the context of developing key, strategic, national and regional facilities which would also be open for use by the wider community</P>

        <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing capital funding for sports facilities, including those relating to track and field.

        <P>The Irish Film Board is responsible for the promotion and support of film-making in Ireland. The board is funded by my Department, but is independent on a day-to-day basis in respect of its support decisions.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have information on the number of films in production at any given time.

	<P>There is no record of a valid work permit application in this case. Applications which are incomplete or incorrect are returned to <Col N="306"/>the employer for completion. In the aftermath of EU enlargement, it is Government policy that employers should be able to source nearly all of their workforce needs from within the EU. Accordingly, only in cases where exceptional levels of skill and qualifications are needed for the job, and the employer has made meaningful attempts to find EEA nationals first, will my Department now consider work permit applications.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 409 and 410 together.</P>
        <P>In April 2005, the Commission published its proposal for the seventh framework programme, FP7, which will cover the period 2007 to 2013. Consideration of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, which involves co-decision procedures with the European Parliament, is still under way. In this regard, divergent views exist among member states on the question of the Community funding human embryonic stem cell research.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s proposal for FP7 represents a &ldquo;no change&rdquo; policy from FP6 and the core principle of ethical subsidiarity is guaranteed. A large number of member states can support the Commission proposal on this issue. Some member states, including Ireland, have not yet established or presented their definitive positions while Germany, Austria, Italy, Poland, Malta, Luxembourg and Slovakia are currently opposed to the proposal. At this stage, the Presidency has not put forward any compromise text. The views of all member states will be taken into account in finalising Ireland&rsquo;s position in this matter.</P>
        <P>Under FP6 the funding of ethically sensitive projects is dealt with through a process of ethical review. In summary, all such projects are submitted to a rigorous four stage process before being funded &mdash; national ethical review, European scientific evaluation, European ethical review and consideration by a committee of member states. <Col N="307"/>The scientific evaluation also assesses whether the use of human embryonic stem cells is necessary to achieve the scientific objectives set forth in the project. At this stage in FP6 more than 90% of the research projects where stem cells are involved concern adult stem cells. Only eight projects have been approved using human embryonic stem cells. Ireland is not involved in any of these projects. The &ldquo;no change&rdquo; policy approach proposed for FP7 will similarly take into account the therapeutic potential of human adult stem cells.</P>
        <P>EU research programmes do not fund in a member state, under any circumstances, anything that is not legal or is deemed unethical in that particular member state.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>when the review of capping on the community employment scheme is due to be complete; the terms of reference of this review; if it includes consultation with community employment participants, supervisors and F&Aacute;S co-ordinators; if an opportunity will be given to these important stakeholders to air their views regarding changes to the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[14362/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Following a review of the operation of F&Aacute;S employment schemes &mdash; community employment, job initiative and social economy programmes &mdash; a number of changes were announced on 10 November 2004. The views and concerns expressed by key stakeholders, including the social partners, were taken into account in deciding on the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements are as follows. There are no compulsory lay-offs on the job initiative scheme, JI; participants who remain on JI have their contracts renewed. People who leave JI voluntarily are being replaced by CE participants to support the service being provided. There has been no compulsory cessation of social economy programmes, which have played a very valuable role in communities throughout the country. In cases where an enterprise decided itself to cease activity, the employees affected have been assisted by F&Aacute;S in finding alternative employment. On 1 January 2006, the social economy programme transferred to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and is being administered by ADM-Pobal.</P>
        <P>For CE participants, the three year cap has been removed for the over 55s. Over 55s are now eligible to participate on community employment for a maximum of six years. In the case of people advancing beyond 55 years during their normal period of service on CE, participation can be extended for up to a maximum of six years. The current ring-fencing and prioritisation for the <Col N="308"/>essential services of child care, health related services and drugs task force clients is being maintained. In 2005, there were 25,000 places overall on community employment schemes, job initiative schemes and social economy programmes and a similar number of places have been provided during 2006.</P>
        <P>While there is no formal review taking place regarding the caps in the CE scheme, the operation of the scheme is kept under constant review.</P>

The circumstances of the liquidation will be addressed by the liquidator in his report to the Director of Corporate Enforcement in accordance with section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. The timeframe for this report is within six months of the liquidator&rsquo;s appointment, which in this instance is mid-June 2006.</P>

	<P>Arising from concern that all Turkish workers would have access to the money that had been transferred to their bank accounts in Finansbank in Amsterdam, I and officials of the Department met with senior management from Gama Turkey and Gama Ireland, the legal advisers to Gama Turkey and a human resources consultant, retained by Gama. At that meeting, I was assured by these senior managers, their legal adviser and the human resources consultant that all Gama workers in Ireland, past and present, would have full access to the money that had been transferred to their bank accounts in Finansbank.</P>
        <P>I contacted the president of Finansbank. The president assured me that, provided the consent of the workers was forthcoming, his bank would co-operate in ensuring that the Department&rsquo;s officials would have sight of relevant bank records in his bank, so that they could be satisfied that all workers would have access to the money in their bank accounts. Officials from my Department travelled to Finansbank on 14 April 2005. Following these meetings and contacts which my officials had with SIPTU and the Deputy, I am satisfied that a substantial number of Turkish workers, who were in Ireland around last April, received value for the funds that had been transferred to their personal bank accounts in Finansbank.</P>
        <P>The Department wrote to Gama Turkey&rsquo;s legal advisers on 29 April 2005 seeking certain details on each current and former Gama employee, including the money transferred to Finansbank and the money transferred from Finansbank to their personal bank account in Isbank in Turkey. Despite reminders to Gama Turkey&rsquo;s legal advisers and engagement with an intermediary engaged by Gama, this information was not supplied at the time. Some weeks ago a substantial volume of data was presented by Gama to the Department and was examined by my officials. The information supplied was not sufficient to enable me to assure the Deputy that all Gama workers in Ireland, both past and present, have received value for the amounts that were transferred into their personal accounts in Finansbank.</P>
        <P>The Department has advised Gama by letter dated 4 April 2006 that the material recently supplied does not enable the establishment of the <Col N="310"/>factual position relating to the workers about whom I am concerned. Gama has been asked again to supply the missing information.</P>

        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland and its regions. The Forf&aacute;s annual employment survey records jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the industrial development agencies. Data are compiled on an annualised basis. Individual company data are compiled on a confidential basis in this survey and thus details in respect of company job losses and gains cannot be released. Details of jobs created and lost for each of the counties in respect of each of the years from 2003 to 2005 are set out in the table. </P><Col N="309"/>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>An application for a statutory redundancy rebate payment from Irish Ferries under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003 was received by my Department on 17 February 2006. It was submitted by means of the new redundancy on-line application system. The matter has been referred to the Attorney General as a matter of some urgency for advice on whether a genuine redundancy situation exists in this case and whether the rebate can therefore be paid from the social insurance fund. On receipt of this advice from the Attorney General, a decision will be made on the issue.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the statutory redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers whose jobs no longer exist. It would certainly be the policy of the Government to pay a rebate only in situations where the strict criteria stipulating genuine grounds for redundancy under section 7 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, as amended by section 4 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971 and section 5 of the Redundancy Payments Act 2003, are applicable.</P>

        <Quest>the detailed process that was involved in the selection of the current chief executive of the National Consumer Agency; the procedures that were put in place to ensure the selected candidate met basic criteria, for example, sufficient leadership skills and experience, expertise and experience in managing large budgets, communication skills, strategic planning and management experience; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The core recommendation in the consumer strategy group report, Make Consumers Count, was the establishment of a new national consumer agency, a recommendation which was fully accepted by the Government. The establishment of the new agency will require primary legislation and work on the preparation of that legislation is well under way in my Department. In the interim period until the NCA is formally established, I appointed an interim board to the NCA to ensure that the momentum of the work of the consumer strategy group was maintained.</P>
        <P>Since its appointment the interim board has been very active in terms of advocating the consumer&rsquo;s case on issues such as the groceries order as well as promoting greater awareness of consumer rights. The activities of the interim board are expected to increase significantly in 2006 and, to that end, funding totalling &euro;3 million has been allocated in my Department&rsquo;s Vote to support these activities. A key element of the interim board&rsquo;s activities, as identified in the terms of reference approved by Government, will be to prepare the way for the new statutory agency.</P>
        <P>Given the important role for the interim board in constructing the new agency, together with the significant expected increase in its activities, it was considered appropriate that the board should have the support of a full-time executive. To that end, the current chairperson of the interim board was asked to assume a full-time position of executive chairperson for a period of one year. I am satisfied that the chairperson&rsquo;s experience not only in her existing non-executive capacity on the interim board but also as the chairperson of the consumer strategy group and her wider experience in other areas of economic life eminently qualify her for appointment to this temporary executive assignment. I am confident her appointment as a full-time executive will allow the chairperson to enable the interim board to carry out its agreed terms of reference and, in addition, ensure that all the necessary preparations are made so that the national consumer agency can hit the ground running once it is formally established.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <P>Notwithstanding the temporary appointment of an executive chairperson to the interim board, it is the intention that the statutory agency, when established, will be governed by a non-executive appointed board supported by a full-time chief executive officer who will be recruited by way of open competition in accordance with normal public service procedures.</P>

	<P>The Industrial Development Authority has been designated an autonomous body under the Industrial Development Acts. One of the functions assigned to the authority in this capacity is to foster the national objective of <Col N="314"/>balanced regional development and this is being pursued within the framework of the national spatial strategy.</P>
        <P>I understand from IDA Ireland that regional development has been made a central feature of its strategy and operations, that the agency has a target of 50% of all new greenfield jobs to be located in the region in the period 2000-06 and that substantial progress has been achieved to date in that regard. Prior to the start of the Government&rsquo;s current national development programme, only some 25% of all new greenfield jobs were locating in the region compared to circa 43% at end 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To support and enhance the promotion of the BMW region, IDA Ireland has increased its land portfolio in the region from circa 29% in 1998 to circa 43% at end-2005. A combined regions and property division has been established within the agency in Athlone and sectoral development responsibilities have been regionalised, with ICT now located in Waterford, medical technologies in Athlone and engineering in Sligo, to drive the regional development agenda from within the regions.</P>
        <P>The agency is also working close with a wide range of other organisations at local and regional levels, such as local authorities, utility providers, educational institutes, private developers and so forth, to enhance the attractiveness of individual areas for new greenfield investments or expansion projects that will deliver quality sustainable jobs. This is important in the context that investors have the ultimate say in regard to what area is chosen for a project, including what areas to visit as potential locations.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland in furtherance of its statutory function and assigned responsibilities, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will continue to bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of the BMW region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 13 county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, operating in the Border, midlands and western region. Under the BMW Regional Operational Programme 2000-2006 these boards are responsible for delivering the micro-enterprise measure throughout the BMW region.</P>
        <P>The BMW region&rsquo;s Objective One status allows the use of comparatively better rates of <Col N="315"/>incentives to business and assists the region in promoting and developing indigenous micro-enterprises. This status is also taken into account in allocating funds to the boards in the region. In 2005, for example, the funds allocated to the region amounted to some 37% of the total funds allocated even though only about 27% of the national population reside in the region. This high level of funding for the BMW region has been maintained in 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The function of the CEBs in the BMW region is to develop indigenous enterprise potential, to stimulate economic activity and to promote an enterprise culture at local level. The CEBs are a specific source of support for the micro-enterprise sector, that is, businesses with ten employees or fewer. This support is available through both direct financial assistance and non-financial assistance. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, micro-enterprises may qualify for financial support in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants while there is also a broad range of non-financial supports available, such as mentoring, management development and training and business advice and information.</P>
        <P>In providing support to enterprises, the CEBs are required to take into consideration the quality, local relevance, cost effectiveness and viability of proposals. They must also seek to avoid supporting projects that would displace existing jobs or businesses. In this regard, the boards are required to give priority to manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, which over time may develop into strong export entities. The local base of the CEBs which are responsible for the delivery of the micro-enterprise measure in the BMW region means that the projects supported are tailored to the particular needs of that regional economic environment.</P>
        <P>The CEBs in the BMW region performed strongly in 2005. They paid out over &euro;4 million in direct grant aid to 350 projects and assisted in the creation of over 1,000 net jobs in grant aided companies. The CEBs also provided training and management development programmes to the value of &euro;3.4 million to 4,566 participants in the BMW region, of which 2,588 or almost 57% were female.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The issues of job creation and retention in Enterprise Ireland supported companies are day-to-day matters for the agency itself <Col N="316"/>and not ones in which I am directly involved. Enterprise Ireland has at its core the objective of supporting and stimulating balanced regional development, in line with the vision set out in the national spatial strategy, and to maximise national resources allocated under the national development plan.</P>
        <P>In the period 2000 to 2005, 21,413 new jobs have been created in Enterprise Ireland client companies located in the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region. In 2005, 38% or some 4,187 of all new jobs created in Enterprise Ireland client companies were in the BMW region.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s policy objectives for balanced regional development are reflected in the structure of its funding offer, for example, funding for existing company expansion is biased towards the BMW region. The maximum grant level is higher than in Dublin and the mid-east and a higher proportion of this funding is also non-repayable. Enterprise Ireland provides a range of supports to companies in the BMW which wish to expand through increased export activity. In particular, through its network of 33 international offices, Enterprise Ireland assists companies to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth.</P>
        <P>Through Enterprise Ireland, State support for entrepreneurship is clearly focused on the ongoing creation of new entrepreneur led business entities. For the six year period 1999 to 2005, inclusive, Enterprise Ireland assisted 410 high potential start-up, HPSU, projects of which 89 were based in the BMW region. In 2005, Enterprise Ireland supported the establishment of 75 new export focused high potential companies. Of these companies, 16 or 21% were based in the BMW region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy for 2005-07 places a strong emphasis on increasing even further the number of new start-ups in the regions outside Dublin and increasing the growth rate of these companies. To accelerate this process Enterprise Ireland launched, in 2005, the enterprise start programme, a workshop based programme designed to help entrepreneurs make decisions regarding the feasibility of their business ideas and give insights into the essential elements involved in creating a new enterprise.</P>
        <P>As Ireland positions herself as a knowledge based, technology driven economy, Enterprise Ireland is working intensively with client companies in the BMW to achieve success by: investing in research in emerging technologies which can generate ideas and processes with commercial potential; assisting researchers in commercialising research to get technology out of third level institutions and into companies to realise new sales opportunities; working with clients to invest in research and development and use technology to their advantage; and assisting companies to understand technology trends through technology <Col N="317"/>road map seminars that set out what opportunities are likely to emerge.</P>

	<P>Under section 20 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, every employer has a duty to prepare a written safety statement identifying hazards and assessing the specific risks at the place of work, outlining protective and preventive measures taken and emergency plans.</P>
        <P>Employers are required to bring the safety statement to the attention of their employees in a form, manner and language likely to be understood by them. New staff must be made aware of the safety statement upon commencement of employment. Existing staff must be notified of its contents at least annually and at any other time following its amendment. Employers also have a duty to bring the safety statement to the attention of other persons at the place of work who may be exposed to any specific risk to which the safety statement applies.</P>
        <P>Section 10 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 requires employers to provide instruction, training and supervision for their employees. Training must be provided in a form, manner and language that is reasonably likely to be understood by the employee concerned. Employees must receive safety and health training specific to the tasks they perform. Training must be provided to employees on recruitment, transfer, assignment to a new task, on the introduction of new technology and it must be adapted to keep pace with changed risks in the workplace.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health and Safety Authority, which has day-to-day responsibility for the administration and enforcement of occupational safety and health legislation, operates under a broadly based enforcement and prevention programme, aimed at promoting and ensuring compliance with the legislation in its totality, including with regard to the requirements relating to safety statements and safety training. The authority&rsquo;s inspectors prioritise their inspections so that workplaces or sectors that are less compliant are targeted. Notwithstanding this, there has been a consistent increase in the percentage of workplaces inspected that have safety statements. A total of 76% of workplaces inspected in 2005 had safety statements available. Of these safety statements, 55% were in full or broad compliance with the regulatory requirements.</P>
        <P>The work programme of the Health and Safety Authority targets health and safety management and the responsibilities of directors for particular enforcement action during 2006. There are over 200,000 workplaces in Ireland and to make the best use of its resources, the authority is prioritising a number of sectors for attention. These include the high risk sectors of agriculture, construction and mines and quarries, as well as the <Col N="320"/>health services, local authorities and process industries.</P>
        <P>While much of the authority&rsquo;s work is by necessity sector specific or hazard specific, there are many programmes that clearly span all sectors and hazards.

The practice of establishing task forces has changed since the establishment of the county development boards.

The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has recently approved funding for metropolitan area networks to be installed in each town, which should assist in attracting FDI and indigenous industry.</P>
        <P>The Tipperary North County Enterprise Board is a source of support specifically for the micro-businesses sector. The role of the board is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and an enterprise culture within north Tipperary. This is done through both direct financial assistance and non-financial assistance. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, enterprises may qualify for support from the CEB primarily in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants, while there is a broad range of <Col N="322"/>non-financial supports available such as mentoring, business advice, information, management development and training.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies in furtherance of their statutory functions, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Thurles and the wider north Tipperary area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Health and Safety Authority has a commitment in its programme of work for 2006 to develop proposals for regulations under section 13(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which Act commenced on 1 September 2005. I wrote to the Health and Safety Authority in October 2005 seeking proposals.</P>
        <P>I understand that in January and February of this year, four preliminary public consultation meetings were held by the Health and Safety Authority throughout the country at which, among other issues, the matter of intoxicants at work was discussed. When proposals for draft regulations are prepared by the authority they will be issued for formal public consultation in accordance with section 57 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>
        <P>I have no indication, as yet, as to the timetable for submission of a draft to me for consideration. However, once received I intend to bring the draft regulations to the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business for its views.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 434 and 435 together.</P>
        <P>Overall responsibility for leading on the implementation of the national spatial strategy, NSS, rests with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. In so far as enterprise development is concerned, the designation of Cavan and Monaghan as hub towns should have a positive impact on their marketability and development. Both towns are strategically located and have improving interaction with substantial urban centres in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The marketing of individual towns and counties for job creation and investment is a day-to-day operational matter for the development agencies and while I may give general policy directives to agencies, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others. However, I am informed by the development agencies under my remit that they are actively promoting these locations for additional investment and job creation.</P>
        <P>Following the publication of the NSS, IDA Ireland set about adjusting its regional strategy to conform with the NSS and formally adopted a gateway approach. The agency is promoting these hub towns for foreign direct investment through its overseas network of offices. Enterprise Ireland works with and provides a range of supports to its 103 client companies in County Cavan and 141 client companies in County Monaghan. In this regard Enterprise Ireland encourages and facilitates clients&rsquo; investment in innovation and productivity improvement initiatives, and delivers first time exporter workshops followed by market visits for all prospective new exporters. Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland support the development of entrepreneurship in the regions through assistance to, and collaboration with, local authorities, third level institutions and the regional development structures and bodies.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the Cavan and Monaghan county enterprise boards will continue to be actively involved in the economic development of the counties and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development throughout the locality. This will be done not just by direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice, all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the agencies in these counties, <Col N="324"/>together with the ongoing commitment by Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs.</P>

	<P>The administration of the community enterprise centre, CEC, scheme is a day-to-day matter for Enterprise Ireland and not one in which I am directly involved. Enterprise Ireland advertised the 2006 CEC scheme in a public call for proposals in the national press on 19 and 20 January 2006. The closing date for receipt of applications is 27 April 2006.</P>
        <P>As this is a competitive scheme, there is no allocation of funding on a county-by-county basis. All applications will be assessed and eligible projects will be evaluated and approved by the Enterprise Ireland board or a decision making committee appointed by the Enterprise Ireland board. Where the number of suitable applications exceeds the available funding, those ranked highest against the published criteria will be supported.</P>
        <P>I understand that on 12 April last, Enterprise Ireland west regional staff met with the group named by the Deputy to discuss its proposed CEC application and that the agency is now awaiting receipt of the group&rsquo;s formal application.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Community employment, CE, is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and assisting them to enhance-develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>As part of the restructuring of CE approved in 1999, future participation in CE by an individual <Col N="325"/>was capped at three years, effective from April 2000. This change was introduced to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training/education options where possible. The three year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. In general, approximately 20% of participants, including persons less than 55 years of age, may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001. However, depending on the circumstances, F&Aacute;S may approve additional time on a scheme to address the needs of individual participants or to maintain service provision.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, the three year CE cap was revised to allow those of 55 years of age and over <Col N="326"/>to avail of a six year period on CE, based on participation since 3 April 2000. This was in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into employment. It also helps to maintain the provision of worthwhile community projects.</P>

        <Quest>if his Department has legal advisers of its own, naming the officers in question; and the reason effect has not been given to the recommendation in the report of the review into the law offices of the State, 1997, that legal advice should be given to the Government only by the Attorney General and his office.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15797/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The following is the position with regard to the number of legal advisers employed by the Department and the offices of the Department. It is not the practice of my Department to disclose the names of civil servants.</P>
        <P>The legal adviser employed by the Department in the company law area was recruited following a recommendation made in the report of the working group on company law compliance and enforcement. The working group was established in 1998 to identify ways of improving compliance with, and enforcement of, company law from a legislative, organisational and resources perspective. The report recommended that a full-time principal solicitor be recruited exclusively to assist company investigations work and to provide legal advice on company law issues that arise daily.</P>
        <P>On its establishment, three legal adviser posts were assigned to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. As an enforcement body, ODCE requires internal legal advice for the director to implement the Companies Acts and to assist in the investigation and prosecution of criminal and civil cases. The legal adviser in the Companies Registration Office is subject on matters of legal opinion to the Attorney General and seeks decisions from his office as necessary.</P>
        <P>The registrar of companies regularly has to make decisions requiring interpretations of law. There is extensive correspondence with legal firms on points of law. Both the registrar and the legal adviser are involved in extensive work with the company law review group. The benefit of the legal adviser position in the CRO is that advice is readily available on the issues that arise daily.</P>
        <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs is an independent statutory officer and as such requires, on occasion, independent legal advice on a range of issues. The office has a consultancy contract with a legal adviser who supports the office on a part-time basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 13(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 provides that the Minister shall appoint to be registrar of the Labour Court a practicing barrister or practicing solicitor of not less than ten years' standing. The registrar holds office on such <Col N="332"/>terms and receives such remuneration as the Minister for Finance determines.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>the estimated cost of the carer&rsquo;s allowance if the carer&rsquo;s means were individually assessed for the payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[14287/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain older people or people with a disability with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. In the course of the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test, account is taken of the claimant&rsquo;s own means and, in the case of a couple, the joint means are assessed. An assumption is made that both members of a couple benefit from the earnings of one or both of them. In this regard, recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance are treated in the same way as recipients of all other social assistance payments. This ensures that resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
        <P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of spouses&rsquo; earnings. Provision was made in budget 2006 to increase the income disregard on the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test to &euro;290 per week for a single person and to &euro;580 per week for a couple from April this year. This ensures that a couple with two children can earn up to &euro;32,925 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance. The same couple may earn up to &euro;54,400 and receive the minimum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2005, there were 24,981 carer&rsquo;s allowances in payment. Of these, almost 91% were in payment at the maximum rate and 9% at reduced rates. The additional cost of paying the maximum rate to those carers who currently receive a reduced rate is estimated to be in the region of &euro;11 million annually. However, there would be considerable knock on effects as such an approach could effectively abolish the means test. I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. Those recommendations involving additional expenditure will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for carer&rsquo;s allowance in respect of two care recipients on 3 March 2006. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test that applies is satisfied. Additionally, the requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes, including carer&rsquo;s allowance, with effect from 1 May 2004.</P>
        <P>On 22 March 2006, to determine if the person concerned satisfies the habitual residence condition, he was requested to complete the relevant departmental form. To date this form has not been received in my Department. A reminder letter issued to him on 18 April 2006. Under social welfare legislation, decisions relating to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 and 450 together.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division <Col N="335"/>of the Health Service Executive. Neither I nor my Department has any function in decisions on individual claims. The executive has confirmed that the person concerned applied for a rent supplement on 28 March 2006 and that a decision on the matter will be made upon receipt of outstanding documentation from the person concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance, BSCFA, scheme is also administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. This scheme assists low-income families with extra costs when children start school each autumn. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year. A person may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing and footwear allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course, and has household income at or below certain specified levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE, Dublin mid-Leinster area, which administers the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme on my behalf, has advised that it has no record of an application from the family concerned. If the person concerned wishes to apply, she should contact the community welfare officer at her local health centre from June onwards to enable her entitlement to an allowance to be determined.</P>
        <P>Normal day-to-day clothing needs are expected to be met from weekly social welfare or HSE payments. However, there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment, ENP, to people in certain circumstances who have clothing needs that they cannot be reasonably expected to meet from their weekly income. The executive has advised that it has no record of an application for such a payment from the family concerned. If the person concerned wishes to apply, she should contact the community welfare officer at her local health centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A grant scheme is available for students in State primary and post-primary schools to help with the cost of school books. The scheme is mainly aimed at pupils from low income families and families experiencing financial hardship. Funding for this scheme is available from the Department of Education and Science and the scheme is administered in each school by the school principal. Parents or guardians in need of such assistance should apply directly to the school principal of the child&rsquo;s school.</P>

	<P>The primary objective of the orphans payments administered by my Department is to provide income support in respect of children whose parents are deceased or who are unable or have failed to provide for them. The weekly rate of payment is &euro;138 per week.</P>
        <P>Foster carers, on the other hand, operate within a very specific framework and the foster care allowance is intended not only to provide income support but to recompense foster carers for the expense incurred in looking after a child who would otherwise be in institutional care. Foster carers are subject to rigorous scrutiny and ongoing monitoring by the health boards and the children in their care are subject to a care plan. The foster care allowance paid by the health boards is paid at a rate of &euro;305 per week, per child under 12 years of age and &euro;332 per week, per child of 12 years and over.</P>
        <P>The two payment systems have significantly different objectives and I do not consider that there is a case for standardising payments in this area.</P>

        <P>The executive has further advised that a rent supplement application was received from the person concerned on 6 October 2005 and that it has been unable to make a decision on this claim, as it has not received sufficient documentation from the person concerned.

	<P>Recipients of social welfare or Health Service Executive payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition, and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This scheme and related supplements are administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive and neither I nor my Department has any function relating to individual claim decisions.</P>
        <P>The HSE west has advised that the person concerned had been prescribed a diabetic diet and applied to the executive for a diet supplement in March 2006. In accordance with the regulations <Col N="338"/>governing the scheme at that time, the amount of diet supplement payable in this case was &euro;54.34, less one third of the applicant&rsquo;s income &mdash; one sixth in the case of a couple. The person concerned did not qualify as one third of her income exceeded the cost of the diet.</P>
        <P>To inform a reappraisal of the scheme, my Department commissioned a study by an expert from the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute. The study examined the special diets prescribed in legislation for which assistance is available through the existing diet supplement scheme. The study also considered the appropriate level of assistance required to cater for any additional costs involved in providing for necessary special diets, relative to the cost of a normal healthy eating diet. This report is the most comprehensive review of specialised diets and food costs that has been carried out in the past decade.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The study recommended a new framework for classifying the various diets and my Department has now finalised a revised diet scheme and regulations, which took account of the findings and recommendations of the study. Under the revised scheme, diabetes is not classified as requiring one of the new prescribed diets but comes within a healthy eating diet which every person is expected to meet from one third of his or her basic payment. The person concerned would not <Col N="339"/>qualify for a diet supplement based on the new diet supplement regulations. The executive has further advised that the person concerned has been informed of her right to appeal the decision to HSE west appeals officer.</P>

        <Quest>the reason the eligibility criteria for persons wishing to avail of the back to work enterprise allowance in the case of recipients of disability allowance is three years while in the case of all other categories the limit has been reduced to two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The qualifying period for people on disability allowance who wish to avail of the back to work enterprise allowance is 12 months. The qualifying period for people on disability benefit is three years. The back to work allowance scheme is part of my Department&rsquo;s programme of initiatives designed to assist long-term unemployed people, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force.</P>
        <P>There are two strands to the scheme, the back to work enterprise allowance for self-employment and the back to work allowance for employees. The allowance was introduced in September 1993 when long-term unemployment stood at 8.9%. In its early years the scheme proved very effective in helping people who had been long-term unemployed to return to the labour force. At present, there are 8,559 participants in the scheme, compared to 39,343 in October 2000 when the scheme reached its peak.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the difficulties being experienced by some people returning to the labour force after three or five years of attachment to the live register, the qualifying period for access to both the employment and self employment strands of back to work was reduced to two years with effect from March 2006. In July 2001, the scheme was extended on a pilot basis &mdash; 200 places &mdash; to those in receipt of disability benefit for at least five years. This was reduced to three years in April 2002. Disability benefit is regarded as a short-term payment where the person is coming from employment. The other qualifying payments such as disability allowance are considered to be longer-term payments. For this reason the qualifying period for participation on the scheme from disability benefit is greater than other categories of social welfare recipients.</P>
        <P>The scheme is continually monitored to ensure its relevance to current labour market conditions and to ensure that it continues to assist those furthest from the labour market to gain a foothold into sustainable employment or self-employment.</P>

	<P>Under standard supplementary welfare allowance rules rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate, towards their accommodation costs.</P>
        <P>Prior to Budget 2006, the person concerned had an income of &euro;186.20 per week after the payment of her rent. Following the application of the budget increases and the increase in her income, arising from the award of one parent family payment, the amount of rent supplement fell but the person concerned has an income of &euro;203.20 per week after the payment of her rent, an overall net increase of &euro;17 per week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my reply to a previous question from the Deputy on 30 March 2006, I informed him that the Health Service Executive was satisfied that the correct amount of rent supplement was paid in this case. The executive has advised that an appeal concerning the rate of rent supplement awarded was received from the person concerned on 21 March 2006. The executive has further advised that the executive&rsquo;s appeals officer has upheld the decision of the executive. Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of the executives appeals officer, the person may appeal this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned was in receipt of rent supplement as a single person.

	<P>The family income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments. FIS is paid on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks, taking into account a family&rsquo;s net earnings and the number of children under 18 or aged between 18 and 22 years and in full time education.</P>
        <P>CE and F&Aacute;S training courses are publicly funded employment and training programmes with the specific objective of progressing the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged people from social welfare dependency towards employment in the open labour market. The workplace scheme, which has now been phased out, enabled participants to gain workplace experience while retaining full social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>As the part-time job incentive scheme applies to people working up to 24 hours, participants may transfer to FIS where the FIS qualifying conditions are met. FIS is designed to encourage people to take up or remain in full-time work in the open labour market in circumstances where dependency on social welfare alone may otherwise appear attractive. Extension of entitlement to people engaged in F&Aacute;S training programmes, community employment or similar schemes would not be consistent with these policy objectives.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive, on my behalf. The commission on financial management and control systems in the health service, which reported in 2003, noted that over the years the health system had been assigned responsibility for a number of services which might be regarded as non-core activities. It recommended that the Government consider assigning non-core activities currently <Col N="343"/>undertaken by agencies within the health service to other bodies.</P>
        <P>The Government subsequently set up an interdepartmental group to examine this issue. The report of the interdepartmental group was accepted by the Government recently. The report recommends, among other things, that income support and maintenance schemes, together with associated resources, should be transferred to my Department. This initiative has been mooted several times in the past and is a logical approach to provision of these services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The transfer would include community welfare officers and others. Given the organisational, human resource and industrial relations implications of the transfer, consultations with all stakeholders will be part of the process to implement the decision. As a first step, a departmental working group has been established to progress implementation of the transfer.</P>
        <P>The changes arising from the decision will have major implications for my Department&rsquo;s existing services and for the future delivery of supplementary welfare allowance. I am confident that this transfer process can be carried out without any negative effect on the standard of service currently provided by community welfare officers, or in the important role that they play in addressing issues of disadvantage in the community.</P>

The setting of waste management charges and the introduction of waivers in respect of waste charges is, as stated by my colleague the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a matter for each local authority.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a national social welfare scheme to address the issue would be complex given the wide range of charging regimes and cost structures that exists in respect of waste management throughout the State. Any system put in place to assist people who rely on private domestic waste collection would have to be sensitive to the different local arrangements. I intend to keep the matter under review and to monitor the experiences of welfare customers under the various charging systems and cost structures.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s central records system, CRS, contains 5.6 million active records. This database has been in existence since 1979. The personal public service, PPS, number, which is widely used to access public services, is the customer identifier in the database. Practically all the population has a PPS number included in the database.</P>
        <P>The CRS database is at the core of all the Department&rsquo;s customer-oriented transactions. Existing customers on the Department&rsquo;s schemes &mdash; circa 900,000 &mdash; are obliged to inform or update the Department of change of address and the address information for this group is likely to be reasonably current. However, the address data for the remaining records on the database may not be as current as there is no legal requirement for an individual to formally maintain official address data.</P>
        <P>Preliminary discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the use of the PPS number on the electoral register have taken place. These have indicated legal, technical and operational issues with the sharing of data. The sharing of databases of personal information between public services agencies can only be done in accordance with legislative provisions and where it is possible to accurately match identity data. Considerable effort has been made by my Department over several years to improve the quality of its identity data.

        <P Just="Left">The basis for the restriction in the new rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence.  A person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Family income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments. FIS is paid on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks, taking into account a family&rsquo;s net earnings and the number of children under 18 or aged between 18 and 22 years and in full-time education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Arrangements already exist whereby self-employed people on low earnings can receive additional payments under the social welfare system. Self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance, UA, appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim assistance. The rate of assistance payable depends on the person&rsquo;s means. In assessing means, account is taken of the net income the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year, and all expenses necessarily incurred by the applicant in carrying out the business are disregarded. In addition, farm assist is payable as an income support for low-income self-employed farmers.</P>
        <P>Any extension of FIS to other categories of persons would have to be considered in a budgetary context. There are no plans for such an extension in present circumstances.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if he plans to establish in law any of the recommendations outlined in the Final Report of the Action Group on Small Powered Rec<Col N="350"/>reational Craft (including Personal Watercraft); and if a deadline will be set for the introduction of these recommendations.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15096/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the action group on small powered recreational craft recommended a number of statutory initiatives. The majority of these initiatives have already been implemented and the position on each is outlined as follows.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P>Definition of personal watercraft, PWC, and fast power craft, FPC: PWC and FPC are defined in the Maritime Safety Act 2005 and in the Pleasure Craft (Personal Flotation Devices and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2005, S.I. 921 of 2005, respectively.</P>
        <P>Identification register of PWC and FPC: a review of the Irish ship registration system, generally, commenced in 2005 and is ongoing. The recommendation on a small vessel register will be considered in the context of this review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Personal flotation devices and age limit of operators of PWC and FPC: in accordance with the Pleasure Craft (Personal Flotation Devices and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2005, SI 921 of 2005, lifejackets/personal flotation devices must be carried. All children up to the age of 16 years are required to wear a lifejacket/personal flotation device, PFD, while on board a pleasure craft. This requirement applies to everyone on board small pleasure craft, under seven metres. In addition, there are age restrictions for the operation of pleasure craft for children under the age of 16.</P>
        <P>By amending the definition of a vessel in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, as amended by the Maritime Safety Act 2005, to include personal watercraft, such craft come within the &ldquo;Rules of Water&rdquo; as recommended by the action group.</P>
        <P>Regulation of the use of intoxicants: the Maritime Safety Act 2005 contains provisions, which enable the restriction of the consumption of alcohol or drugs on board vessels. Such restrictions are included in the Pleasure Craft (Personal Flotation Devices and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2005. In particular, they prohibit the operation of vessels while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Definition of offences of careless and dangerous driving: the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 (Prescribed Classes of Vessels) Regulations 2001, introduced in 2001, prescribed PWC and FPC for the purposes of the careless and dangerous navigation or operation provisions of sections 35 and 36 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992, as inserted by section 44(11) of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000.</P>
        <P>The Maritime Safety Act 2005 also strengthened the law against the improper use of PWC and FPC, in particular by enabling local and harbour authorities to introduce byelaws to regulate their use. The Maritime Safety Directorate has prepared guidelines for the relevant authorities that have powers under the Maritime Safety Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Insurance and competency/training: the action group recognised that competency testing is a complex issue, which it said would require further consideration and it recommended that the issue of insurance cannot be treated in isolation from the overall issue of driver competence. This issue <Col N="352"/>is currently on the Maritime Safety Directorate&rsquo;s work programme.</P>
        <P>Apart from the statutory initiatives outlined, a key element in the programme to enhance safety in the recreational craft area is the publication of a code of practice for the safe operation of recreational craft. The purpose of this code, which follows an extensive consultation process with stakeholders, is to assist owners and operators, together with enforcement authorities, of recreational craft by setting out in one document current legislative requirements relating to recreational craft, in addition to recommended best practice regarding the safe operation of such craft. The final version of the code is currently being published and this is due to be officially launched on 24 May 2006.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is included in the following table which sets out the supervisory driver testers assigned to each region and the test centres in each region where driver testers are headquartered. Driver testers are assigned from headquarter centers to meet the demand in other centers. In addition, there is a chief tester and one supervisory driver tester who works full time as a training and standards co-ordinator.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may require a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle to provide a preliminary breath specimen where the vehicle is involved in a road collision or where a garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed, or where a garda forms the opinion that the person has consumed alcohol.</P>
        <P>The purpose of preliminary roadside breath testing is to provide garda&iacute; with a facility to assist them in determining whether a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle has consumed alcohol. However, the Road Traffic Acts provide that a person may be arrested for a drink driving offence without recourse to a preliminary breath test. In particular, there may be circumstances, especially in the context of a road collision, where it may not be possible for a member of the Garda to require that a person submit to a preliminary breath test.</P>
        <P>Garda discretion in the use of preliminary roadside tests is an integral and important element of the enforcement provisions relating to the laws applying to drink driving and I do not propose to alter that position.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Acts also place an obligation on a person to provide a blood or urine sample in a hospital. This applies where an event occurs involving a vehicle which results in a person being injured, or a person claiming or appearing to have been injured, where the person is admitted to or attends a hospital, and a member of the Garda is of the opinion that, at the time of the event, the person had consumed an intoxicant. An intoxicant includes alcohol and drugs or any combination of alcohol and drugs.</P>

        <Quest>the reason the offence of breach of a three tonne restricted area, which is the subject of an on the spot fine offence, is not included in the range of offences which incur penalty points; and if, in view of the dangers and nuisance posed by such breaches of the three tonne restrictions, he will make the necessary amendments to have this offence included with the other offences which incur penalty points.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The focus of the penalty point system is on road safety. The regulation of the movement of large vehicles by reference to unladen weight entering a road that is applied under Article 17 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, SI No. 182 of 1997, operates as an entry restriction measure as opposed to an entry prohibition measure.</P>
        <P>Restricted entry means that under Article 17 a vehicle whose unladen weight exceeds the weight threshold specified on the regulatory traffic sign at the entrance to a road is still permitted to enter that road for the purposes of gaining access to or egress from premises accessible only from that particular road.</P>
        <P>The driver of a large vehicle that enters the road in breach of that restricted access provision and uses the road instead as a through road to a destination elsewhere commits an offence and is liable to be issued with a fixed charge notice in that regard. Since 3 April 2006, the fixed charge applicable to this offence is &euro;60 if paid within the initial 28-day period or &euro;90 if paid within the following 28-day period.</P>

	<P>The National Safety Council, NSC, as the agency mandated with responsibility for road safety education and information, operates a dedicated penalty point website <i>www.penaltypoints.ie</i>. I understand the website has recently been redesigned-updated in the context of the extension of the penalty point system.</P>
        <P>In addition, the NSC ran a public education/ awareness campaign about the new penalty points offences, which took place from the end of March in the lead up to the 3 April 2006 date for the extension of the penalty points system. The campaign included newspaper advertisements outlining the details of the new offences.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the council is continuing to operate the penalty point advertising campaign, entitled &ldquo;Get the Point, Not the Points&rdquo;, on television, radio and on the road network, to promote awareness amongst road users of the penalty point system.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In line with the Government decision that week I travelled to New York for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festivities over the three-day period 15 to 17 March. The speaking functions I attended included the Jerry McCabe fellowship breakfast at John Jay College, the official opening of the second phase of the New York Irish center in Long Island City, the Shannon Airport/West of Ireland trade and tourism breakfast at the Irish consulate, the Ireland-US Council, the top 100 event, the Co-operation Ireland dinner, the New York mayor&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day breakfast, mass at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, the governor&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day event, the annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade on Fifth Avenue, followed by a function with the Knights of St. Patrick.</P>
        <P>In addition, I participated in a number of press and radio interviews over the course of the three days. I was accompanied by both my private secretary and press officer on these engagements. The full costs for this visit have not yet been finalised.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Statistics relating to road accidents, based on information provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are published by the National Roads Authority, NRA, in its annual road accident facts reports. The most recent report, entitled Road Collision Facts, relates to 2004. That report along with reports relating to previous years is available in the Oireachtas Library and on the NRA website.</P>
        <P>The reports contain a detailed analysis of the collisions which occurred during a particular year and should assist the Deputy in determining some of the details set out in his question. The reports do not contain details of some of the issues raised by the Deputy, including the licence status of drivers involved in collisions, the involvement of drugs and alcohol, and whether vehicles involved in collisions have current national car test certificates or otherwise.</P>

	<P>Preparation and adoption of the heavy goods vehicle, HGV, management strategy to ensure optimum use of the Dublin Port Tunnel by HGV traffic is a matter in the first instance for Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>My officials and I are consulting all stakeholders, including Dublin City Council, to ensure that a co-ordinated strategy is developed for the opening of the Dublin Port Tunnel. The heavy goods vehicle management strategy is an important part of this process and in that context, my Department received a copy of the draft proposals prepared by the Dublin city manager in the matter.</P>
        <P>I understand the HGV management strategy was considered by Dublin City Council on 10 April 2006. At that meeting, the council decided to introduce the strategy with a full extended cordon as and from 1 January 2007. This means that prior to that date, there will be a period available for bedding-in to be allowed. From 1 January 2007, there will be no surface access routes to Dublin port except through the port tunnel between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. each day. I have been advised that the executive of the council is in the process of putting in place arrangements to implement the council decision.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s formal role will be to put in place the necessary regulatory framework relating to traffic and parking management and road signage to support the strategy. This work is under way.</P>

        <P>This programme includes: detailed monthly operational audits of the company&rsquo;s performance; regular controlled checks to ensure that consistent test results are obtained across the NCTS test centre network; each month reviewing the performance of a sample of vehicle testers as they carry out tests; carrying out spot checks without any advance warning on a representative sample of cars that have just undergone the NCT; carrying out detailed interviews with a representative sample of customers to assess customer satis<Col N="364"/>faction levels; and an annual review of the company&rsquo;s overall performance.</P>

        <P>There is a statutory obligation on all licensed operators to ensure that all of the vehicles in their <Col N="365"/>fleet comply fully with the appropriate licensing requirements.

It is not possible to say how many operators have unauthorised vehicles and which have not applied to the Department to have those vehicles licensed.</P>
        <P>Persons engaging bus operators should request from the operator sight of the operator&rsquo;s road passenger transport operator&rsquo;s licence to ensure that the operator holds a valid licence and that the vehicles used in any service are authorised on the licence.

        <P>The penalty point system only allows for the removal of penalty points following a successful late appeal against a conviction for a penalty point offence. However, where penalty points were applied as a result of an administrative error and through no fault of the individual concerned, advice on the removal of penalty points was sought from the office of the Attorney General, who advised that the State should take proactive steps to deal with any error that has occurred, including the repayment of fines and the expunging of penalty points.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, a protocol for amending penalty point records has been put in place with the agreement of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 77 on Tuesday 7 March.</P>
        <P>As I indicated then and previously, the delay in providing driving tests is a matter of regret to me. It not only represents a poor service to the public but it is also hampering the development of initiatives which I wish to pursue and which will contribute further to road safety. The driving test and those who deliver it are a key element in the road safety strategy.</P>
        <P>It is my objective to eliminate the backlog of driving tests by mid-2007 and my Department has developed a package of measures in consultation with staff interests to achieve this.</P>
        <P>Additional staff have been made available to the driving test service. Seven additional testers have been trained and are carrying out tests while the process of recruiting a further ten driver testers is well advanced. Training should commence shortly and these testers will be available for testing this June.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to acknowledge that a very high number of the existing driver testers have indicated that they will participate in a bonus scheme which commenced in February and will make a significant contribution to the reduction of the backlog.</P>
        <P>My Department is still in a position to offer early tests to those applicants requiring an urgent test, once they provide satisfactory documentary evidence of the reason why.</P>
        <P>An important element of the package of measures to reduce the backlog was a proposal to contract out a set of numbers of driving tests. The Civil Service Arbitration Board has determined that, otherwise than by agreement, the contracting out of core work of driver testers to a private firm is not contemplated or permitted by the provisions of paragraph 21.9 or by any other provision of Sustaining Progress. However the board urged a resumption of discussions at which all options &mdash; and it emphasised all options &mdash; should be considered, with a view to ensuring that a solution is implemented without delay. My officials are in discussions with the unions on a way forward with a view to dealing with the backlog by the middle of 2007.</P>

	<P>Over the period 2000-05 a total of more than &euro;740 million has been invested, through the railway safety programme, in the upgrade of the railway network throughout the country including in the BMW region. This has funded the installation of continuous welded rail throughout the network, along with a substantial programme of renewals to bridges and structures, level crossings, cuttings and embankments.</P>
        <P>In addition there has been substantial investment in:signalling systems &mdash; resignalling of the Galway and Sligo lines has been completed and work is under way on the Westport and Ballina lines with completion expected by year-end; road crossing automation; station improvements including platform extensions and upgrade works to improve accessibility; and in rolling stock &mdash; new rolling stock has been provided on the Sligo route and will improve further as Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann takes delivery of 150 intercity railcars over the period 2007-08. Overall almost &euro;290 million has been invested in the upgrade of rail and bus services in the BMW region in the period 2000-05. This, combined with investment in the railway network in the south and east region, has resulted in major improvements in service quality in terms of frequency and reliability.</P>
        <P>In addition to the new rolling stock on order and for delivery over the next few years, Transport 21 provides for an ongoing high level of investment in the railway safety programme and for the development of the railway network generally including, in the case of the BMW region, <Col N="369"/>for the phased re-opening of the western rail corridor.</P>

In July 2005, I announced the award of contracts for the provision of PSO services from 2005 to 2008 on routes linking Dublin with the regional airports in Galway, Sligo, Donegal and Knock in the BMW region. The total maximum contracted subvention for the operation of these particular routes is &euro;29 million over the three-year contract term.</P>
        <P>Under the Transport 21 investment framework, a total of &euro;100 million will be available towards safety related infrastructure and development projects at all the regional airports over the next ten years and a new capital expenditure grant scheme is being finalised for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Under the marketing, safety and security grant scheme the airports in the BMW region have received &euro;4.7 million over the past four years.

	<P>My Department chaired a steering group overseeing a cross-departmental review of road safety expenditure which examined expenditure incurred over the lifetime of the first road safety strategy, 1998-2002. This review seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of all public spending on road safety and, to establish the impact of road safety performance on other areas, such as health and emergency services.</P>
        <P>The steering committee consisted of representatives from the Departments of Transport, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Finance, and Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The committee for public management research was also represented in order to examine processes and outcomes of the review for future cross-departmental reviews and to provide general expert assistance.</P>
        <P>The steering group commenced the review in mid-2003 and the consultants engaged to carry out an analysis of identified expenditure submitted their final report in October 2005. The report was submitted to the committee for public management research for quality assessment in October 2005. The committee for public management research completed the quality assessment in February 2006 and that report was published last week. It is envisaged that the consultants&rsquo; report will be published on the Department of Transport website shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 511 and 512 together.</P>
        <P>Directive 2005/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 relating to the use of frontal protection systems on motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC is required to be transposed into Irish law by 25 August 2006. It lays down technical requirements for the type approval of motor vehicles as regards frontal protection systems supplied as original equipment fitted to vehicles or as separate technical units. New cars and small vans fitted with frontal protection systems which do not comply with the directive may not be allowed registration or entry into service from 25 May 2007.</P>
        <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities Motor Vehicles Type Approval (Amendment)(No.2) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 166 of 2006), regarding type approval of vehicles and component parts.</P>
        <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Passenger Car Entry into Service) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 165 of 2006) regarding entry into service of passenger cars.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to amend the European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Entry into Service) Regulations so as to extend the provisions of the directive to new small vans before 25 August 2006.</P>
        <P>There are no restrictions or prohibitions on the use of frontal protection systems supplied as separate technical units. My Department is considering how best such restrictions may be applied.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The power to make determinations regarding the application of special speed limits in their area through the making of by-laws was devolved to local elected representatives of county councils and city councils under the Road Traffic Act 1994. The exercise of this power is subject to consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, in the case of proposals for the application or revision of speed limits on national roads, is subject to the consent of the National Roads Authority.</P>
        <P>Since 20 January 2005, the councils, when making special speed limit bye-laws are now required, under section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, to have regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister for Transport on the application of special speed limits. It is, however, expressly provided in section 9 that in the case of special speed limits of 120 km/h and of 30 km/h these particular special speed limits can be applied only in accord<Col N="374"/>ance with guidelines issued by the Minister. I issued guidelines in this regard in April 2005.</P>
        <P>It is open to any person to submit a proposal to the city or county council concerned seeking the application or review of a special speed limit at any specified location. The timing of the carrying out of a review of speed limits is, however, a matter for each individual council at local level. There is no procedure that requires a council to carry out such a review on every occasion that requests for reviews are received.</P>
        <P>On the question of public consultation, the Road Traffic Act 2004 introduced a public consultation step that local councils must comply with when making of special speed limit by-laws. This process affords any person the opportunity to submit to the council objections in writing to the draft special speed limit by-laws. The Act provides that the council must consider such objections.</P>

	<P>On 20 February 2006, Antonov RA 82044, operated by Volga DNEPR, landed at Shannon, for a technical stop, flight originating from Russia, en route to Venezuela. The Department received &lsquo;notification only&rsquo; that the flight of aircraft RA 82044 was landing at Shannon.</P>
        <P>Under international aviation rules aircraft making technical stops do not need an authorisation. In Ireland, however, permission is required <Col N="375"/>if munitions are being carried. In the notification the firm in question indicated that &ldquo;no dangerous goods or munitions will be carried on board&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport was notified on 10 February 2006 that the flight on 20 February of aircraft RA 82044 would be landing at Shannon. In the course of inquiries regarding this case the Department became aware that the aircraft was carrying military helicopters.</P>
        <P>In the light of this I have initiated a review of the carriage of munitions and dangerous goods and my Department will consult with Departments and relevant groups as part of this review. The Department of Transport is responsible for authorisation of civil aircraft carrying weapons or munitions of war into or over Ireland. Before issuing an exemption, the Department of Transport consults: the Department of Foreign Affairs, in respect of foreign policy; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding security and the Irish Aviation Authority, regarding aviation safety, and also informs the Department of Defence.</P>
        <P>When any of those agencies has objected to an exemption being given, then an exemption has been refused. The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for regulating the activities of foreign military aircraft landing in, or over-flying Ireland.</P>

	<P>The destination for these flights was the USA. In accordance with the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, aircraft may come into Ireland for technical stops such as for refuelling purposes, without notifying the Department of Transport. The landings at Shannon on the above dates were technical stops. Accordingly no authorisations were required. The other issues referred to in the question are matters for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

        <P>Under Section 19 of the Roads Act 1993, the National Roads Authority, NRA, has responsibility for the provision of facilities for the parking of vehicles on national roads. Under Section 54 of the Roads Act 1993, the NRA has responsibility for the provision of service and rest areas along motorways. It is for the NRA to decide on the exact number and location of such facilities in both cases mentioned above.</P>
        <P>The NRA carried out a review of its policy on the placement of service and rest areas on the major interurban routes. The authority completed this review in January 2006 and has published a policy statement on its website, <i>www.nra.ie</i>.</P>

        <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 70 of 7 March 2006, why there is no evidence that heavy goods vehicles are significantly more involved in road collisions; and the way in which this conclusion has been arrived at.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Statistics relating to road accidents, based on information provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are published by the National Roads Authority, NRA in its annual Road Accident Facts reports. The most recent report, now entitled Road Collision Facts, relates to 2004. That report along with reports relating to previous years are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the NRA website.</P>
        <P>In 2004, there were 334 fatal accidents and 374 fatalities. Goods vehicles were involved in 20% of all collisions during that year. However, an NRA study relating to the number of vehicle kilometres of travel in Ireland in 2001 indicate that the average number of kilometres travelled by goods vehicles is significantly higher than other vehicle types. The average number of vehicle kilometres travelled for all vehicles is 19,947. In the case of goods vehicles, the average number of kilometres travelled is 27,381. There is therefore no evidence that heavy goods vehicles are significantly involved in road collisions, given that they have a significantly greater presence on our roads than other vehicles.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunately the case however, that the consequences resulting from a collision with a heavy goods vehicle are generally more severe than with a smaller type of vehicle.</P>

	<P>The State Airports Act 2004 provides a framework that will allow for an orderly approach to the distribution of the assets of Shannon and Cork Airports in conformity with the capital maintenance provisions of the Companies Act.</P>
        <P>Before any assets can transfer to either Shannon or Cork Airport Authority, both the Minister for Finance and I will have to be satisfied as to the financial and operational readiness of the airport authorities. Under the Act each airport authority is required to prepare a comprehensive business plan and obtain the Minister&rsquo;s approval for these plans prior to the transfer of assets.</P>
        <P>At present, Cork Airport Authority in conjunction with the Dublin Airport Authority and financial advisers is in the process of developing its business plan and appropriate financing proposals for the new Cork Airport development projects in line with the requirements of the Act, the provisions of the Companies Acts and the commercial and financial viability realities of the Dublin Airport Authority and the Cork Airport Authority.</P>
        <P>I await the outcome of this work because of its importance to facilitating the development of a dynamic, independent and financially sustainable Cork Airport. It is important that the debate about Cork Airport&rsquo;s debt does not obscure these major development projects, which are nearing completion at Cork Airport. These projects will effectively deliver a new landside airport and represent the first major upgrading of all facilities since the airport was built in the late 1950s. When completed, the new Cork Airport will have a passenger capacity of 3 million people with the facility to expand to 5 million, when needed. Such facilities will greatly benefit the airport&rsquo;s users but they will have to be funded. In this regard Cork&rsquo;s future as an independent airport will have to take account of a realistic assessment of what is commercially feasible, including the capacity of the airport to contribute to its capital investment programme. The Government objective of airport restructuring under the State Airport Act 2004 must be achieved in a manner that underpins the financial and commercial sustainability of all three State airports.</P>

	<P>The provision of park and ride facilities is an important component in our strategy for attracting people out of private cars and on to public transport. To this end, last summer I approved a Dublin transportation office strategy for rail-based park and ride, which envisages facilities at 22 locations on the existing and proposed rail network within the greater Dublin area. I have also made provision, under Transport 21, for &euro;5 million in capital funding this year for suitable park and ride projects in the greater Dublin area. Arrangements for rail-based park and ride funding will also extend to public transport interchange projects. Capital funding for pilot bus-based park and ride projects will also be considered. There will be no revenue support to subsidise operating costs of park and ride facilities.</P>
        <P>Applications by public bodies for funding for specific park and ride projects will be considered by my Department on a first come, first served basis.

	<P>In 1999-2000 Kerry County Council, funded by my Department, commissioned a study of four strategic Gaeltacht piers at Baile na nGall, Baile an Sceilg, Bun a Bhaile and Brandon to ascertain what improvements would be achievable with an input of &pound;1 million, &euro;1.27 million, at each pier. Following this study, design development was authorised for each pier in question.</P>
        <P>In November 2000 Malachy Walsh and Partners were commissioned to carry out design development for the pier at Brandon. Their report indicated that the funding requirement to carry out appropriate work at Brandon was outside the funding available under my Department&rsquo;s scheme. As agreed by Kerry County Council and my Department, piers were then prioritised for construction works with Baile na nGall first, followed by the two U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach piers namely, Baile an Sceilg and Bun a Bhaile. Construction works at Baile na nGall and Baile an Sceilg have been completed and Bun a Bhaile will be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>No further works have been carried out on the design development at Brandon but I understand from Kerry County Council that a recent underwater survey has indicated that there is now significant underwater damage to the pier and rehabilitation works will be required. These <Col N="384"/>works are being costed by the Council and a proposal will be put to my Department for the works once that process has been finalised.</P>

	<P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 113 of 21 March 2006, I travelled to New Zealand for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations and was accompanied by my wife, the Secretary General of my Department, the private secretary and the media adviser. I attach a comprehensive itinerary for information and the Deputy may wish to note the wide range of Irish groups and interests met with during the trip across New Zealand in Auckland, Tauranga, Christchurch and Wellington; meetings with ministers of the New Zealand Government to discuss rural tourism, including walkways, and with the Chairman of the Maori Language Commission regarding on language issues; my formal presentation to the New Zealand Parliament; the <Col N="385"/>breadth of contacts with local and national representatives throughout New Zealand; key representational work undertaken in respect of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, commencing with the parade in Auckland on 11 March and continuing daily throughout the visit; attendance at a consular reception in Auckland on 17 March, attended by Minister Clayton Cosgrove MP on behalf of the Prime Minister, Members of Parliament, and representatives of the diplomatic corps, public and business life and extensive media coverage, including interviews on national television.</P>
        <P>There is great potential to enhance economic and cultural ties between us &mdash; total trade with New Zealand in 2004 was valued at &euro;83 million and many New Zealanders claim Irish ancestry. Approximately 26,000 visitors from New Zealand visited Ireland in 2005 and their stays tended to be above average in duration, encompassing visits to the regions as well as Dublin.</P>
        <P>The cost of the trip, to date, is of the order of &euro;36,000. Further costs, primarily relating to transport within New Zealand remain outstanding. Against this background, and matters of common interest which we share, the visit was worthwhile and will help reap considerable benefits for the State and was value for money.</P>

        <P>The tapering of the adult dependant payments in respect of qualified adults has also been removed and has been replaced by a full qualified payment where earnings are below the upper threshold of &euro;240 per week.

Following an application for authorisation, the European Food Safety Authority published an opinion in September 2004 concerning the use of formal<Col N="393"/>dehyde in feed for fattening chickens. Despite this opinion, which was mostly favourable, the Commission expressed concerns about the use of the additive and referred the matter for further scientific evaluation.

The brief outlines the requirements for office staff, laboratories, visitor areas and general service areas for the new laboratory complex. Given the complexity of the facility, that brief is preliminary and will be adjusted as specific requirements are finalised. This preliminary brief will, however, allow the OPW to source a site for the facility. The OPW is actively seeking a site for the facility and my Department is in ongoing contact with it in this regard. There have been 82 applications to the central applications facility, CAF, for relocation to Macroom.</P>

	<P>Forestry is promoted through the provision of a comprehensive package of incentives and supports, through funding for Teagasc and COFORD, and through focused promotional campaigns.</P>
        <P>The current package of incentives and supports combines 100% grants for planting and attractive premiums of up to &euro;500 per hectare, payable for 20 years for farmers and 15 years for non-farmers. Farmers can plant up to 50% of their land and still draw down the full single payment, as well as the forestry premium. All income earned from commercial woodlands, including the premium, is exempt from tax. Financial support is also available for the growing forest in the form of grants for the shaping and pruning operations, and for forest roads.</P>
        <P>With regard to afforestation on the western seaboard and elsewhere, it should be noted that all grant aid is contingent on the land being able to grow a commercial crop of trees. It is also important to note that all afforestation must have regard to broader environmental considerations.</P>
        <P>On the question of paper manufacture, there is no paper making facility in the State and most of the material produced here is used in wood processing and construction. Wood energy is now beginning to offer real potential as an outlet for forestry production. Our main wood species, Sitka Spruce, is suitable for paper production.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 564 to 566, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In so far as inspections under the single payment scheme are concerned, the regulations state that notification may be given where the purpose of the inspection is not jeopardised, but such notification must be limited to a maximum 48 hours where eligibility checking or cross-compliance checking on the identification and registration of animals is part of the inspection. However, no advance notification limit is specified where other cross-compliance checks are involved.</P>
        <P>Where an on-farm inspection under the single payment scheme does not involve an eligibility check and involves cross-compliance checks other than identification and registration of animals, my Department will give 14 days advance notice of the inspection.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed, in the charter of rights for farmers, to pursuing, with the European Commission, the question of allowing 14 days advance notice for all inspections. My officials have already raised this matter with the Commission but the Commission has indicated that it is unwilling to introduce any changes in this regard.</P>
        <P>The EU regulations governing the cross-compliance sanctions system sets out a range of per<Col N="400"/>centage reductions. For infringement of a legal standard a 3% reduction is proposed but this could be reduced to 1% or increased to 5% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the infringement. If the non-compliance were repeated a multiplier of three must be applied. In the case of intentional infringement a 20% reduction is provided for but this could be reduced to 15% or increased to 100% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the infringement.</P>
        <P>My Department engaged in intensive negotiations with the farming bodies on the implementation of cross-compliance under the single payment scheme in the context of drawing up a new charter of rights for farmers on the delivery of all of my Department&rsquo;s schemes and services.</P>
        <P>In putting in place the inspection system under the single payment scheme, particular attention was given to ensuring that: procedures are fair, equitable and proportional; and the system is standardised to the maximum extent possible across all areas of the country. To achieve these objectives it was necessary to put in place mechanisms that will take due account of whether any non-compliance found is: (a) on its own minor in nature; (b) negligent; or (c) intentional.</P>
        <P>The sanctions system that has been introduced for inspections is clearly set out in the charter of rights for farmers. Tolerances are applied for minor infringements which, on their own, are regarded as inadvertent breaches capable of occurring in practical farming situations.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for consideration of her circumstances under the <i>force majeure</i>-exceptional circumstances measure of the single payment scheme. This application and subsequent appeal were both deemed unsuccessful as the medical evidence furnished related to circumstances that commenced in the mid-1990&rsquo;s and were not considered to have resulted in a drop in production in terms of the premia and arable aid schemes during the reference years. However, it was noted that she had sold her milk quota into re-structuring and purchased suckler cow quota and as such she was advised to submit an application for consideration of her circumstances under the national reserve measure of the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>The person named subsequently applied to the single payment scheme national reserve 2005 under categories B and C. Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 <Col N="401"/>October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. The person named applied to be considered under section (ii) of category B on the basis that she purchased suckler cow quota rights in one or more of the scheme years 2001, 2002, or 2003.</P>
        <P>Category C caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold their milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial.</P>
        <P>Formal letters setting out my Department&rsquo;s decision have issued to the person named. However, should she be dissatisfied with my Department&rsquo;s decision she will be given the opportunity to appeal this decision to the Independent Payment Appeals Committee, Government Buildings, Old Abbeyleix Road, Portlaoise, County Laois.</P>

        <Quest>the amount she has paid out on advertising the milk quota restructuring for 2006; her views on whether her new proposal for milk quota sales through agents, marts and so on will virtually kill off this proposal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2006 milk quota restructuring scheme is the second year of a two-year restructuring programme. The public notice announcing the 2006 scheme was published in four national newspapers and the direct cost of this amounted to &euro;13,708.23 including VAT.</P>
        <P>In March I announced my intention to move to a more open market system for transferring milk quotas, which will come into effect on 1 April 2007. I made this decision because the current restructuring model will not meet the future needs of the industry and a more effective response is required to meet future competitive pressures. The timing of this announcement was deliberate so that farmers would be aware, in advance of this year&rsquo;s restructuring scheme, that the current model would be altered in succeeding years. In waiting a year to implement this policy I am respecting the commitment I gave in 2005 to a two-year programme, ending in March 2007. This also allows for a full examination of options <Col N="402"/>for dealing with the issues raised following the completion of the first stage of consultations with the farm organisations.</P>

	<P>The person named is an applicant under the farm waste management scheme. To qualify for the top-up grant for young farmers, an application must be received by my Department within a period of five years from the date on which he-she is first issued with a herd number or other Department identifier. This is a requirement of the EU provisions governing the scheme and I have no flexibility in regard to the matter.</P>
        <P>This applicant applied under the previous version of the farm waste management scheme and was approved for a grant of 55%, including the young farmer top-up grant, as his application was received within the period of five years referred to above. He then applied on 6 April 2006 for the higher grant rates applicable under the revised farm waste management scheme introduced by my Department on 24 March 2006. As the period of five years has now elapsed, however, he is eligible only for the new standard grant-rate of 60% provided for in the revised scheme.</P>

	<P>At present there are six non-EU countries authorised by the Commission as having equivalent production rules and controls to the EU for certain categories of organic product. These products, provided they have been inspected and certified by an approved inspection body in the country of origin, may be brought freely into the EU and marketed as organic.</P>
        <P>For all other third country imports, authorisation is granted, on a case-by-case basis, by the relevant competent authority, which in Ireland is my Department. An importer must be registered with a competent EU authority and subject to an inspection by an approved EU organic inspection body in the country of import. Registered importers must complete an application form and provide supporting documentation that will demonstrate that the products to be imported were produced to rules equivalent to those laid down in Articles 6 and 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91, which deals with the organic sector; were subject to inspection measures of equivalent effectiveness to those laid down in Articles 8 and 9 of the Council Regulation; and that such inspec<Col N="404"/>tion measures will be permanently and effectively applied.</P>
        <P>The member state must notify the Commission and the other member states of the third countries and products for which it has issued an authorisation. The products cannot be imported without this authorisation. The majority of third country imports are not imported directly into Ireland so the authorisations are made by the member state where the product is imported to first. To date, ten import authorisations have been granted by my Department and no organic product has been refused entry into Ireland.</P>

	<P>The matter referred to by the Deputy was reported to my Department through the avian influenza helpline around midday on Sunday morning, 9 April, when a call for assistance was received from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which indicated that the bird&rsquo;s injuries arose from a collision with a Luas tram. It is important to understand that my Department does not have a function in the collection and treatment of wild birds injured in this way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The swan was brought alive by a member of the Garda to the UCD Veterinary College, pet emergency hospital, and euthanised there on welfare grounds. Tests for avian influenza were subsequently carried out at the Department&rsquo;s central veterinary research laboratory and were completed on 13 April with negative results. I have no information with regard to the details of the scene of the accident.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that my Department&rsquo;s function in wild birds involves the collection and testing of dead birds of certain limited species such as waterfowl in the context of surveillance for avian influenza as these pose the greatest threat of the introduction of the disease.</P>

	<P>An application under the single payment scheme was received from the person named on 13 May 2005. Under EU legislation, to draw down the full single payment, an applicant must declare an eligible hectare to accompany each entitlement. The person named had established 51.65 entitlements, to which a further 26.10 entitlements were added, following the acceptance of his private contract clause application. However, as the person named only declared 51.65 hectares on his 2005 single payment application, the payment, which is due to issue shortly, will be in respect of 51.65 entitlements. As the entitlements transferred in under the private contract clause facility are of a higher value, these will be paid in full, with the balance of the payment comprising 25.55 of the original entitlements.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted two applications under the 2004 special beef premium scheme in respect of a total of nineteen animals. The first application, in respect of ten animals, was received on 4 May 2004 and the second application, in respect of nine animals, was received on 7 January 2005.</P>
        <P>Following computer validation, it was found that eight of the animals on the second application were non-CMMS compliant, that is, they were not recorded as being in the herd of the person named on the date of receipt of the application by the Department, a regulatory requirement of the special beef premium scheme. The ninth animal was found to have died prior to application. Under the governing regulations, the eight non-CMMS compliant animals were liable to be rejected, that is, not paid premium and a reduction penalty applied to other premia payments to the person named. The ninth animal was not eligible for payment and was deleted as an innocent error.</P>
        <P>Following review, the matter of the eight non-CMMS compliant animals has been resolved satisfactorily and the eight animals in question have been processed for payment. The closing date for the 2004 scheme was 31 December 2004 and, as this application was received on 7 January 2005, there is a 4% late penalty, a 1% reduction per working day after the deadline, to be applied. A cheque for &euro;1,612.80, representing payment in respect of eight bulls with the late application penalty, will shortly issue to the person named.</P>
        <P>There is also an outstanding 40% balancing payment in respect of the ten animals in the first 2004 special beef premium application of the person named.

The person named is also eligible for <Col N="413"/>extensification premium, at a rate of &euro;80 per animal, in respect of all animals for which special beef premium has been paid. Having taken the late application penalty into account the extensification premium will result in a payment of &euro;1,414.40 and this will issue shortly. These payments were initially not made to the person named, as the penalty in respect of the non-CMMS compliant animals applied across all schemes.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for the transfer of entitlements by way of inheritance under the single payment scheme. Following processing of that application, the person named was notified on 20 January 2006 of the decision, that as the lands were leased, the entitlements could not be transferred by way of gift or inheritance. An application form for the transfer of entitlements by way of private contract clause was forwarded to the person named for completion. The application has been returned and is being examined. Once a decision has been made, the applicant will be immediately notified.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application under the single payment scheme on 4 May 2005. While the herd number quoted had established 102.97 entitlements, payment in the amount of &euro;6,989.15 in respect of only 65.85 entitlements issued on 22 December 2005. This reflected the total forage area of 65.85 hectares entered on his 2005 single payment application.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted an application on 30 December 2005 to consolidate his entitlements under the consolidation measure of the single payment scheme. This application has been processed and is eligible for consolidation. However, only 26.25 hectares of the 37.12 hectare shortfall can be accounted for as land farmed during the reference period and now no longer available due to an expired rental agreement. A letter issued to the person named on 3 March 2006 explaining the position and requesting him to confirm whether or not he wishes to proceed with his consolidation application. This confirmation is necessary because if the consolidation application proceeds, 10.87 hectares of consolidated entitlements in respect of lands not declared on the 2005 single payment application will immediately revert to the national reserve. The single payment will issue to the person named when the completed confirmation form is returned to my Department.</P>

Having examined the circumstances and documentation submitted, it was deemed that the application was successful and satisfied the criteria laid down in Article 40 of Council Regulation EC No. 1782/2003, determining force majeure-exceptional circumstances. The best possible option under the<i> force majeure</i> measure was applied in respect of the single payment entitlements for the person named. However, he was advised that there were no circumstances under the<i> force majeure</i> measure that provided for the allocation of additional entitlements regardless of the circumstances. He was further advised to consider submitting an application under the national reserve scheme.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 single payment scheme national reserve under categories B and C. Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. Category C which caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, participated in the milk quota restructuring scheme and who converted to a farming sector for which a direct payment under the livestock and-or arable aid premium schemes would have been payable during the period 2000-02. It should be noted however that the rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him/her.</P>

	<P>The Garda Commissioner, in a comprehensive submission to me on the Garda reserve, has proposed that the powers of reserve members will be confined to the enforcement of certain aspects of the following Acts: under the Road Traffic Acts &mdash; demanding driving licences and insurance details, enforcing the wearing of seat belts, etc.; under the Public Order Act &mdash; dealing with the offences of intoxication, threatening behaviour, disorderly conduct and failure to comply with the direction of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act &mdash; dealing with the offences of theft and burglary. Reserve members would also be given the power of arrest under the Criminal Law Act 1997, which provides powers of arrest for both members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilians.</P>
        <P>The additional resource of a well-trained Garda reserve with carefully selected powers and duties will very significantly increase the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat crime and disorder and provide the public with the security and safety it rightly demands. As regards the role of reserve members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the establishment of a transport police, the position is that under section 15 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for the establishment of a Garda reserve, the powers and duties of reserve members may be determined by the Garda Commissioner. I am informed by the Garda authorities that currently there are no proposals to establish a transport police under the new Garda reserve.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 616 and 717 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a transparent statutory framework governing the asylum determination process in Ireland set out in the Refugee Act 1996. The 1996 Act established two independent statutory offices to consider applications and appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The asylum process now in place in this State is comprehensive and compares well with other industrialised countries. Indeed this fact was recently acknowledged by a former UNHCR representative to Ireland who is quoted as stating that Ireland is now a model for the new member states of the European Union and that &ldquo;we now have a system which, in many respects, is one of the best in Europe&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The processing of asylum applications within the framework of the Refugee Act 1996, in particular, has due regard to the definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in section 2 of that Act, which states that a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; is:</P>
        <P LI="1">a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</P><Col N="422"/>
        <P FLI="0">Every asylum applicant is guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. Each application is assessed on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to both the subjective elements, the applicant&rsquo;s own account or personal history, and objective elements, up to date information on the applicant&rsquo;s country or place of origin. This country of origin information comes from a wide variety of sources, including organisations such as the UNHCR, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the UK Home Office, the Canadian International Refugee Board, the US State Department and other EU member states, as well as media and Internet sources.</P>
        <P>Our system also guarantees every asylum applicant a right of appeal to a statutorily independent and separate body &mdash; the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Every asylum applicant is also guaranteed access to legal assistance provided by the Refugee Legal Service. The Deputy should also be aware that the UNHCR is given full access to our refugee determination process and can examine any case at any time to ensure fair procedures and compliance with our Geneva Convention obligations.</P>
        <P>In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about figures relating to the number of girls and women who may cite gender-related persecution in respect of their asylum application, I am advised that the current management information systems in operation in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal do not provide for the compilation of statistics in respect of the different types of persecution. However, work is now ongoing on the development of a comprehensive management and statistical information system for both organisations as part of the development of a new computer system for the asylum and immigration process generally. When this system is in place in 2007, it should be possible to generate the type of information requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I would also point out that all staff working in the asylum area, including reception and interviewing personnel, have completed appropriate training courses and have received and continue to receive on an ongoing basis &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; experience and training in respect of interviews, assessment, decision making, asylum procedures and appeals. These training programmes have been agreed with the UNHCR and delivered by a combination of experienced personnel, including UNHCR training specialists, as well as asylum experts from other countries and other agencies with the specialist skills required. The training provided includes procedures to be followed when dealing with sensitive matters such as gender issues and victims of trauma and violence. I am confident, accordingly, that asylum applications from vulnerable people are dealt with <Col N="423"/>appropriately and sensitively by properly trained and resourced staff.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 617 and 718 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware, there is a statutory framework in place, as set out in the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, governing the asylum determination process in Ireland. This Act, <i>inter alia</i>, provided for the establishment of two statutory independent offices to consider asylum applications and appeals and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether refugee status should be granted or refused in each individual case. These offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The processing of applications within the framework of the Act referred to has due regard for the definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; as set out in section 2 of that Act, which states that a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; is:</P>
        <P LI="1">a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Every asylum applicant is guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. Each asylum application is assessed on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case, which includes consideration of the risk of gender-based persecution where this is advanced as part of an applicant&rsquo;s claims. Due regard is also given to the subjective elements, that is, the applicant&rsquo;s own account or personal history and the objective elements, that is, up to date information on the applicant&rsquo;s country or place of origin of the applicant&rsquo;s claims. This country of origin information comes from a wide variety of sources, including the UNHCR, Amnesty International, <Col N="424"/>Human Rights Watch, UK Home Office reports, the Canadian International Refugee Board, US State Department reports, other EU member states, media and Internet sources and any other available reputable information sources.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal also consider the well-foundedness of each individual applicant&rsquo;s claims, that is, whether there are sufficient facts to support a finding that, if returned to his or her country of origin, an applicant would face a serious risk of persecution. The credibility of an applicant&rsquo;s claims is also central to assessing any application and it falls to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to determine whether an applicant&rsquo;s account is credible and whether he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution for one of the reasons set out in the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, that is, on account of the person&rsquo;s race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
        <P>Issues of relevance in assessing credibility would include contradictions or inconsistencies, the plausibility of the applicant&rsquo;s claims and the level of detail in the claims made. A negative finding as to overall credibility will generally lead to a conclusion that the applicant does not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.</P>
        <P>This State&rsquo;s refugee status determination system also guarantees every asylum applicant a right of appeal to a statutorily independent and separate body, namely the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Every asylum applicant is also guaranteed access to legal assistance provided by the Refugee Legal Service or through a private legal representative, if preferred.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should also note that the UNHCR, the internationally recognised experts in the refugee determination area, is given full access to the State&rsquo;s refugee status determination processes and can examine any case at any time to ensure fair procedures and compliance with our Geneva Convention obligations.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, in determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State to a failed asylum applicant, I must have regard for the eleven factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. I must also have regard for the provisions of section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of refoulement before signing a deportation order. This means in essence that the safety of returning a person to their country of origin, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order. The term <i>refoulement</i> means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a <Col N="425"/>particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating, in each individual case, the safety of making returns to third countries. The effect of a deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. The enforcement of deportation orders is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In light of the comprehensive nature of this State&rsquo;s refugee status determination processes, I am satisfied that the asylum claims advanced by asylum seeking girls and women at risk of violence in their home countries are fully examined in every individual case, having due regard for the merits of each specific case. Equally, I am satisfied that the provisions of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, provide safeguards to ensure that persons at risk of violence, including girls and women, are not returned to their countries of origin where such a risk is found to exist.</P>

        <Quest>the entitlements in respect of paternity leave; if consideration can or will be taken to amend or increase same in line with current maternity leave entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is currently no statutory entitlement to paternity leave. However, many employers in both the public and private sectors have arrangements in place providing short periods of paid paternity leave. Paternity leave was considered in the context of a review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 conducted by a working group chaired by my Department. The working group comprised the social partners, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority. The report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 was published on 29 April 2002 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.justice.ie</i>, and in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>In considering the matter, the working group took into account the reconciliation of work and family life and balanced participation of men and women in work and family life, the cost to employers and the comparative situation in EU member states. While acknowledging that a statutory arrangement to provide an entitlement to time off for fathers at the time of childbirth would enhance arrangements for the reconciliation of work and family life, the working group could not reach consensus on the issue.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, no agreement was reached on paternity leave by the social partners in the context of the negotiations on the Sustaining Pro<Col N="426"/>gress partnership agreement. There are no plans at present to introduce a statutory entitlement to paternity leave.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 619 and 620 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the manner of operation of the working group on domestic partnership is a matter for itself under its terms of reference which charge the group with preparing an options paper on domestic partnership for presentation to me on 20 October 2006.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference are to consider the categories of partnerships and relationships outside of marriage to which legal effect and recognition might be accorded, consistent with constitutional provisions, and to identify options as to how and to what extent legal recognition could be given to those alternative forms of partnership entered into outside the State. The group is to take into account models in place in other countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I can say that the working group will obviously be taking into account, among other matters, the report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution on the family which has scheduled to it the text of submissions made to the committee by various organisations, groups and individuals. The group will therefore have ready access to these submissions should it wish to avail of them.</P>
        <P>The deadline of 28 April 2006 for receipt of submissions was set by the group and, again, it is for the group to decide whether any extension of that deadline will be allowed. The group&rsquo;s terms of reference and contact details for its secretariat are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.justice.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31 March 2006 was 12,439. This compares with a total strength of 10,702, all ranks, as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737 or 16.2% in the personnel strength of the force during that period.</P>
        <P>I am further advised that the personnel strength, all ranks, of Tallaght Garda station as at 31 March 2006 was 170. This compares with an equivalent figure of 133 as at 31 December 1997, and represents an increase of 37 or 27.8% in that period.</P>
        <P>Garda management advise that the number of members who sought transfers from Tallaght Garda station in 2005 and whose transfer requests have not yet been acceded to is five. A total of 21 garda&iacute;, all at Garda rank, were transferred out of Tallaght Garda station in 2005. These garda&iacute; were either appointed to a national unit, following successful participation in a competition, or facilitated with a transfer to another Garda station. A total of 19 probationer garda&iacute; were allocated directly from the Garda College to the station and one garda transferred into the station.</P>
        <P>I should also say that the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a <Col N="428"/>further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007 by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Tallaght Garda station will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

The issue of reducing opening hours is a matter for local Garda management while any proposal to cease stationing members in a Garda station must be included in a draft annual policing plan in accordance with section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</P>

        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.</P>

	<P>The procurement of a managed digital radio service is being undertaken by the Department of Finance on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other blue light services and some non-commercial public bodies. An EU-based restricted tender procedure is currently underway and the first stage of short-listing suppliers has been completed. It is planned that tender documents will be issued to these suppliers in the coming weeks. While the exact timeframe for rollout will be subject to contract negotiations with the successful bidder, the implementation of the new service is planned to commence later this year.</P>

        <Quest>his views on the implications of the findings of the Breaking Down Barriers report recently commissioned by Amnesty International specifically with regard to the view expressed in the aftermath of the report&rsquo;s being published that Ireland was in the dark ages in respect of its treatment of racism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government takes very seriously its role in the development of a caring, tolerant and fair society through the implementation of appropriate policies. With regard to combating racism and managing diversity, this Government has already set out its policy in the national action plan against racism, NPAR.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NPAR is a comprehensive statement of the Government&rsquo;s anti-racism and diversity policy. It recognises that racism can take many and overlapping forms and specifically identifies institutional or systemic racism as one such form. It underpins the existing legislative and administrative framework on equality matters. The basis for implementation is a whole of Government approach &mdash; mainstreaming intercultural policy developments across a range of activity &mdash; and identifying five key objectives of protection, economic and social inclusion, service provision, recognition and participation. Hardly a week goes by without the commencement of an initiative associated with the plan as dynamically steered by the chair of the steering group, Lucy Gaffney.</P>
        <P>I might add that, in telling contrast to the report to which the Deputy refers, the NPAR is the result of an extensive consultation process overseen by a national steering group, which included social partner organisations, Government Departments, specialised and expert bodies and a wide range of civil society groups working with cultural and ethnic minorities. The implementation of the NPAR is being monitored by a strategic group representative of these very same stakeholders.</P><Col N="433"/>
        <P>Given these developments, I totally reject the comments referred to by the Deputy that Ireland is in the dark ages in respect of its treatment of racism. I respectfully suggest that the only one in the dark ages is the author of those comments. Certainly, no credible commentator on the Irish situation would have made such a statement. It is not, as far as I am aware, something which appears in the report itself.</P>
        <P>Indeed, the UN Committee for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, UNCERD, in its concluding observations on Ireland&rsquo;s first and second report on the implementation of that convention welcomed, in particular, the launch of the NPAR; the establishment of several independent institutions with competence in the field of human rights and racial discrimination; Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive legislative framework in the anti-discrimination area; and the wide-ranging consultations with civil society groups in the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s first and second national report to the UNCERD committee and noted the positive working relations that exist between Government, independent national bodies established in the human rights and anti-discrimination area and civil society groups.</P>
        <P>Ireland is one of the few countries to have produced a national action plan against racism. The European monitoring centre against racism and xenophobia regards Ireland as being one of only six member states which maintained a comprehensive system that adequately reveals the extent and nature of racist violence in their society.</P>
        <P>I take issue with many of the conclusions of the Breaking Down Barriers report. Many of the recommendations in the report are already comprehensively addressed in the NPAR. As always, my Department is happy to consider new ideas in respect of tackling racism and building an inclusive society, issues which are of the highest priority for the Government.</P>

The Deputy will be cognisant of the predicament and sensitivities of categorising a cohort of people by virtue of what they are not, that is, citizens of Ireland. The Deputy will also be aware of the problem that alternative phrases which may be acceptable at present could also be viewed, in time, as pejorative terms which are inconsistent with the spirit of inclusiveness and tolerance which we wish our immigration system to reflect.</P>

        <P>The radio system in Ennis will be replaced by the new system.

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources that, with the exception of Claremorris, there are no Garda district patrol cars of 1.4 litre capacity. The district of Claremorris currently has two 1.4 litre patrol cars. These cars are due to be replaced in the next year. A total of 65 out of 109 Garda districts have 1.8 litre cars. All remaining districts, excluding Claremorris, have 1.6 litre cars. I have been further informed that all these 1.6 litre cars will be replaced by 1.8 litre cars over the next 18 months. The 1.4 litre patrol cars are used for Garda sub-district patrols in outlying areas or otherwise used as back up for the Garda district patrol cars.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources including personnel, that the personnel strength of all ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31 March 2006 was 12,439. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 of all ranks as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737, 16.2%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of additional garda&iacute; recruited into the Garda traffic corps since 1 January 2006 as at 24 April 2006 was 61 of all ranks, giving a total strength of 630 of all ranks on that date. It is anticipated that a total of 244 garda&iacute; of all ranks will be allocated to the Garda traffic corps in 2006, bringing the total complement of the corps to 805 by the end of the year. Between now and 2008, the traffic corps will increase its numbers to a complement of 1,200. Garda management has been advised by the director of training and development that all existing members and new recruits to the Garda traffic corps have successfully completed the two week standard car driving course.</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P>Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. I should also say that the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government&rsquo;s approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007 by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.</P>

        <P>The Garda Commissioner is fully aware that I will continue to provide the necessary resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as requested by him, to enable them to carry out their duties in relation to our traffic laws.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are three types of breathalysers in use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &mdash; the blow-in-the-bag alcolyser, the alcometer, both of which are used for roadside breath testing, and the intoxilyser, which is installed in a number of Garda stations. The alcolyser and alcometer test for the presence of alcohol in the breath. The intoxilyser evidential breath testing instrument tests the driver&rsquo;s breath for the level of alcohol and <Col N="442"/>eliminates the need for a doctor to take a blood or urine sample.</P>
        <P>As at 5 April 2006, there are 2,160 members of the force trained in the use of the roadside breathalyser and 1,752 members trained in the use of the intoxilyser. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that training in the use of the roadside breathalyser and the intoxilyser continues on an ongoing basis. Training in the use of the roadside breathalyser forms part of the student training programme for all garda&iacute; in Templemore. At present, there are 390 alcometers on issue to members in Garda district headquarters as well as the blow-in-the-bag type, which are on issue in every Garda station. The breakdown of alcometers per Garda district is set out in the following table:</P>

        <P>In the meantime, an implementation group is in place and working to assist and advise on preparations for the new authority. Acquisition of suitable premises is being progressed through the Office of Public Works. A competition for the appointment of the director of the national property services regulatory authority was advertised recently by the Public Appointments Service with a closing date of 23 March 2006. The Public Appointments Service is in the process of finalising arrangements for the interview board to sit and it is anticipated that interviews will be held in the near future. The staffing arrangements for the office will be reviewed with the director once he or she has been appointed.</P>

	<P>The application referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department on 6 September 2005. The decision of the visa officer to refuse this application was made on 16 September 2005. The application was refused because the visa officer was not satisfied that the <Col N="448"/>applicant&rsquo;s family had sufficient financial resources to support him. In addition, the visa officer considered that the granting of a visa could result in a cost to public funds or resources. There is no record of an appeal lodged with my Department. All appeals must be received within two months of the date of the initial refusal. As the time for receipt of such an appeal has now elapsed, it is open to the applicant to make a fresh application.</P>

	<P>The person concerned entered the State as an unaccompanied minor in October 1999 and applied for asylum. Normal immigration controls were not applied to her and her entry to the State without a passport or valid form of identification was allowed for the sole purpose of having an asylum claim determined. In May 2000, she withdrew her claim for asylum before it had been finalised and made an application for leave to remain based on her parentage of an Irish born child. She was granted leave to remain on this basis on 8 October 2002.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. Those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age or, by way of exception, be a minor born in the State, be of good character, have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years, intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>In May 2004, the person concerned applied for a certificate of naturalisation. The person concerned had not been resident in the State for five years at the time she applied and, consequently, her application was deemed ineligible. She was informed of this decision and the basis for it in writing in February 2006. In the context of naturalisation certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an <Col N="449"/>applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996. The person in question was seeking recognition as a refugee from October 1999 to May 2000 and did not have permission to remain in the State from May 2000 to October 2002, when she was granted leave to remain. Consequently, she will have the necessary five years reckonable residence in October 2007, provided she has maintained her permission without any gaps since October 2002. She can submit another application at that time and this will be assessed against the requirements of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel throughout and within divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.

The phased increase in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of this year.

        <Quest>his views on the need <Col N="451"/>for the introduction of mandatory minimum sentencing as the norm in new legislation to allay the concern of the public, which feels that the Judiciary pursues an excessively lenient sentencing policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[14624/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down by law the maximum penalty appropriate to a particular offence and for the courts, having considered all the circumstances of a case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum. This approach reflects the doctrine of the separation of powers &mdash; the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Legislature lays down the possible punishment range but it is for the courts to exercise discretion in deciding the punishment while taking account of all the circumstances of the case and of the offender.</P>
        <P>However, there are a small number of situations where statute has intervened to create exceptions to this approach. In the case of murder, there is a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. The Criminal Justice Act 1999 provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment for an offence of possessing drugs to the value of &euro;13,000 or more for the purposes of unlawful sale or supply unless exceptional and specific circumstances exist in respect of the offence or the offender that would make it unjust in all the circumstances to impose a sentence of not less than ten years.</P>
        <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission in its report on sentencing in August 1996, which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Nevertheless, I intend to add to the exceptions that I have mentioned above by means of Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. My proposals include a new offence of importation of drugs to the value of &euro;13,000 or more that will attract the ten year mandatory minimum sentence and provision for mandatory minimum sentences of between five and ten years for certain firearm offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, use or production of a firearm to resist arrest, and modification of firearms such as sawing off a shotgun.</P>
        <P>I have tabled these proposals because I believe that the increasingly adverse impact of these offences on our communities is such as to merit the Oireachtas providing sentencing guidelines to <Col N="452"/>the courts to the effect that a specified minimum sentence should be imposed unless to do so would be unjust in all the circumstances. In addition, I intend to provide that when considering whether the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence would be unjust the courts may not only have regard as at present to certain mitigating factors such as the stage at which the offender pleaded guilty and whether the offender materially assisted in the investigation but also to the public interest in preventing these offences and to whether the offender has been previously convicted in respect of these offences.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, I do not consider that the Judiciary can be said to be pursuing an excessively lenient sentencing policy. While this may be the public perception based on a small number of cases that have been the subject of media attention, I do not believe that this perception reflects the reality. Having regard to the multitudinous variety of circumstances in which offences are committed and of offenders, the trial judge is best placed, having heard the evidence, to select an appropriate sanction from a punishment range laid down by the Oireachtas. I consider that this approach should continue to be the norm.</P>

The search proved negative and a standard letter, which has been approved by the Data Protection Commissioner, issued to the applicant. This letter states, <i>inter alia</i>, that the document does not constitute a &ldquo;proof of no convictions&rdquo;, &ldquo;police certificate&rdquo;, Garda &ldquo;reference&rdquo; or Garda &ldquo;clearance&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The reason for this is that searches carried out in response to such requests are conducted solely in respect of the name, date of birth and address as provided by the applicant and not on any variants of these details. Unlike criminal record vetting, which is only available to specified organisations, details of possible variant matches are not provided under the data protection search process. This procedure reflects the purpose of data protection legislation, which is not a means of vetting but is designed to protect individuals with regard to the automatic processing of their personal data.</P>

        <P>When assessing the applications in question, consideration was given to the personal circumstances of the applicants and the extent of their ties to their country of origin.

For the reasons set out in my previous reply, the applicant does not meet the criteria for the granting of permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements and his application was refused on that basis.

	<P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda authorities that if documents were forged in any part of the EU and then knowingly used in the Republic of Ireland for financial gain, it would be a criminal act. The matter would be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the investigation file submitted to the law officers. The case would then be adjudicated upon to establish if sufficient evidence is available to substantiate the offences of forging and-or uttering.</P>
        <P>In the case referred to, consideration was also given by investigating garda&iacute; to the Land Registry <Col N="459"/>Rules, the Registration of Title Act 1964 and the Conveyancing Act 1881, under which it is the vendor&rsquo;s signature that effectively passes title. The purchaser&rsquo;s signature is solely for the purpose of certifying that the purchaser is an Irish citizen and, as such, is a qualified person under the provisions of the Land Act 1965. The Garda investigation into the complaint made by the person referred to did not establish the presence of the necessary proofs to warrant a prosecution in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have no role in the investigation or prosecution of cases. This is a long standing principle of our system of justice. The role of the Garda is to investigate alleged offences, gather whatever evidence may be available and submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The question of whether a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP. The director, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and-or statute law. In the circumstances, it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment further on the case.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Kilkenny is one of the 11 remaining locations nationwide that form part of the Garda CCTV programme. Following recommendations from the Garda authorities, I have approved the implementation of six new Garda CCTV systems. With the addition of these six new locations, a total of 17 Garda town centre CCTV systems including Kilkenny will be implemented in the following locations &mdash; Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. The answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector. In recent months, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has conducted a thorough examination of all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems. Following this review, I have recently received a comprehensive and innovative proposal for the project management and the outsourced service provision of Garda CCTV systems, including Kilkenny, from the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda authorities wish to commence the initial public procurement process and I am also anxious to proceed urgently with this comprehensive request for tender to source the best CCTV service possible for Kilkenny and the other 16 locations selected. This will happen in conjunction with section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV in public places. My Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract the project managers and outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems. My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Kilkenny and in the other locations, at the earliest opportunity subject to compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.</P>

	<P>Holders of C visas who wish to extend their stay are advised by the visa section of my Department that they must leave the State and reapply for a new appropriate visa. The person concerned was granted a C visit visa to enter the State for a period of three months. It now appears that she is seeking an extension of her permission to remain in the State. An examination of the papers in respect of the case indicates that the person concerned sought an extension of her C visit visa with the immigration division of my Department and was refused. Notification of this decision issued on the 31 March 2006.</P>
        <P>A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form. That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted. Every visa applicant is required to state on the application form the dates on which he or she proposes to enter and leave Ireland. He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete. A C visa is granted for visits of less than 90 days. As a consequence, it is not the general policy to extend <Col N="463"/>permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. The person concerned must leave and reapply from outside the State should she wish to return. She should include in her new visa application the purpose and duration of her intended stay.</P>

Part of its function under the Act is to licence companies and persons providing a whole range of security services.

I understand that the authority proposed to licence all other sectors of the industry on a phased basis thereafter.</P>
        <P>It was intended to introduce licensing of the cash movement sector at the end of a voluntary compliance period where the industry would be given time within which to bring its standards up to the requisite approved standards, which would form the basis for licensing. The incidents to which the Deputy refers highlighted to me that a radical lapse in standards had occurred. As a result, the chief executive of the Private Security Authority has advised me that she will table proposals for the introduction of mandatory licensing of this sector as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>Under section 15 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for the establishment of a Garda reserve, the powers and duties of reserve members may be determined by the Garda Commissioner. The Garda Commissioner, in a comprehensive submission to me on the Garda reserve, has proposed that the initial duties of a reserve Garda will include road traffic checkpoint duties accompanied by a full-time member. I have said that I am extremely impressed with the comprehensive nature of the proposals for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reserve made to me by the Garda Commissioner.

	<P>For the first time, the Garda Commissioner provided statistics on headline offences committed by persons who were recorded as being on bail at the time the offence was committed in his 2004 annual report. These figures show that 5% of headline offences were committed by persons on bail. Provisional figures for 2005 indicate that 5.36% of headline offences were committed by persons on bail.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision of this information as a contribution to public discussion. The statistics in the Commissioner&rsquo;s report classify offences committed while on bail under the ten headline crime groups under which the report&rsquo;s statistics <Col N="467"/>are categorised. It is important to note that all offences in, for example, the homicide group are not the homicide offences of murder and manslaughter. The homicide group of headline offences also includes the offences of attempted murder, murder threats, infanticide, abortion and procuring or assisting in an abortion.</P>
        <P>In respect of bail in general, during the term of office of the rainbow coalition, the number of prisoners on temporary release reached an all time high of 20% at one stage. As a result of the action of this Government, the so-called revolving door system operated by the rainbow coalition has been stopped and the percentage of the prison population on temporary release is approximately 2.3%. I would also point out that, while it is disturbing that offences are committed by persons on bail, the offence for which the person received bail may be a minor one.</P>
        <P>Our legislative provisions for the granting of bail are very stringent. The 16th amendment of the Constitution provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. The Bail Act 1997 gave effect to the amendment and tightened up the bail regime generally. Furthermore, the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed shall be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence. The granting of bail in accordance with the Act, the amount of bail and sentencing are matters for the courts, which are &mdash; subject only to the Constitution and the law &mdash; independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</P>
        <P>I have requested that the empirical evidence which is available be examined to ascertain the extent of the problem. I believe that an evaluation of how the Bail Act has been operated since enactment should also be carried out and I am arranging for this to be done.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 6 May 2002 and was issued with a work permit valid from 25 June 2003 to 24 June 2004. He applied for asylum on 2 February 2004. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the <Col N="468"/>Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 16 March 2006 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned. This person&rsquo;s case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).

	<P>The Garda Commissioner, in a comprehensive submission to me on the Garda reserve, has proposed that the powers of reserve members will be confined to the enforcement of certain aspects of a number of Acts. Under the Road Traffic Acts, powers may be exercised in demanding driving licences and insurance details, enforcing the wearing of seat belts, etc. Under the Public Order Act, powers may be exercised in dealing with the offences of intoxication, threatening behaviour, disorderly conduct and failure to comply with the direction of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, powers may be exercised in dealing with the offences of theft and burglary. Reserve members would also be given the power of arrest under the Criminal Law Act 1997, which provides powers of arrest for both members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilians.</P>
        <P>The additional resource of a well trained Garda reserve with carefully selected powers and duties will significantly increase the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat crime and disorder and provide the public with the security and safety they rightly demand. As regards the role of reserve members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the matter referred to by the Deputy, the position is that under section 15 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for the establishment of a Garda reserve, the powers and duties of reserve members may be determined by the Garda Commissioner.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled, including where the applicant has had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.</P>
        <P>In the context of qualifying residence for the purposes of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996. Generally speaking, immigration stamps in an applicant&rsquo;s passport are used to determine periods of permission to remain in the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since 1 April 2005, the practices for processing applications for naturalisation have changed. When an application for naturalisation is received, it is examined immediately to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria. If the applicant does not meet the residency requirements, he or she will be informed immediately. Since the introduction of this procedure, more than 1,400 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible. All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to <Col N="471"/>reapply when they have the required residency. The onus is on the individual who requires permission to remain in the State to keep this permission up to date at all times. If a person is required to have the permission of the Minister to remain in the State and he or she does not obtain or renew that permission as applicable, that person is staying in the State illegally and is in breach of Irish immigration law. He or she may ultimately be subject to deportation proceedings.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that I can waive some or all of the statutory requirements at my absolute discretion in certain circumstances, I consider it would be inappropriate to exercise my discretion in circumstances such as those outlined by the Deputy to facilitate persons who are in breach of immigration law.</P>

        <P>This decision was appealed by the legal representative of the person concerned. Following a re-examination of the application, it was noted that the person concerned was naturalised in July 2001 and became an Irish citizen at that time. Under section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996 only refugees may apply to have family members join them in the State. The legal representative of the person concerned was informed of this on 14 March 2005. As such the person in question has no entitlement to make an application for family reunification.</P>

	<P>Before dealing with the specific case of the persons concerned, I would like to explain briefly the workings of the Dublin II regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003. This regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of &ldquo;asylum shopping&rdquo; across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which member state is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one state. At the same time, it guarantees asylum applicants that one state will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of &ldquo;refugees in orbit&rdquo;, a situation which had pertained in Europe prior to the introduction in 1995 of its predecessor, namely the Dublin Convention.</P>
        <P>Under the Dublin Convention and now the Dublin II regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner can, on the basis of the relevant criteria, request another state to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other state.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of the case of the persons concerned, a husband and wife, they both lodged asylum claims in this State on 8 December 2005. Following investigation, it was determined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II regulation, the United Kingdom was the appropriate state to process their applications as they had already made asylum claims there on 28 September 2004, albeit under different names, nationalities and dates of birth. The persons concerned were offered an opportunity to appeal the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which they duly did on 10 April 2006 through their legal representatives, and their appeal, which has non-suspensive effect, is still ongoing.</P>
        <P>The United Kingdom accepted responsibility for the cases of the persons concerned with the consequence that transfer orders were signed in respect of them on 31 March 2006. These orders issued to the persons concerned on 4 April 2006 requiring them to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Monday, 10 April 2006. They presented as requested on that occasion and in accordance with the transfer orders signed in respect of them and the Dublin <Col N="475"/>II regulation, they were duly transferred to the United Kingdom on 13 April 2006.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the Deputy shares my abhorrence of the practice of people trafficking. The tackling of such practices requires co-operation between states, particularly within the EU. It can reasonably be contended that the proper operation of the Dublin II regulations inhibits the practice of people trafficking. The clear spirit and intent of the Dublin II regulation is to have an asylum application examined in the state where such a claim was first lodged, which is what happened here. A system in which persons can move from state to state within the EU claiming asylum would recreate the phenomenon of &ldquo;asylum shopping&rdquo;, which would benefit only people traffickers.</P>

	<P>The reception and integration agency, RIA, is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers through the policy of direct provision and dispersal. The RIA operates a transfer system for direct provision residents. All asylum seekers accommodated by the RIA are aware of this arrangement and can channel any transfer requests directly to the RIA through this system.</P>
        <P>The lady in question gave birth on 27 April 2005 and has been resident at the RIA accommodation centre at the Eyre Powell Hotel, Newbridge since May 2005. I understand the RIA has recently received a request for a transfer to accommodation closer to maternity services from this lady on the grounds that she is pregnant again and needs to be re-accommodated in Dublin city.</P>
        <P>The medical correspondence referred to by the Deputy relates to her previous pregnancy. The lady has not provided the RIA with any up to date correspondence from the Rotunda Hospital or any other maternity service to support her transfer request. Her request will be considered as soon as appropriate documentation is received by the RIA.</P>

	<P>The current position is that members of ranks in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up to and including inspector,who were recruited to the force prior to 1 April 2004, must retire at 57 years of age. Members recruited after that date may serve until 60, subject to an annual check after the age of 55 on fitness to serve.</P>
        <P>In the context of the establishment of a Garda reserve, I have said that I see merit in considering an increase in the retirement age of pre-2004 members of garda, sergeant and inspector ranks from 57 to 60 to facilitate the supervision and mentoring of reserve members by members of those ranks. I will discuss this with the Commissioner as part of the wider preparations for the establishment of the reserve.</P>

I am further informed that the change of practice has the full support of the Law Society&rsquo;s conveyancing committee.

        <P>When assessing any visa application, the visa officer will consider various matters, including whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicants would fully honour the conditions of the visa. The visa officer will also have regard to information provided and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in their country of origin. The applications in question were refused because the visa officer could not be satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa. In addition, it was felt that the applicants had not displayed sufficient evidence of obligations to return home following the proposed visit.</P>
        <P>Appeals against the initial refusal decisions were received on 20 March 2006. Following a re-examination of the applications, the decisions to refuse were upheld on 31 March 2006.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The information required by the Deputy in so far as the dates of appointment of former members and the remuneration paid to each of them in each of the years since their appointment is concerned, is set out at Table 1 and Table 2 below. Members of the tribunal are appointed for a term of three years which may be renewed.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory independent body established under the Refugee Act 1996 in order to deal with appeals against negative recommendations in respect of applications for refugee status issued by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC. The tribunal has been in operation since November 2000 and is comprised of a full-time chairperson <Col N="482"/>and 33 part-time members. The tribunal has undertaken a significant job of work since its establishment and had taken some 23,107 decisions up to the end of 2005. It has also tackled the number of appeals on hand on an ongoing basis. It has moved from a situation where it had some 2,596 appeals to clear on 31 January 2004, some 990 of which were six months old, to a situation at the end of March 2006 where it had 1,614 appeals on hand, 421 of which were more than six months old.</P>
        <P>In line with the general downwards trend in asylum applications from, for example, 11,634 in 2002 to 4,323 in 2005, the cost of the operation of the tribunal can also be expected to continue to fall. This will allow the continued redeployment of resources from the asylum process to support the capacity of the Irish naturalisation and immigration service, INIS, to enhance service provision in the area of immigration, visas, citizenship etc., as well as increasing the number of persons found not to have a protection need being returned to their country of origin.</P><Col N="481"/>

        <Quest>the training and resources which are given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to comply with its responsibilities as detailed in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 427 of 7 March 2006; and if he is satisfied that the Garda has the skills necessary to determine cruelty relating to exotic animals.</Quest>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 are the principal statutes which prohibit the maltreatment of animals. Section 11 of the 1911 Act extended only to domestic or captive animals. However, section 13(<i>a</i>) of the 1965 Act extended the definition to include all wild animals. By virtue of these provisions, it is unlawful to commit acts of cruelty against any animal.</P>
        <P>The responsibility for pursuing complaints of cruelty rests with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. On receipt of such a complaint, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a statutory basis on which to investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal. Garda management states it is satisfied that its members are aware of their roles and responsibilities under the Acts.</P>

	<P>I have no current proposals for changes in legislative provisions relating to the sale of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday which have their origin in the Licensing (Ireland) Act 1833. However the matter can be debated further in the context of the sale of alcohol Bill which will repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004 and is due for publication later this year. I should add that the response to last year&rsquo;s consultation process on the draft Bill did not indicate a substantial demand for changes to existing provisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources including personnel, that the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31 March 2006 was 12,439. This compares with a total strength of 10,702, all ranks, as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737, or 16.2%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed that the personnel strength of Glengarriff Garda station as at 25 April 2006 was one sergeant and one garda. Garda management states that there is no proposal to downgrade Glengarriff Garda station. It will remain as a sub-district station and there will be personnel attached to it.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division in order to provide the best possible service to the public throughout his or her division. In this regard, personnel assigned throughout the division together with the overall strategic and operational strategy are continually monitored and reviewed.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
        <P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 <Col N="487"/>Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and in this context, the needs of Glengarriff Garda station will be given full consideration.</P>

        <P>I will attend the Justice and Home Affairs Council which will take place in Luxembourg later this week. In that context, my general approach to the discussions will be to support the development of co-operation at EU level in line with the EU treaties. For me, this is particularly important when it comes to strengthening operational co-operation in the fight against terrorism and other forms of serious crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the items on the Council agenda, I should mention that many of the proposals have already been through the procedures provided for under the European Communities (Scrutiny) Act 2002. Additionally, a number of them have been the subject of specific presentations to Members of the Oireachtas. Moreover, Oireachtas approval will be required before Ireland can agree to the adoption of the legislative texts of the proposed framework decisions.</P>
        <P>The general situation with regard to the relevant dossiers is that they are, for the most part, the subject of ongoing negotiations. In addition, it is the case that some of the items concerned have been placed on the agenda for information purposes. This includes the question of the adoption of a list of safe countries of origin where a proposal is expected to be introduced by the Commission in the near future.</P>
        <P>I would, in particular, like to express my support for the current text of the proposed <Col N="490"/>framework decision on the European evidence warrant. This is an initiative which appears to be close to conclusion and I am hopeful that it can be finalised at an early stage.</P>
        <P>As far as the Schengen Convention is concerned, I would like to reiterate that Ireland has successfully applied to operate elements of the Schengen arrangements which are not concerned with the abolition of border checks. The approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be necessary in that connection. Accordingly, a motion seeking such approval will be introduced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the CCTV advisory committee, that was established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on CCTV matters, has received a report from the Chief Superintendent of the Dublin metropolitan region, north central division, which outlines the CCTV requirements of the division. In this report recommendations were made for the installation of CCTV cameras in the Benburb Street, north quays and Manor Street areas. The report has been considered by the CCTV advisory committee which is currently in consultation with the divisional officer for the Dublin metropolitan region north central division with a view to establishing the priority areas for the installation of CCTV cameras in that region.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I launched the community based CCTV scheme last year in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems. The purpose of the scheme is to support local communities who wish to install and maintain CCTV security systems in their area, with the aim of increasing public safety and reducing the risk of anti-social and criminal <Col N="491"/>activity. The closing date for receipt of applications was 20 September 2005.</P>
        <P>Under this scheme, communities could apply for grant aid funding of up to &euro;100,000 from the Department to install a CCTV system in their area. In addition, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs gave a commitment to provide successful applicants from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of &euro;100,000 subject to the total grant aid from both Departments not exceeding &euro;200,000 or 100% of the capital costs of the project, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>The community based CCTV scheme offered two stages or options that were designed to meet the requirements of communities in both of these situations. Stage 1 offered pre-development supports and possible funding for organisations or groups which were not yet ready to develop their proposals fully or utilise funds. The stage 2 process offered a direct application process to access funds to those organisations which could demonstrate an ability to develop and deliver a CCTV programme immediately.</P>
        <P>More than &euro;1 million in grant aid has already been allocated to 37 communities under the scheme and many of these could see their CCTV systems in operation before the end of the year. I plan to make a further call for proposals under the scheme in the coming months and it is open to community groups in the Stoneybatter area to submit an application for funding under the scheme when it is announced.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Directive 2006/24/EC of 15 March 2006, on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks, applies to the EU member states only.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the EU-US informal high level meeting on freedom, security and justice held on 2 and 3 March 2006, the US indicated that it was considering approaching each member state to ensure that the data collected on the basis of the aforementioned directive be accessible to them.

	<P>The draft framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the context of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters determines common standards to ensure the protection of individuals&rsquo; personal data. The proposal applies to the sharing of information between member states&rsquo; law enforcement agencies for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences. Ireland broadly supports the thrust of the framework decision. However, in the context of combating organised and other crime, in particular terrorism, trafficking in persons, offences against children, illicit drug trafficking, illicit arms trafficking, corruption and fraud, we are anxious to ensure that a proper balance is struck between ensuring the effective transfer of data between the various law enforcement authorities and protecting individual privacy rights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards the EU-US informal high level meeting on freedom, security and justice on 2 and 3 March 2006 in Vienna, in the course of discussions the EU Presidency indicated that agreements already concluded would not be affected by the framework decision. Negotiations on the framework decision are at a very early stage in the Council working group, the multidisciplinary group on organised crime, mixed committee, and the framework decision is unlikely to be adopted for some time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 751, 806, 878 and 879 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Advisory Committee for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing was established in December 2001. The committee held 38 meetings over a three-year period as well as a number of other meetings at sub-committee stage. From an early stage in the committee&rsquo;s deliberations, it became apparent that there were divergent views among representatives of deaf and hearing persons and their families on approaches to the teaching of the deaf and hard of hearing. The opposing <Col N="497"/>viewpoints made it difficult for the committee to reach decisions. Indeed in some cases, decisions arrived at sub-committee stage were challenged at plenary level by members who were involved in the decisions of the sub-committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While various chapters of the committee&rsquo;s report were drafted, including chapters on early intervention, primary education, post-primary education, visiting teacher service and communication issues, no consensus was reached on any of these due to the divergent views of members of the committee. In order to progress matters, and as two previous deadlines which had been set for the report&rsquo;s finalisation had not been met, my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, met the committee in June 2004. At that meeting, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stressed that its report should be completed by October 2004. This did not happen.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances and following consultations between my officials and the chairperson of the committee, I formed the view that there was no prospect of the advisory committee reaching an agreed position in the foreseeable future. Given this position, I wrote to the chairperson of the committee and informed her of my decision to disband it.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that it was not possible for the committee to complete its work but the reality was that, over three years after its establishment, there was no prospect of it doing so. Rather than continue down the cul-de-sac that the committee&rsquo;s work had become, I have decided that a different approach is required which includes involving the national council for special education which has a remit to advise my Department on policy matters.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the national council for special education, which has a research function and part of whose remit is to advise my Department on policy matters will be in a position, after undertaking appropriate research and analysis of this matter, to advise my Department on policy and other issues relating to the education of deaf and hard of hearing pupils. Indeed, I understand from the NCSE work is progressing on this issue and I am satisfied that this important issue in receiving appropriate attention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to Irish sign language, ISL, I wish to advise the Deputies that ISL has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998. Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. This includes provision for students learning through ISL.</P><Col N="498"/>
        <P>A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include the following. The special schools for the deaf in Cabra, Dublin, have been encouraged in regard to the use of sign language in class. In-service training is provided in the use of ISL. My Department has provided funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children-pupils, their siblings and parents.</P>
        <P>My Department has sanctioned a pre-school for deaf children on a pilot basis. Programmes are delivered through the medium of ISL as a first language. My Department also provides funding towards ISL tuition to the siblings of the children enrolled.</P>
        <P>My Department, through the Higher Education Authority, has established and fully funds a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College, Dublin, which provides diploma courses for ISL-English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bilingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions-group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for adult education, recently launched the first in a series of instructional DVDs. These DVDs were developed by the Irish Deaf Society with funding from the Department of Education and Science, under the Education Equality Initiative, which provides pilot funding for innovative projects aimed at adults who are educationally disadvantaged. This is the first in a series that will provide instruction in English through ISL to deaf adults. Funding covers the period 2004 to 2006 and is assisted by the European Structural Funds.</P>
        <P>My officials will be in contact with the two groups in question concerning their request for a meeting.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 752, 753, 819, 823, 841 and 844 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputies will be aware that in accordance with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education. This will provide for a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most. The maintenance grants are reviewed annually and improvements made as necessary, having regard to available resources.</P>
        <P>I attach particular importance to the issue of the quality and timeliness of information for students in regard to the financial supports which may be available to them. A number of initiatives have been taken by my Department in this regard, including the issuing of an information sheet direct to each CAO applicant. I have also asked the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education to review existing information strategies and to bring forward proposals for <Col N="500"/>additional initiatives which I expect to have in the near future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the future administration of the schemes, as I indicated previously, my Department has been engaged in substantial consultations with the key stakeholders in order to map the most logical and effective arrangements for the future structure and administration of the student support schemes. These discussions have substantially clarified the positions of the various stakeholders and interest groups in regard to the future administration possibilities for student support. I expect to be in a position in the coming weeks to decide on a strategy, having regard to the many and complex issues involved, to give effect to the programme for Government commitment to the payment of the maintenance grants through a unified and flexible payment scheme. The arrangements to be put in place will involve clearly defined targets for the delivery of a quality and timely service to applicants for maintenance grants, including the expeditious payment of grants to applicants who comply with the terms of the schemes. The arrangements for the future administration will be provided for in new statutory framework through a student support Bill. I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval in the near future for the drafting of the Bill.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 754, 755, 758, 814, 821, 822, 830, 840, 846, 847, 854, 865 to 867, inclusive, 869 and 871 together.</P>
        <P>The new DEIS programme will be of huge benefit to schools in Mayo. I am sure the Deputies would agree that it is important to make sure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities get all the extra support possible and will welcome the extra resources that DEIS will provide for Mayo schools. I can assure the Deputies that there is no reason for schools that have not been identified for the new programme to worry as they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils. Not one of these schools has been told they will lose any resources as a result of DEIS.</P>
        <P>DEIS is designed to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available. Over the years, no less than eight separate schemes for disadvantaged primary schools have been put in place. Some schools were benefiting from just one or two of these and others were benefiting from more. The DEIS initiative is designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from a comprehensive package of supports, while ensuring that others continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The additionality in DEIS for second level schools is evident from the fact that approximately 40% of the 200 second level schools that will benefit from the school support programme were not getting any support under the three existing schemes. Now they will get a wide range of extra supports. No school has been told that they are going to lose resources. On the contrary, four urban-town primary schools, 59 rural primary schools and six second level schools in Mayo have been invited to benefit from all the resources available from the new programme. <Col N="504"/>Indeed, almost 20% of all the rural schools invited to benefit from the new programme nationally are in Mayo.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputies will agree that the extra supports being made available will be of great value to those schools in Mayo which, based on the information submitted by their principals, have been selected to benefit from the new programme.</P>
        <P>While the whole rationale behind the new programme is to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from all of the available supports, schools that are benefiting from existing schemes will keep the extra resources &mdash; financial and human &mdash; that they are getting under these initiatives for the 2006-07 school year. After that they will continue to get support in line with the level of socio-economic disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
        <P>A review process has been put in place for primary and second level schools that did not qualify for participation in the new school support programme, SSP, and that regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31 March 2006.</P>
        <P>In regard to how schools were identified to benefit from the new programme, this process was managed by the educational research centre, ERC, on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.</P>
        <P>The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the school support programme. The variables involved were as follows: % unemployment; % local authority accommodation; % lone parenthood; % Travellers; % large families (five or more children); % pupils eligible for free books. In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally held data from the post-primary pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the school support programme were as follows: medical card data for junior certificate candidates, including junior certificate school programme candidates; junior certificate retention rates by school; junior <Col N="505"/>certificate examination results aggregated to school level, expressed as an OPS; &ldquo;Overall Performance Scale&rdquo;&mdash; score, and this was based on each student&rsquo;s performance in the seven subjects in which she or he performed best; leaving certificate retention rates by school.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 756, 757, 864 and 868 together.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the new school support programme under DEIS has now been completed. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new programme. These comprise 640 primary schools &mdash; 320 urban-town schools and 320 rural schools &mdash; and 200 second-level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Four urban-town primary schools, 59 rural primary schools and six second level schools in County Mayo have been invited to participate in the new school support programme.</P>
        <P>The identification process was managed by the educational research centre, ERC, on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. The ERC&rsquo;s overall approach was <Col N="506"/>guided by the definition of educational disadvantage in section 32(9) of the Education Act 1998 as &ldquo;the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools&rdquo;. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey of all primary schools in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.</P>
        <P>The analysis of the survey returns by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools<?oasys _jy ?>for participation in the school support programme. The variables involved are as follows: % unemployment; % local authority accommodation; % lone parenthood; % Travellers; % large families (five or more children); % pupils eligible for free books.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of second-level schools, my Department supplied the ERC with centrally held data from the post-primary pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the school support programme were as follows: medical card data for junior certificate candidates, including junior certificate school programme candidates; junior certificate retention rates by school; junior certificate examination results aggregated to school level, expressed as an OPS &mdash;&ldquo;Overall Performance Scale&rdquo;&mdash; score, and this was based on each student&rsquo;s performance in the seven subjects in which he or she performed best;leaving certificate retention rates by school.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. This mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications was 31 March 2006. It is anticipated that the review process will be completed by the end of the current school year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am satisfied that the method adopted by the ERC in identifying levels of disadvantage in primary and second level schools is the most appropriate and effective approach currently available. The future development of pupil-student databases at primary and further education level and the continuing development of the existing post-primary pupils database and student databases in higher education institutions, all using the personal public service number, will further enhance the identification process for future planning cycles. These <Col N="507"/>developments will also facilitate co-operation with other Departments and agencies in identifying levels of disadvantage in schools.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Our schools promote, support and encourage healthy eating and physical exercise in a range of ways. All second level schools have been required to provide social, personal and health education as part of the junior cycle curriculum since September 2003. The aims of this programme include preparing students for responsible decision-making and promoting their physical, mental and emotional health and well-being. It aims to make students aware of the elements of a balanced diet and the importance of healthy eating for physical and mental well-being and also to develop awareness of the importance of rest and exercise for health and well-being.</P>
        <P>Physical education is also part of the curriculum and plays a key role not just in giving students an opportunity to exercise during the school day but also in encouraging a positive attitude towards physical activity which students will hopefully carry with them into adult life.</P>
        <P>Apart from curricular provision, schools can implement measures to encourage physical activity during school breaks and schools already play a major role in promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland and the Football Association of Ireland, provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>Together, the above initiatives ensure that students not only get opportunities to exercise at school but also learn about balanced nutrition and making good food choices. Schools are playing their part in terms of promoting a healthy diet and adequate physical exercise for students. However, it is important to remember that <Col N="509"/>students spend just 20% of their waking hours at school, therefore, schools can only do so much with regard to promoting exercise and healthy eating and the main role must rest with parents.</P>

	<P>The review of youth information provision, which is being carried out by A&amp;L Goodbody Consulting, commenced in June 2005. The estimated cost of the review is &euro;64,130. Discussions between my Department and the consultants are at an advanced stage with a view to finalising the report. Following these discussions the youth information steering group &mdash; a sub-committee of the national youth work advisory committee- will review the final document to ensure that the terms of reference have been appropriately dealt with by the consultants.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the national youth work advisory committee or NYWAC will then consider the contents of the report and that the report, together with any views of the NYWAC, will be presented for my consideration. Following due consideration of all aspects of the report, including financial aspects, decisions in relation to the implementation of findings and the publication of the review will then be made.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the school transport service on <Col N="517"/>behalf of my Department. More than 135,000 children are carried on school transport services each day to primary and post-primary schools including about 8,000 children with special educational needs. The cost of transporting children with special educational needs, including grants, now accounts for about 33% of the overall allocation for school transport. The allocation for school transport in 2006 is &euro;152 million.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann endeavours to provide the best possible transport service for children with special needs. The size of vehicle required is determined by the number of special needs pupils requiring the service and the suitability of the vehicle to meet the requirements of the pupil. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not always possible to facilitate a child, by virtue of his or her special needs, on a regular school transport service. Furthermore, many children with special needs travel long distances from home to school, and individual school transport, such as a taxi service, may be deemed to be the most suitable and appropriate mode of transport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the education sector, vetting is available in respect of prospective employees of children in detention schools, as well as special needs assistants and bus escorts accompanying children with special needs. My colleague Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for State with responsibility for children, announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the Garda central vetting unit, which has been relocated to Thurles under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, to ensure it can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children, whether on a full-time or part-time basis.</P>
        <P>My Department allocates funding to schools to enable them to employ escorts on school transport services. These escorts are specifically engaged by the schools to cater for children with special educational needs whose care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support. These escorts are a valuable service for children with special needs who require assistance.</P>

	<P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the <Col N="519"/>scheme, an approved course is defined as either a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration, or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution. Since the inception of the higher education grants scheme in 1968, students pursuing postgraduate courses at approved colleges in Ireland and Northern Ireland can apply for grants in respect of their fees, subject to the prescribed maximum fee limit, under the grants scheme. The prescribed maximum fee limit is kept under review. It was increased to &euro;5,380 for the current academic year, from &euro;5,028 in 2004-05.</P>
        <P>In 1996-97 my Department&rsquo;s student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in other EU member states. The courses must be followed in a university or third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. The extension of the schemes at that time did not extend to courses at postgraduate level.</P>
        <P>Any extension to the scope of the grants scheme, to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses in private colleges or colleges in all other EU member states can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector. There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes for postgraduate study.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission <Col N="520"/>has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including issuing the results of examinations and determining procedures to enable the review and appeal of results of examinations at the request of candidates. Notwithstanding this, as I informed the Deputy on 20 October 2005 in response to similar questions on this issue, I had inquiries made with the State Examinations Commission and was advised as follows.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The results of the leaving certificate which issue from the commission in August of each year are provisional only, as is clearly stated in correspondence. The objective of the State Examinations Commission is to ensure that the processing of results is as free from error as possible. The leaving certificate examinations cover 375,000 grades to 57,000 candidates involving 3,000 examiners. Recognising the inevitable problems that can arise in a system of this size, a transparent, easily accessible and effective appeals process is available to all candidates who are unhappy with their results </P>
        <P>The appeal process involves candidates viewing their scripts to see how marking schemes were applied. In 2005, this was completed on 2 and 3 of September. The closing date for receipt of appeal applications in 2005 was 7 September. The results of the appeals, some 11,500 in all, issued on 12 October 2005, some five weeks later, during which time the physical re-marking of the appeal scripts took place. During this limited timeframe, examination scripts had to be retrieved from schools, distributed to examiners, fully re-marked by appeal examiners, monitored in at least 20% of cases by appeal advisers, and returned to the State Examinations Commission for results processing.</P>
        <P>It is acknowledged in examination systems all over the world that some level of error may occur. It is for that reason that national examination systems must have effective appeal processes. The Irish system is a world leader in terms of giving candidates an opportunity to view their scripts before deciding whether or not to appeal. Another comparable strength of the appeal system is that a full re-marking, as distinct from a check of mark addition, takes place. On balance it is considered that it is better to have a comprehensive, quality appeal system that takes some time to execute rather than to prejudice quality by a less comprehensive, speedier process.</P>
        <P>Offers of third level places are made by the CAO on the basis of the provisional results issued in August. There are good reasons they do this because to delay the offering of places until the appeals process is completed would impact upon the start date for the academic year and thus disadvantage the overwhelming majority of candidates whose provisional results are their final results. The State Examinations Commission makes every effort to process the results of appeals as quickly as possible in order to facilitate <Col N="521"/>the college entry process balanced with the need to allow the appeal examiners sufficient time to carry out a thorough re-marking of candidates&rsquo; work.</P>

	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special <Col N="523"/>educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment. As the Deputy is aware, enormous progress has been made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At second level, approximately 1,654 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers who were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,102 whole time equivalent special needs assistants or SNAs in our second level schools.</P>
        <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities or special needs.</P>
        <P>The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities-special needs. The responsibilities of the NCSE include deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level, on applications for special needs assistant or SNA hours, and processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser or SENO will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school <Col N="524"/>of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department&rsquo;s teacher education section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of postgraduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the special education support service or SESS to support schools staff locally.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 824, 828 and 845 together.</P>
        <P>Government commitment to the PLC sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers&rsquo; pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is very significant. We have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996-97. Indeed, the number of PLC places approved for 2005-06 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004-05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188. We also extended the provision of maintenance grants to PLC students with effect from September 1998. The PLC maintenance grant scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education. There were nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they received some &euro;23 million in direct support. Tuition fees for PLC courses are also waived. PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs. A supplementary non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. This amounted to &euro;5.5 million in 2005. In addition, capital funding for works at 11 post-leaving certificate colleges in 2006 has been agreed.</P>
        <P>Other developments funded by my Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the institutes of technology.</P>
        <P>The McIver report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations. It has been estimated, in consultation with management and staff interests, that the recommendations for staffing would involve at a minimum the creation of at least 800 new posts at a cost of over &euro;48 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This level of additional provision cannot be considered in isolation from other areas of education. In their consideration of the needs of the PLC sector into the future my officials have been examining,<i> inter alia,</i> the non-teaching educational tasks particular to PLC teachers, the <Col N="526"/>demands on the management side and the challenges presented by the variation in size of the 200 plus PLC providers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The McIver report also featured in recent discussions my officials had with representatives of the Irish Vocational Education Association. I want to invest in educational opportunity for learners in further education by providing the necessary system supports that will allow the sector as a whole to fulfil its important potential. There is a need for a realistic engagement between the main partners in agreeing priorities for progress, identifying workable timescales and beginning to make tangible progress on aspects of the wider agenda involved. Based on the issues identified in the McIver report, I intend to table proposals for discussions on the way forward. The timing and extent of implementation along with the funding to be made available will be decided when agreement is reached following these discussions.</P>

	<P>The issue of quality of teaching within a school falls within the remit of the board of <Col N="528"/>management and principal of that school. It is the duty of the board to provide, or cause to be provided, an appropriate education for all students attending the school. The Education Act requires that &ldquo;schools use their available resources to establish and maintain systems whereby the efficiency and effectiveness of its operation can be assessed, including the quality and effectiveness of teaching in the school&rdquo;. The guidance and direction of teachers, the assignment of their teaching duties and the monitoring of the quality of learning and teaching on a day-to-day basis is the responsibility of the principal teacher of the school, who is accountable to the board. The inspectorate, through whole-school evaluation, monitors the performance of principals and boards of management in this regard.</P>
        <P>The inspectorate of my Department is responsible for evaluating schools, including the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of individual teachers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The framework for whole school evaluations in primary and post-primary schools includes the evaluation of teaching. In post-primary schools, and inspectors also conduct an evaluation of teaching during the course of subject inspections. At primary level, inspectors evaluate the work of teachers on probation.</P>
        <P>In 2005, 253 whole school reports &mdash; both whole school evaluations and tuairisc&iacute; scoile &mdash; were conducted in primary schools, and 53 whole school evaluations were completed in post-primary schools. The inspectorate evaluated and reported on 1,611 probationary teachers at primary level in 2005, and at post-primary level 676 subject inspections were conducted. In addition to WSE, subject inspection, and evaluation of teachers on probation at primary level, inspectors periodically conduct thematic evaluations of specific aspects of educational provision, paying particular attention to the quality of teaching observed.</P>
        <P>Where, in the course of evaluations, underperformance of teachers is noted, the inspectorate draws the attention of the principal to this fact. At primary level, rule 161 of the rules for national schools outlines the evaluation procedures to be followed where the work of a teacher has deteriorated to such an extent that the estimate &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; is no longer merited. In the case of teachers employed by vocational education committees, Department of Education and Science Circular 43/85 outlines the evaluation procedures to be followed in the context of adverse reports on teaching performance.</P>

        <P>Provision is made for the inclusion of religious education on the curriculum for primary schools.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 833 and 834 together.</P>
        <P>I can confirm for the Deputy that my Department funds educational services for persons with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, from the time that they are enrolled in school. The special educational needs of such children can be addressed in special schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual pupil. Many pupils with ADHD are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and/or special needs assistant services. Where the level of the disorder is of a more serious nature, provision may be made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools.</P><Col N="530"/>
        <P>Currently, my Department has sanctioned two special classes for pupils with ADHD in a mainstream school setting. In addition to this, my Department has sanctioned the following provision for pupils with emotional and behavioural difficulties at primary school level: ten special classes for pupils with emotional behavioural difficulties and seven special classes for pupils with severe emotional behavioural difficulties. All such classes operate at a pupil-teacher ratio or PTR of 8:1 with the support of a minimum of one special needs assistant. Classes for children with more severe disorders operate at a PTR of 6:1.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, there are 14 special schools for pupils with emotional disturbance. My Department has no record of an application to establish a special school solely for children with ADHD. It is my intention to continue to build on these developments as necessary to ensure that all children, including children with ADHD, receive the support they require.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. The NCSE, through its local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs, including those with ADHD, from 1 January 2005. Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a primary or post primary school, the school may apply to the local SENO for the appropriate supports for the pupil if such supports are not available in the school.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the establishment of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with ADHD, receive the educational support they require.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 835 and 836 together.</P>
        <P>There are components in the pre-service training courses for primary teachers which <Col N="531"/>enable student teachers to recognise and deal with children with special educational needs, including pupils with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD. At second level, there are elements to both the higher diploma in education and the education degree programmes in the University of Limerick, as part of a general alertness orientation programme, on the variety of learning difficulties which pupils may have; this would also cover the issue of ADHD.</P>
        <P>Discussions with the various colleges of education and universities are ongoing in order to ensure that appropriate responses are made at pre-service level in relation to the continuing needs of all trainee teachers to acquire knowledge of, and familiarity with, the needs of pupils with special educational needs including issues such as ADHD. Building on the training provided in the colleges of education and universities, my Department has developed a strategy to meet the continuing professional development of teachers working in schools with pupils with special educational needs. The strategy has resulted in a major expansion in the range of post graduate professional development programmes, the introduction of a range of new programmes to provide a mix of intensive induction training and more advanced training in specific areas. Teachers are made aware of the implications of ADHD for children&rsquo;s learning and teaching as part of these courses.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the special education support service, SESS, is another element of this strategy. As part of its work, the support service provides fee subsidies to enable teachers to avail of on-line training on &ldquo;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: (ADHD) Effective Management and Teaching Strategies&rdquo;. This course is provided three times each academic year &mdash; in the autumn, spring and summer periods. Each course runs over a two-month period enabling the teachers to self-pace their learning. The course combines the latest scientific knowledge and theory of ADHD with case-studies along with practical, effective classroom techniques and innovative teaching strategies. Teachers learn to recognise the signs of ADHD as well as being exposed to current theories and research about ADHD. They also gain practical skills in terms of designing, implementing and evaluating alternative management and teaching strategies. In the 2004-05 academic year, 260 teachers undertook the courses, and the SESS allocated &euro;45,000 to subvent the cost of the training. In addition, 550 teachers participated on a course entitled &ldquo;Positive Student Behaviour&rdquo;. Again, the SESS provided fee subventions amounting to &euro;90,000 for this course, which was provided on an online basis. This course introduces participants to a wide range of models, methods and strategies for managing student <Col N="532"/>behaviour, with particular emphasis on the effective management of students who exhibit behavioural and adjustment problems. The course complements professional development in relation to ADHD given the high incidences of behaviour difficulties associated with ADHD. The SESS has also designed whole staff seminars for special schools entitled &ldquo;Introduction to Challenging Behaviour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Managing Challenging Behaviour&rdquo; of 30 seminars each, catering to the needs of 770 personnel working in the special schools setting. This work further complements the various training supports for teachers. The SESS also operates a local Initiatives scheme and has provided whole-staff training, individual teacher support and conference participation in relation to ADHD.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the steps taken in recent years, which I have covered in some detail, represent significant progress in the development of in-career supports for teachers of children with ADHD.</P>

	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment. As the <Col N="533"/>Deputy is aware, enormous progress has been made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At second level, approximately 1,654 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,102 whole time equivalent special needs assistants or SNAs in our second level schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities or special needs. The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities or special needs. The responsibilities of the NCSE include deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; on applications for special needs assistant or SNA hours; and processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</P>
        <P>The Department supports the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools throughout the country. The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible. In recent years, the Department has supported the establishment of a number of special classes for pupils with autism in mainstream post primary schools. The organisation of such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education.</P><Col N="534"/>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser or SENO will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. In the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made. In addition, my Department&rsquo;s teacher education section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the special education support service or SESS to support schools staff locally.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>The guidelines in relation to an exemption from the study of Irish at post-primary level are set out in circular M10/94. Under the terms of this circular students, in the following circumstances, may be allowed to substitute any other subject from the list of approved subjects for Irish: students whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland, and students who were previously enrolled as recognised students in a primary or second level school who are being re-enrolled after a period spent abroad, provided that at least three years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the student is at least 11 years of age on re-enrolment.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to modify these provisions at this time.</P>

	<P>The student assistance fund is available to students experiencing particular or unexpected hardship during their course of study. The fund is allocated on a <i>per capita</i> basis to publicly-funded higher education institutions. In 2005-06, 35 institutions received funding totalling &euro;5.8 million. More than 12,000 students benefited from the fund during 2004-05.</P>
        <P>Until 2005, the amount of funding available for the access funds, including the student assistance fund, varied annually, depending on the level of demand for the top-up maintenance grant. The decision in 2004 to separate expenditure on the top-up maintenance grant from other access funding programmes has ended these variations. Students apply for the student assistance fund through their student services office or to the access officer within their institution.</P>
        <P>The millennium partnership fund established in 2000 also provides community-based funding. It supports retention and participation among under-represented groups of students in further or higher education and is available to students in area partnerships and community groups which participate in the local development social inclusion programme or LDSIP.</P>
        <P>Application for millennium funding is made annually by organisations through Pobal Ltd., the State company established to promote social inclusion, reconciliation and equality in Ireland and which has administered the fund since it was established. In 2005, a total of &euro;1.89 million was allocated to 57 community groups and partnerships. In 2004-05, the latest year for which figures are available, approximately 3,750 students in higher and further education benefited from the fund.</P>
        <P>The national office for equity of access to higher education within the Higher Education Authority recently completed a review of funding to achieve equity of access to higher education. The review process involved qualitative and quantitative data research, wide-ranging consultation, the publication of a discussion document, submissions and focus group meetings. <Col N="536"/>This review was published by the national access office and launched by me in December 2005. Included in this review were the student assistance fund and the millennium partnership fund. Local variations in funding at institutional and/or community level is one of the six key issues for resolution that the review identifies. The review sets out the context in which current variations in the approach to the administration of the student assistance fund and the millennium partnership fund have arisen.</P>
        <P>The review recommends that guidelines on local funding should be agreed and implemented so that decisions on which students receive funding are clear and transparent. The review goes on to recommend that community and college administrators, facilitated by the national access office, should together review and agree guidelines for the student assistance and millennium funds to ensure that there is a consistent and fair approach nationally, so that students in some communities and colleges are not disadvantaged in comparison with others. In addition to agreeing guidelines for each fund, ways of ensuring the most effective interaction and use of each should also be addressed.</P>
        <P>The national access office has commenced work on implementing the recommendations of the funding review, including the above recommendation. I envisage that the office will, in this context, develop and implement overarching guidelines pertaining to the operation of the student assistance fund and the millennium partnership fund.</P>

	<P>I have no plans at present to extend the free tuition fees schemes to include part-time students. Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides tax relief for eligible persons, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU member states and postgraduate courses in non-EU countries.</P>
        <P>Tax relief for courses of at least two years&rsquo; duration at undergraduate level extends to approved full or part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges in the State and any other EU member state and approved full or part-time courses operated by <Col N="537"/>colleges in any EU member state providing distance education in the State.</P>
        <P>In 2001, section 29 of the 2001 Finance Act amended the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for the amalgamation of the then existing four tax reliefs for third level education fees. The section also extended the relief by removing the restrictions for repeat years, on individuals undertaking more than one course, on individuals already holding a third level qualification and the exclusion of certain courses in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training. The relief is also extended to postgraduate fees paid for third level education in private and publicly funded third level colleges in non-EU countries. Tax relief for undergraduate fees is also now available in EU countries for duly accredited private third level colleges. Tax relief on tuition fees is claimed directly from the tax office using an I.T. 31 form. Details of approved colleges and courses are also <Col N="538"/>available on Revenue&rsquo;s internet site at <i>www.revenue.ie.</i></P>

	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the national council for special education, NCSE, has taken over key functions from my Department in the area of special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the <Col N="540"/>resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities or special needs.</P>
        <P>The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities or special needs.</P>
        <P>The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following &mdash; deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours; processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</P>
        <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Special needs assistant posts are allocated where the professionally assessed needs of a child or children involved is such as to require the delivery of such support. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant <Col N="541"/>application for resources and inform the school of the outcome.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the NCSE that an application for special needs assistant support in respect of the pupil in question has been examined by the SENO, who decided that the needs of the pupil were not such as to require SNA support.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the student support grant schemes assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment. The process of assessing eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Officials of my Department contacted the higher education grants section of both Offaly County Council and VEC concerning the candidate referred to by the Deputy. It is understood there is no record of an application being received from this candidate.</P>

It was included in my announcement of the 6 March 2006 in this regard. I confirm that, in the meantime, the school has requested temporary accommodation until its permanent structure is in place.

        <P>While my Department has concerns about the suitability of the method proposed, the person concerned has been advised that the Department&rsquo;s guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school and to incorporate, should it so wish, any methodology including the one developed by the person referred to by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The major focus for my Department under the ICT in schools programme at present is the roll-out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools. This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three-year &euro;18 million joint Government-IBEC-TIF, Telecommunications and Internet Federation, Fund to fund local connectivity at school level. The broadband connectivity is being provided via a schools national broadband network supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, e-mail, security controls and content filtering. A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network. The overall costs of the schools broadband access programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of &euro;30 million.</P><Col N="547"/>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>The schools broadband access programme builds on the investment by my Department in grant-aiding schools to develop their internal networks. Since December 2004, more than 3,700 schools have received grants to develop their networking facilities at a cost of &euro;20 million. The development of internal networking facilities in schools is critical to supporting schools&rsquo; full exploitation of the potential offered by broadband connectivity and the efficient use of computer software.</P>
        <P>High quality digital content is essential to ensuring effective use of ICT in the classroom. In this context, the Scoilnet portal has been developed to provide a focal point of reference and a resource for teachers, students and parents. This portal site provides significant amounts of curriculum-relevant content linking to over 6,000 websites, the content of which is aligned directly to curricular and subject areas. The NCTE is working with the European Schoolnet, EUN, to implement a technological infrastructure to allow Irish schools to share access to a wide range of on-line educational databases located around Europe. An important aspect of this process is the development of an application profile for Irish curricular content to facilitate meta-tagging of content to international standards. The NCTE is collaborating with the NCCA in this regard. The NCTE is also currently considering the acquisition of a range of on-line reference libraries.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently examining the future priorities for the ICT in schools programme. This work is being complemented by a census of ICT infrastructure which was undertaken by the NCTE and is currently being finalised and by an evaluation of the impact of ICT on teaching and learning which my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate is currently conducting.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is not yet available for the current school year.</P>
        <P>Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State.</P><Col N="548"/>
        <P>Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the action plan for educational inclusion I launched in May 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in the 180 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years. Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next two years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools. At present the general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that, with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on. However, the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year, this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Circular 0023/2006 outlining the revised staffing schedule for the 2006-07 school year is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Hard copies of the circular have been issued to all primary schools.</P>
        <P>In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done this, and now, in line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the higher <Col N="549"/>education grants scheme, a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether a grant was paid previously. The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification. Notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the previous postgraduate qualification(s) was attained, may be deemed eligible for grant aid, subject to a limit of a maximum of four years at postgraduate level.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 80 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule, circular 0023/2006, which has issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie,</i> the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006-07 school year will be a principal and two mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>The board of management of the school concerned has submitted an appeal to the staffing appeal board. The appeal will be considered by the appeal board at a meeting which is scheduled to take place in May. The board of management will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible thereafter. The appeal board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs including children with visual impairment. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
        <P>Enormous progress has been made over the past number of years in increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</P><Col N="551"/>
        <P>At second level, approximately 1,654 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers who were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,102 whole time equivalent special needs assistants, SNAs, in our second level schools.</P>
        <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the national council for special education, NCSE, has taken over key functions from my Department in the area of special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities or special needs.</P>
        <P>The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities or special needs.</P>
        <P>The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following &mdash; deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours; processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs; under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and special needs assistant support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s teacher education section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major <Col N="552"/>expansion of the range of postgraduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the special education support service, SESS, to support schools staff locally.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides a visiting teacher service to support the needs of blind and visually impaired students in primary and post-primary schools. Visiting teachers provide assistance in the educational planning and monitoring of educational progress of pupils. They provide a link between home and school and play a part in the successful transition from primary through to secondary level schooling.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to ensure the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational welfare board, NEWB, as the single statutory agency with responsibility for school attendance operating under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question concerns two young people and their non-attendance at school. The responsibility for individual cases of non-attendance falls within the remit of the NEWB. In response to questions raised previously by the Deputy, concerning the same issue, I requested the NEWB to respond directly to the Deputy. I have been informed by the NEWB that correspondence relating to this matter issued to the Deputy on 30 March and a further letter updating the Deputy on the proposed action and ongoing developments in this case was issued as recently as 21 April. This Government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to complete their education.</P>
        <P>Measures designed to improve school completion include the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board in 2002 with a remit to monitor school attendance, help <Col N="553"/>parents to get a school place for their child and run promotional campaigns on the importance of regular attendance and finishing school. In areas of disadvantage a key component of the work of the home-school-community liaison co-ordinator is promoting school attendance to parents while the school completion programme fosters the development of strong links between primary and post-primary schools to assist pupils with the transfer to and retention at second level. Work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for integrated working between all these services.</P>
        <P>This Department also supports youth encounter projects, YEPs, that provide educational facilities to young people who have become alienated from the conventional school system and is promoting increased integration between the work of second-level schools and training opportunities, such as Youthreach centres, catering for young early school leavers.</P>
        <P>The Department and the National Educational Welfare Board will continue to work together to ensure an integrated approach to children at risk is adopted.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 885 to 889, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out the outturn for each of the four student support schemes: higher education grants scheme; VEC scholarship scheme; third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and maintenance grant scheme for students attending PLC courses.</P>
        <P>It also includes details of expenditure in respect of the special rates of maintenance grant, top-up grant, payable to disadvantaged students under each of the above schemes.</P>
        <P>Up to the end of 2004 allocations for each of the student support schemes, named above, was provided under individual subheads. Funding for all of the schemes was amalgamated into a single subhead with effect from 2005. The outturn for each of the schemes under the single subhead, for 2006, will not be available until the end of the financial year. The provision for 2006 is &euro;228.345 million.</P>
        <P>Statistical returns in respect of the 2005-06 academic year will not be submitted to my <Col N="555"/>Department until the academic year is completed and all payments finalised. Data in respect of grant recipients in 2005-06 will not, therefore, be available until at least later this year.</P>
        <P>On the basis of previous experience it is estimated that the distribution of grantholders by rate of grant was as follows for the academic year 2004-2005: percentage of students in receipt of 100% of third level grant was 92%; percentage of students in receipt of 75% of third level grant was 3%; percentage of students in receipt of 50% of third level grant was 3%; percentage of students in receipt of 25% of third level grant was 2%.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out the outturn for each of the four student support schemes for 2004 and 2005 and the total allocation for 2006&mdash; Higher Education Grants Scheme (HEG); VEC Scholarship Scheme (VEC); Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees (TLT); Maintenance Grant Scheme for students attending PLC courses (PLC). It also includes details of expenditure in respect of the Special Rates of Maintenance Grant (Top-Up Grant), payable to disadvantaged students under each of the above schemes.</P>

	<P>Recognition of a qualification for the purpose of teaching a particular subject from the post-primary curriculum is awarded where an assessment of the documentation submitted in relation to that qualification shows that the criteria for such recognition have been met. These criteria require among other things that the qualification has adequately prepared the holder to teach the subject to the highest level of the <Col N="556"/>curriculum. In the case of mathematics the highest level is leaving certificate higher.</P>
        <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 177 of 26 January 2006, I pointed out that the registration council, to whom the person named by the Deputy had applied for recognition, had refused recognition of her qualifications for the purpose of teaching mathematics as the qualification did not meet the criteria for such recognition. The applicant has not submitted any further documentary evidence in support of her application. The registration council has since been replaced by the teaching council, which is now the statutory body for the recognition of qualifications for all teachers.</P>

	<P>The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year, 2005-2006, is one principal, ten mainstream class teachers, two permanent and two temporary learning support-resource teachers, LS-RTs, two permanent resource teachers for Travellers, RTT, two supply project teachers, one temporary language support teacher and three teachers under giving children an even break.</P>
        <P>The general allocation of LS-RTs to schools is intended to cater for children with learning support and high incidence special educational needs. LS-RT allocations are based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P><Col N="557"/>
        <P>The allocation for the school referred to by the Deputy is 2.9 posts. Disadvantaged schools eligible for additional staffing under the giving children an even break scheme, such as the school in question, have a preferential pupil-teacher allocation ratio of 80:1 under the general allocation.</P>
        <P>The new system has a number of benefits associated with it, among which are that it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place when the child enrols and it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels. It is also the case that it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments and allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources. It is intended that a review of the general allocation model will be undertaken within three years of operation.</P>
        <P>Schools may also be allocated individual resource teaching allocations in respect of pupils with low incidence special educational needs, as appropriate. Applications for such support should be submitted by the school in question to the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, for consideration. Any concerns the school authorities have in regard to their resource teaching allocation for such pupils may be referred to the SENO. Similarly applications for special needs assistant, SNA, support in respect of pupils with special educational needs should be referred by the school to the local SENO.</P>
        <P>I advise the Deputy that officials from my Department will contact the school shortly regarding the matter of additional resource teaching support for Traveller pupils and their staffing allocation under giving children an even break for the 2006-07 school year.</P>
        <P>The provision of therapy services is a matter for the Health Service Executive and funding is provided to the HSE for such purposes.</P>

	<P>My Department is engaged in the roll-out of broadband Internet connectivity to recognised primary and post-primary schools. This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry pursuant to an agreement with IBEC-TIF-Telecommunications and Internet Federation. This agreement provides for the establishment of a three-year &euro;18 million joint Government and IBEC-TIF fund, with industry contributing &euro;5 million per annum and the Government contributing &euro;1 million per annum. The agreement is to provide local broadband connectivity to schools. This connectivity is being provided via a schools national broadband network supported by HEAnet to provide managed Internet access, e-mail, security controls and content filtering. A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity. The overall costs of the schools broadband access programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of &euro;30 million.</P>
        <P>The scope of this project, as provided for in the agreement with industry, is to provide broadband connectivity to recognised primary and post-primary schools. The question of providing broadband connectivity to Youthreach centres and other centres of education will be considered separately.</P>

	<P>I am conscious that the Dublin 15 area as a whole is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country and, as a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for primary school places. My Department is taking a number of measures to increase the capacity of existing schools in the area concerned along with the development of new schools to meet this growing demand. All building projects arising from these interventions are awarded a band one priority rating under my Departments prioritisation criteria for large-scale building <Col N="563"/>projects to ensure that they are delivered as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>In the Littlepace-Castaheaney area a new school building has recently been completed at Mary Mother of Hope national school, with an additional project under way with a target delivery date of September 2007. In addition a new primary school campus is planned for a school site in Ongar which will have a minimum of 32 classrooms. Part of this project will provide a permanent accommodation solution for Castaheaney Educate Together national school which has agreed to increase its junior infant intake by one extra class grouping this year. This project also has a target completion date of September 2007.</P>
        <P>This area is also served by the Sacred Heart national school Huntstown where an extension project to provide a 32-classroom school is nearing completion. In the Diswellstown area, St. Patrick&rsquo;s national school has recently moved into a new 24 classroom school. This will facilitate an annual three stream intake. However, as an exceptional matter the board of management has agreed to take a fourth stream of junior infants this year. In addition to this, the board of management of St. Mochta&rsquo;s national school, which has an intake of three junior infant classes, has agreed to enrol a fourth junior infant class for September 2006. An extension project to cater for this development will also attract a band one priority rating. Other developments in the Dublin 15 area include the planned expansion of St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school in Castleknock and extensions to St. Brigid&rsquo;s boys and girls national schools, Blanchardstown.</P>
        <P>In addition, a new Educate Together school opened in Tyrellstown in September 2005. My Department has approved the provision of six additional classrooms for September 2006 to cater for new enrolments and special education teachers. It is anticipated that his school will enrol three junior infant classes. I am confident that the measures outlined will assist in alleviating the immediate demand for pupil places in the area. However, due to the current level of demand emanating from the Dublin 15 area, the need to provide even further school accommodation is under consideration and my Department is engaging with the key school patron authorities that are active in the area in this regard.</P>

	<P>Ensuring the protection, health and <Col N="564"/>welfare of children is a key concern for the Government, parents, agencies working with children and society generally and I assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to do all we can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe. In the education sector vetting is available in respect of prospective employees of children in detention schools as well as special needs assistants &mdash; SNAs &mdash; and bus escorts to children with special needs. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the Garda central vetting unit, which has been relocated to Thurles under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, to ensure it can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children, whether on a full-time or part-time basis.</P>
        <P>As a first step in the expansion of services provided by the vetting unit it is proposed that new staff employed in the 2006-07 school year will be vetted. In the case of new teachers, vetting will form part of the process of the registration by the newly established Teaching Council. The council will be responsible for submitting the applications to the vetting unit. In the case of non-teaching staff, it will be the responsibility of the relevant school authorities to submit the applications. My Department is engaged in discussions with the relevant interests &mdash; school management authorities, unions, the Teaching Council and the vetting unit &mdash; on the procedures and processes which will apply regarding the vetting of persons in the education sector. Guidelines for school authorities are being prepared and will be issued shortly.</P>

A number of these have been carried out over the years where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a sole provider school closes <Col N="565"/>due to declining enrolment. Catchment boundaries have provided and continue to provide a very useful tool in facilitating the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs and the operation of the national school transport service.</P>

	<P>Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino has been contracted by my Department to provide the SCG examination in 2006, 2007 and 2008 on the basis of holding a main examination each year followed by a repeat examination. The main examination for 2006 was held on the 18, 19 and 20 April 2006 in a number of centres throughout the country. There were 785 applicants for the examination. Col&aacute;iste Mhuire will provide a repeat examination in autumn 2006 for any candidates who sat the April 2006 examination and failed to pass any module or modules of that examination.</P>
        <P>Prior to 1999 candidates for the SCG examination were required to pass all four components of the SCG in the one year. Since 1999 however candidates have been allowed to take the SCG on a modular basis. This facilitates candidates who wish to do so to attempt a module or a number of modules at different sittings in different years. Candidates who pass in any one module of the examination are exempt from that module for a period not exceeding five years and are thus afforded a five-year period in which to pass all four modules of the examination. I am satisfied with the adequacy of existing arrangements for the provision of one main examination each year followed by a repeat examination.</P>

	<P>Enormous progress has been made in recent years on increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with approximately 2,500 in 2001, an increase of approximately 2,500 posts. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. In addition, there are more than 1,000 teachers in special schools and in the region of 600 teachers in special classes attached to mainstream primary schools.</P>
        <P>At second level, approximately 2,186 whole-time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs and those with learning support needs. This compares with approximately 1,115 whole-time equivalent teachers who were in place in the 2001-02 school year for such pupils.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has also been made on increasing the number of SNAs in our schools who specifically cater for the care needs of children with special educational needs. There are more than 7,300 whole-time equivalent SNAs in primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs compared with approximately 2,500 at primary level and 292 whole-time equivalent SNAs at second level in 2001.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education &mdash; NCSE &mdash; has taken over key functions from my Department regarding special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities-special needs. The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities-special needs. Its responsibilities include deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level and deciding on applications for special needs assistant &mdash; SNA &mdash; hours.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements the council, through the local special educational needs <Col N="568"/>organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department&rsquo;s teacher education section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of postgraduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the special education support service &mdash; SESS &mdash; to support schools staff locally.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 912 to 916, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Youthreach provides two years&rsquo; integrated education, training and work experience to young people aged 15 to 20 years who are at least six months in the labour market and have left school early without any qualifications or vocational training. The programme provides a strong emphasis on personal development, the core skills of literacy-numeracy, communications and information technology. Staffing levels in Youthreach centres have remained constant in the past five years. Annual reports on students attending Youthreach centres point up significant proportions of learners who have literacy and numeracy deficits. The task force on student behaviour recognised that Youthreach centres are catering for many students who presented with emotional and-or behavioural difficulties while in school.</P>
        <P>It is my Department&rsquo;s policy to seek to encourage and facilitate the participation of people with disabilities on programmes offered in the further education sector. Generally, issues of access for individuals to further education programmes are addressed at local level. Where a student with special needs is admitted to a Youthreach centre, educational supports, equipment and training, as appropriate, are provided in the centre in accordance with the learning aims and objectives of the programme. My Department has provided &euro;500,000 for a national programme for staff training. This training will allow staff, as a team, to identify and respond to the special needs of their learners on an individual basis. The focus of this training is on individual assessment, programme planning, student mentoring and inter-agency work. This inter-agency work involves collaboration between centres, other statutory agencies and community-based services, for example, the Health Service Executive, probation service, addiction services, etc.</P>
        <P>In 2005 special grants of &euro;1.5 million were provided by my Department to vocational education committees to upgrade services through the purchase of equipment and materials, or refurbishment or minor structural works or materials to enhance the provision for students with disabilities. With effect from 1 January 2005 the National Council for Special Education &mdash; NCSE &mdash; took over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 October 2005 and acts under the broad policy direction of my Department. The council does not at present provide a service to students with special needs in Youthreach centres but it is expected that such a service will be available when all the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special <Col N="570"/>Educational Needs Act 2004 are fully implemented. The needs of these students attending Youthreach centres are under active consideration.</P>

	<P>Capital funding is being provided under the school building and modernisation programme 2006-2010 for the refurbishment of science laboratories undertaken as part of an overall refurbishment programme of second level schools, for the upgrading of science facilities exclusively or by provision of new facilities in the case of newly built or extended schools. Additionally I have provided for class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the sciences.</P>
        <P>My Department spent in excess of &euro;13 million in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised junior science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of &euro;3,500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey also received funding. Funding is again available this year to schools which have yet to apply for the basic grant of &euro;3,500 per science laboratory and for other specified equipment to enable them to provide the new curriculum.</P>
        <P>Schools have also received funding under the summer works scheme in 2004 and 2005 to refurbish science laboratories. In the application for funding under the 2006 summer works scheme, post-primary schools were requested to identify specifically and provide details of any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being applied for so that consideration could be given to approving these projects for 2006. Following the processing of the 34 applicants in this category, 26 schools were approved to commence the upgrading or refurbishment of their science facilities under the 2006 summer works scheme at an estimated total cost of &euro;5.7 million. The eight unsuccessful applicants comprised two large-scale projects already in architectural planning, two of which were converted to major projects as in addition to upgrading science laboratories major refurbishments were required throughout the <Col N="571"/>school and four received funding for higher priority projects as identified by the schools themselves.</P>
        <P>The provision of science facilities and equipment is in part the responsibility of individual schools and funding can only be considered where my Department receives applications in the first instance. It is not possible to outline the level of science facilities or equipment in all schools across a province, region or county but I will assist the Deputy with available information in respect of a particular school he may choose to nominate.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy is a new school which opened in September 2005. It accommodates two junior infant classes. When fully occupied, the school will operate as a two-stream six-classroom school. To enable it develop in this manner, it can only enrol two junior infant classes annually. This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over-enrolment in the early stages and, crucially, to ensure that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this position and as an exceptional matter, the school has been given approval to enrol three junior infant classes for the next school year on the grounds that this will not impact negatively on the other schools in question. Typically, a new school commences in temporary accommodation. Accommodation is provided incrementally, thereafter, to meet the schools junior infant intake level each year in the context of junior infant accommodation available in other schools in the area. A new school would have achieved a certain sustainable growth level without affecting other schools before transferring to its permanent accommodation. Its developmental curve would continue on this basis until all its accommodation is in use.</P>
        <P>If a building is available for the school in question at inception, it does not mean that an orderly growth can be abandoned given the effect that excessive enrolments will have on other schools in the area which have also been funded by the taxpayer. While enrolment policies are a matter for school authorities, the Department expects the enrolment polices of individual schools to complement the demand for pupil places in an area and, as in this case, to assist the growth of the new school in an orderly fashion. This is in the best interests of the schools, pupils and wider community alike.</P>
        <P>Fundamentally, the existing schools, which have served the community well, particularly by obliging with extra pupil places when there was severe pressure for such places in recent years, now have a certain level of accommodation and teaching allocations in place. This cannot be ignored because a new school and a new building have come on stream which will, in their own right, cater for the continuing growing needs of the area as time goes by as was always my Department&rsquo;s intention. The question is how to support the new school until it is in a position to operate within the confines of its own current <Col N="573"/>funding resources which will grow year on year. This is under discussion with the board of management.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 925 and 926 together.</P>
        <P>As previously outlined to the Deputy, the school to which he refers made an application for additional temporary accommodation for the 2006-07 school year. This has been approved by my Department. The extra accommodation will meet the needs of the school&rsquo;s enrolment policy which operates a cut-off point. This cut-off point will result in the carryover of a small number of pupils to the next school year which is not uncommon where an increasing demand for enrolments manifests itself. In the case in question, the cut-off point does not contravene the requirements of the Education (Welfare) Act.</P>
        <P>With regard to the long-term accommodation needs of the school, my Department is examining the demographics of the area to determine the optimum school size required. It has commenced consultations with the school authority in this regard. This matter will be finalised as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the OPW continues in its efforts to acquire a site for the new school.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 927 to 929, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My Department has an internal legal services section, the functions of which are to ensure policymaking is informed and takes account of relevant legal and constitutional requirements; to advise the Minister and the Department on legal issues; to ensure the effective management of litigation in which the Department is named; and to ensure the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme as it relates to education is implemented. The section works closely with the other law offices of the State to ensure consistency and quality of the legal services provided.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s legal services team includes two qualified lawyers &mdash; Dalton Tattan, an assistant principal officer and a barrister-at-law, and Emily Ennis who is a barrister-at-law and is employed in her professional capacity. The section provides much of the day-to-day legal services required by my Department. However, some legal work is outsourced. The details of payments for the years 2004 and 2005 are listed. The bulk of these relate to legal advice and assistance provided to the Department in responding to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, including responding to directions by the commission to discover documents. These payments are as follows: </P>

	<P>My Department holds two small plots of land on a laneway which was part of the former military barracks in the locality in question. In recent years there has been unauthorised encroachment upon those plots by another party. My Department&rsquo;s properties officer recently inspected the property and met the party <Col N="577"/>concerned. Arising from that meeting, it is intended to resurvey the property in the very near future and arrange for the removal of the encroachment.</P>

	<P>The military authorities maintained a significant degree of liaison with the person referred to and other family members in the aftermath of the tragic disappearance of the member of the Naval Service referred to. The person and the family were kept informed of events. The services of the military personnel support service were offered to the family who have been assured they will be informed of any future developments.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the military authorities that in August 2003, the family were offered an opportunity to examine the report of the military court of inquiry into the disappearance of the member of the Naval Service. The position in this case is that it is the spouse of the member of the Naval Service referred to who is the person officially designated as next of kin. As there are separate legal proceedings in this matter, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the airspace change proposal submitted to the Irish Aviation Authority by Weston Airport Limited in 2005, which includes the use of instrument navigation aids to assist the arrival and departure of aircraft in accordance with instrument flight rules. Use of these landing aids would result in flight paths which would penetrate military airspace.</P>
        <P>The Irish Aviation Authority convened a group called the Weston action group to examine the implications of the airspace change proposal. As the Air Corps&rsquo;s main operational aerodrome and military flying airspace is adjacent to Weston and will be affected by the airspace change proposal, the IAA invited my Department and the Air Corps to participate in the meetings of the Weston action group to ensure the levels of safety afforded to, and operational capability of, military aircraft and the aerodrome are not compromised. This remains the sole purpose of my Department&rsquo;s involvement on the Weston action group.</P>
        <P>My principal concern regarding Weston Aerodrome is the maintenance of safe and functional airspace in which military flight training and air operations can continue on a 24-hour basis from Baldonnel. The decision as to whether Weston&rsquo;s request for an airspace change is granted is solely within the remit of the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>

Of this figure 1,125 were for general service enlistment, 296 for the apprenticeships competitions, 1,004 for the cadetship competition and a further 47 were for direct entry specialist competitions. In 2005 a total number of 479 successful applicants took up positions in the Permanent Defence Force, of whom 384 were general service enlistments, 55 cadets, 28 apprentices and 12 direct entry specialists.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 937 to 939, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Medical Corps is a combat support service corps of the Defence Forces. The core objective of the Medical Corps is to maximise the medical readiness of the Defence Forces for operational activities and to provide field medical support to brigade structured Defence Forces. The mission of the Medical Corps is to ensure and co-ordinate the provision of medical, dental and pharmaceutical support to the Defence Forces in the execution of their roles as assigned by Government.</P>
        <P>Military medical services and their facilities exist to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and support them in operational and overseas activities. The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training. The services of civilian general practitioners are regularly engaged to provide primary care when medical officers are not available. Serving members of the Defence Forces are provided with free medical treatment within military medical facilities by medical officers of the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces are normally dependent on civilian health care facilities for the provision of higher level hospital inpatient services for members of the Defence Forces. The costs of such external medical services are met by the Defence Forces and the Department.</P>
        <P>The families of serving members of the Defence Forces have no entitlement to the provision of any medical services by the Medical Corps, either directly or indirectly. The Medical Corps does not have the capability, nor is it its role, to provide civilian medical services for families of members of the Defence Forces. The sole exception to this policy is the clinic for families of personnel serving in the Curragh Camp where, for essentially historical reasons, the Medical Corps has provided a general practitioner service to the families of enlisted personnel who are serving with military units based on the Curragh. The question of individual eligibility for a medical card under the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s general medical service scheme &mdash; GMS &mdash; is a matter for determination by the local administration of the Health Service Executive in light of the relevant guidelines.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 940 to 943, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Deputy Judge Advocate General has been disestablished since October 2004 and replaced by two independent offices, namely, the Office of the Director of the Defence Forces Legal Service and Director of Military Prosecutions, and the Office of the Judge Advocate. The Office of the Director of the Legal Service and Director of Military Prosecutions is held by Colonel William Nott BL. He has a legal staff of two commissioned officers, Commandant Richard Brennan BL and Commandant Paul Rochford BL. The Office of the Judge Advocate is currently held by Lieutenant Colonel P. A. McCourt BL. All commissioned officers within the Defence Forces legal service are qualified barristers.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Director of the Legal Service is the preliminary source of legal advice for the Chief of Staff and Minister on all matters of military law and international law affecting the operations of the Defence Forces. The Office of the Director of the Legal Service and Director of Military Prosecutions also works closely with the Office of the Attorney General and Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
        <P>Recruitment for the Office of the Director of the Legal Service is by way of competitive interview following applications from suitably qualified commissioned officers from throughout the Permanent Defence Force. The required qualifications are to have been called to the Bar of Ireland, having achieved the required qualifications or to have been admitted to the <Col N="582"/>Roll of Solicitors of Ireland, having achieved the required qualifications.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces employ two other qualified officers in a professional capacity for the purposes of legal work and advice at Defence Forces Headquarters. The claims administration section of the directorate of administration is staffed by two captains. Captain Noel Conway is a qualified solicitor and Captain Fintan McCarthy is a BCL graduate. These officers deal with the military aspects of personal injury and other such claims taken against the Minister and work with the corresponding civil branch within the Department of Defence secretariat. However, these two officers are not members of the Defence Forces legal service.</P>
        <P>There are five other commissioned officers within the Defence Forces legal service, all qualified barristers, who advise the commanders of the various brigades and formations of the Defence Forces outside of Defence Forces Headquarters. The Department of Defence, in common with other Departments, seeks all ultimate legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. The Department also works closely with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in all legal matters.</P>
        <P>The Defence Act 1954 provides at section 15 for the office of the civilian Judge Advocate General &mdash; JAG &mdash; who is a civilian lawyer appointed by the President, acting on the advice of the Government and charged with the performance of such duties as the Government may from time to time assign. The Judge Advocate General must be a practising barrister-at-law of at least ten years&rsquo; standing at the time of the making of the appointment. Among the duties assigned are the furnishing of legal advice generally to the director of the Defence Forces legal service as regards matters of military law. The position is a part-time one and the holder is free to practice at the Bar in so far as such private practice would not be either potentially inconsistent with or prejudicial to the duties of the Office of Judge Advocate General. The civilian Judge Advocate General receives remuneration of &euro;13,417 per annum.</P>
        <P>There are no legal advisers or qualified lawyers employed in that professional capacity within the Civil Service secretariat of the Department of Defence. Individual civil servants working within the general administration of the Department may hold a legal qualification, for example, barrister-at-law. The Department of Defence includes the military branch of the Department under the title of Defence Forces Headquarters. The military branch of the Department consists of the respective offices of the Chief of Staff and of the two deputy Chiefs of Staff. The Office of the Director of the Defence Forces Legal Service and the Office of the Judge Advocate are integral parts of the Office of the deputy Chief of Staff &mdash; support. Where required, the Department obtains <Col N="583"/>any special expert legal advice through the Office of the Attorney General.</P>

        <P>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, a planning authority may not make a decision on a planning application until after a period of five weeks has elapsed since receipt of the application. The period during which the public may make submissions on a planning application is also five weeks from receipt of the application. Accordingly, a planning authority may not make a decision on a planning application, until the period for public <Col N="585"/>consultation has expired. A planning authority must make a decision on a planning application within eight weeks of receipt of the application, unless it seeks further information on the application or where the applicant consents to an extension of time.</P>
        <P>Where a planning authority seeks further information from the applicant on the application, it is required to make its decision on the application within four weeks of the request for further information being complied with or within eight weeks of the request being complied with in a case where the application is accompanied by an environmental impact statement.</P>
        <P>Under section 34(9) of the Planning and Development Act 2000-2004 the applicant, within eight weeks of receipt of the application by the planning authority, may consent in writing to an extension of the period for the planning authority to make its decision. In such a case the period for making the decision is extended for the period consented to by the applicant.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 948, 949, 951, 952, 973 and 980 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the nitrates directive was submitted to the European Commission on 29 July 2005 and the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Waters) Regulations 2005 were made on 11 December 2005. These regulations give legal effect to the action programme and respond to the judgment of the European Court of Justice in 2004, which held that Ireland was non-compliant with the nitrates directive mainly by reason of failing to make an action programme under the directive. The action programme and regulations were prepared jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food in consultation with Teagasc and involved an extensive consultation process with farming organisations and other interested parties. The regulations generally came into effect on 1 February 2006 with specific provisions being phased in over a three-year period.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the regulations deals with nutrient management planning and is based on long-standing Teagasc advice. Subsequent to the making of the regulations in December 2005, Teagasc indicated it may be possible to review part of this advice in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. My Department secured agreement with the European Commission that there was merit in allowing time for this advice to be elaborated. To this end, I announced a brief <i>de facto</i> deferral of Part 3 of the regulations.</P>
        <P>I received a copy of the Teagasc advice on phosphorus and nitrogen limits on 3 March 2006 and this, together with key additional information and research data subsequently submitted, is being considered carefully by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food. A copy of the Teagasc advice has been made available to the European Commission. A meeting was held with the European Commission on 22 March 2006 attended by officials from my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food and Teagasc. The purpose of the meeting was to present the Teagasc advice to the Commission and to have preliminary discussion and consideration of the new advice. I have held a number of meetings with the main farming organisations in recent weeks to apprise them of recent developments. As I have previously indicated, I am open to considering proposals for the more effective operation of the regulations. Any new formulation will, however, have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and will require the agreement of the European Commission.</P><Col N="587"/>
        <P>Consideration of the issues involved is being advanced by my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food and Teagasc. Appropriate amendments to the regulations need to be agreed with the Commission and finalised as a matter of urgency to enable consideration of Ireland&rsquo;s request for a derogation from 170 kg to 250 kg organic nitrogen per hectare to move forward with the Commission and other member states.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that homes protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000 need a section 57 declaration, which requires a site location map; his views on whether this is another example of a stealth tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Planning and Development Act, works to a protected structure, which in normal circumstances would be exempted development, are exempted development only if the works in question would not materially affect the character of the structure or any element of the structure that contributes to its special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. To facilitate owners or occupiers of protected structures, however, the Act provides that such an owner or occupier may make a written request to their planning authority for a declaration as to the type of works which it considers would or would not materially affect the character of the structure. This enables the owners or occupiers to identify the type of works to the structure which will not require planning permission, so removing any future necessity to apply for planning permission for such works. The legislation does not require that an application for a section 57 declaration should be accompanied by a site location map. The Deputy&rsquo;s reference to a stealth tax is, therefore, wide of the mark.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive in Ireland means that responsibility for the environmentally sound management of waste electrical and electronic equipment is a matter for the producers who place electrical and electronic equipment on the Irish market. Under the WEEE directive and the regulations which implemented it, manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment, or those importing such equipment on a professional basis into the State, may self-comply or join a collective compliance scheme to fulfil their obligations. The procurement of such services as collection and treatment of WEEE is a matter for the collective producer compliance schemes or the self-compliant producers. Anyone wishing to become involved in the environmentally sound management of WEEE from private households can engage directly with the collective compliance schemes and the self-compliant producers.</P>
        <P>My Department does not provide funding to the private sector for collection and recycling of this waste as this is now a matter for the producers. Any funding provided by my Department in the area of the recovery of waste has been to assist local authorities in the development of civic amenity sites and in meeting their operational costs. Householders and retailers may deposit WEEE free of charge at these sites.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 955 and 957 together.</P>
        <P>In 2006, I have allocated general purpose grants to local authorities amounting to &euro;875 million; this represents an increase of 6.5% over the corresponding figure for 2005, which is more than twice the current rate of inflation.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, set out provisions for the payment of fees for planning applications. Local authorities generated in excess of &euro;57 million in planning fees in 2004, the latest year for which statistics are available. Planning authorities are also entitled to require persons served with enforcement notices to pay their costs, and retain any fines paid on foot of a court conviction. Such income can also be used to fund development management and administration.</P>
        <P>The Indecon report on the review of local government financing calls for a move towards a planning system which operates at full economic cost recovery. I intend to undertake a study of the <Col N="590"/>cost of the planning service later this year with a view to reviewing the fees regulations thereafter. In the circumstances, it is not proposed to provide specific additional funding to local authorities from central government in respect of services provided by planning offices.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are responsible for the operation and maintenance of public water supply systems. I understand that the supply problem in this case was caused by a major pipe burst and that, in the course of locating and remedying the leak, Meath County Council maintained contact with affected consumers by means of leaflet drops and local radio, supplied drinking water in tankers to consumers with supply interruptions and subsequently provided advice to consumers on remedying airlocks. On the basis of this information, it is not considered that a case exists for a public inquiry into the council&rsquo;s handling of this incident. Section 212 of the Local Government Act 2001 has yet to be commenced.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 34(1) of the Waste Management Act requires that any person, other than a local authority, who is collecting waste for the purposes of reward, with a view to profit or otherwise in the course of business must obtain a waste collection permit from the relevant local authority. The fee payable in respect of an application for a collection permit is set down in article 7(3)(<i>e</i>) of the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2001 as &euro;1,200 or &euro;380 in the case of collection solely of waste oils.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have absolute discretion under Article 7(4) of the Waste Management <Col N="593"/>(Collection Permit) Regulations 2001 to refund or waive all or part of the fee payable in respect of a particular permit application in cases where they are satisfied that the payment of the full fee would not be just and reasonable having regard to the limited scale or nature of the activity to which the application relates. The consideration of waste permit applications and the decision-making process on the granting of waste collection permits, as well as ensuring compliance with the requirements of the regulations, is a matter for the local authority in whose functional area the activity will take place. My Department is precluded by law from becoming involved in individual permit applications or in the granting of waivers or refunds in respect of permit application fees.</P>
        <P>Last summer, I issued draft collection permit regulations along with draft facility permit regulations for public consultation. My Department received in excess of 50 detailed submissions on the draft regulations and these are being reviewed for the purposes of making appropriate amendments. I hope to be in a position to issue revised waste collection permit regulations in the near future.</P>
        <P>With regard to the general issue of waste charges levied for waste collection services, the present legal framework determined by the Oireachtas reflects the fact that waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges and the provision of waivers are both matters for the relevant local authority where it acts as a service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges. My Department has no function in either the setting of charges or the provision of waivers.</P>

	<P>No proposals have been received by my Department from Cork County Council for sewerage works in Carrigimina nor were any such proposals included in the list of schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to local authorities in 2003 to undertake fresh <Col N="594"/>assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas. Accordingly, no provision has been made for a proposal for Carrigimina in the water services investment programme for 2005 to 2007.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have, however, recently been asked to carry out a new assessment of needs and to review their water and waste water infrastructural priorities in light of economic, demographic and other developments that have taken place since the previous needs assessments were completed. Priorities emerging from this process will be reflected in future phases of the water services investment programme.

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s national water services pricing policy framework requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the sole exception of households using the services for domestic purposes. The capital cost of domestic water services is funded in full by the Exchequer and has benefited from a significant investment of &euro;2.7 billion since 2000. The operational cost of providing water services for domestic purposes is met by grants from the local government fund, in particular through the general purpose grant which will amount to some &euro;875 million in 2006. I believe that with prudent use of this funding and the pursuit of further efficiencies and expenditure rationalisation, local authorities will be adequately resourced to meet demands, including domestic water services provision, in 2006 and beyond.</P>

	<P>Under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-2007, Waterford County <Col N="595"/>Council has been approved for total funding of &euro;167.587 million in respect of 24 water and sewerage schemes, including an allocation of &euro;2.6 million in respect of water conservation. Three of these schemes are at construction, the Dunmore East water supply scheme is due to commence construction later this year and the remainder are in planning.</P>

	<P>The design-build-operate model, which is the preferred procurement route for water and waste water treatment infrastructure funded under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme, offers worthwhile advantages over traditional procurement, including accelerated infrastructure delivery as payments to the contractor under the service phase do not commence until construction is completed; reduced exposure to construction inflation; optimised whole life project cost through single point responsibility for design, construction, operation and maintenance; greater certainty of final capital cost from better allocation of risk; and use of newer technologies with associated technical and economic advantages.</P>
        <P>With the experience gained over a number of years now, there should be no additional delay in progressing such projects through the planning stages as compared with the traditional <Col N="597"/>procurement approach. My Department is satisfied that the 20 years whole life cost of design-build-operate projects compares favourably with traditionally procured infrastructure operating to corresponding standards and that the operation of design-build-operate projects by professional service providers under contract to the local authorities represents the optimum response to the need for long-term protection of capital assets, together with consistent compliance with statutory and other performance requirements.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 968 and 969 together.</P>
        <P>I consider it essential that the most efficient procedures are in place to ensure that water services infrastructure provision can continue to anticipate and respond effectively to demand for new or improved services. Against that background, I recently introduced new procedures to accelerate individual water and sewerage schemes through the procurement process. These procedures, drawn up in consultation with the local authorities, provide that an individual scheme with a value of up to &euro;5 million may, following preliminary approval by my Department, proceed to construction without further reference to the Department. This reduces, from four to two, the number of stages that are subject to departmental approval prior to the commencement of construction. Subject to the submission of certain limited additional information, the new procedures also apply to schemes where preliminary approval has already been received from the Department.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are responsible for the procurement and delivery of water services infrastructure in their areas. When introducing the new procedures I recognised that there may be a need, in certain circumstances, for additional staff resources at local level to ensure that experienced staff solely dedicated to water <Col N="598"/>services projects are available. Accordingly, local authorities have been advised that funding under the WSIP may be available to support project office staff structures within local authorities. Where appropriate, adjoining local authorities should co-operate in establishing regionalised project office structures to optimise the efficient use of resources.</P>
        <P>In May 2004 a new project control system, which had been developed by the water services national training group, was introduced for local authorities as a direct response to the emerging management demands on them. The system was developed to assist local authorities to manage the planning, procurement and construction stages of projects on the basis of a consistent best practice approach</P>

	<P>In law, the preparation of the register of electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns that have been expressed on the quality of the register. My Department wrote to registration authorities on 14 July 2005 and requested them to take all necessary steps to secure significant improvement in the quality of the register. A national awareness campaign was conducted in November 2005 associated with the work on preparation of the register under way at that stage.</P>
        <P>Also, in November 2005, my Department completed work on new and updated draft guidance for registration authorities on preparing and maintaining the register. The aim of the guidance is to secure significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register by setting out clearly the legal requirements in this complex area, and identifying best practice for registration authorities in their work on the register. The guidance states that the draft register should be cross-checked with other databases available to the registration authority. Following a consultation process, my Department is now finalising the guidance and, in this regard, I am considering whether the final version should include further specific text on this issue.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 974 to 977, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Feakle, Scarriff and Quilty sewerage scheme, which includes Mullagh, and the Carrigaholt, Labasheeda and Cooraclare sewerage scheme are included in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-2007 as schemes to commence construction in 2006 and 2007, respectively.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding towards the domestic share of the capital cost of water services infrastructure that is needed for environmental, economic or public health reasons <Col N="601"/>and that can be justified by reference to value for money considerations. Local authorities are responsible for designing and planning individual schemes and for ensuring that they meet the affordability criteria. In that context, the level of grant available to group water schemes, and the relative cost of proprietary single house waste water treatment systems, are regarded as a suitable guide to local authorities for assessing the cost effectiveness of proposals to serve existing dwellings, and organic growth in the residential sector, by way of new public water or waste water infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Clare County Council is reviewing the schemes with a view to devising more cost-effective solutions for each location than those originally proposed. I understand that the council is confident that a suitable and financially viable result will be found. The council&rsquo;s revised proposals will be given the earliest possible consideration on receipt in my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department has also suggested that Clare County Council&rsquo;s review might include an examination of North Tipperary County Council&rsquo;s pilot testing of septic tank effluent drainage systems, STEDS. Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the Tipperary pilot project, it would be open to other local authorities, in accordance with public procurement procedures, to invite tenders from competent contractors for the provision of STEDS-based systems at suitable locations. It would not be possible to indicate in advance what the tender cost might be in such cases, as circumstances will differ from location to location.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are required to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of householders. The cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector should be fully recovered by local authorities by means of a meter-based volumetric charge. While current arrangements for schools may, as with other non-domestic users, be based on fixed water services charges, local authorities are moving towards the metering of all non-domestic water use.</P>
        <P>The unit cost of providing water services will differ between local authorities and there is no standard rate of charging. It is therefore a matter for each authority to set the appropriate level of charges for non-domestic users of water services necessary for recovery of actual costs.</P>

	<P>The waters of Dublin Bay, along with the rivers that drain into it and the associated coastal waters and groundwaters, form part of the eastern river basin district for the purposes of the water framework directive which aims to protect and improve the quality of all waters within the European Union. Dublin City Council is the co-ordinating authority for the preparation of a single river basin management plan which must be prepared and adopted in the district by 2009 by all the relevant local authorities. In addition, there is close liaison by Dublin City Council for this purpose with numerous Departments and State agencies, including my Department; the Department of Communications, Marine and <Col N="605"/>Natural Resources; the Department of Agriculture and Food; the Office of Public Works; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Geological Survey of Ireland; and the Heritage Council.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council has a policy objective in its development plan to prepare a plan for Dublin Bay from and including North Bull Island and the South Wall and up to an including Sandymount, Merrion strand and Booterstown and also concentrated on the port area. The plan will identify and determine the role of that part of the bay as an economic, amenity, recreational, environmental and ecological resource. To progress this objective, Dublin City Council has established a multi-agency steering group, which includes representatives of my Department; the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; the Department of Transport; and Dublin Port Company. It is expected that the city council, in conjunction with the steering group, will shortly commission a wide-ranging study of Dublin Bay, including the port area, with the aim of identifying and agreeing with key stakeholders a guiding framework for its future overall development.</P>

        <P>The sustainable rural housing guidelines for planning authorities provide that development <Col N="607"/>plans should set out the categories of persons who are considered to have rural-generated housing needs. Suggested categories include persons who are an intrinsic part of the rural community such as farmers and their families, people who have lived most of their lives in rural areas and returning emigrants. Other suggested categories include persons working full-time or part-time in rural areas such as those involved in farming, forestry, inland waterway or marine related occupations, and people whose work is intrinsically linked to rural areas, such as teachers in rural schools.</P>
        <P>The guidelines make clear that the foregoing list is not intended to be exhaustive and that it is a matter for each planning authority to make its own assessment of the scope and extent of rural housing needs to be catered for in its development plan, taking account of local conditions and relevant planning issues.</P>

	<P>The sustainable rural housing guidelines for planning authorities state that planning authorities should recognise that exceptional health circumstances, supported by relevant documentation from a registered medical practitioner and a disability organisation, may require a person to live in a particular environment or close to family support. A planning authority should consider granting permission in such cases, in the absence of any strong environmental, access or traffic reasons for refusal. The application of the provisions of the guidelines in an individual case is a matter for the relevant planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la where appropriate.</P>

        <Quest>if he will put pressure on the National Roads Authority and Mayo County Council to bring the Castlebar to Belmullet road to standard as it is down to a single lane and the amount of traffic is ever-increasing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Part of the Castlebar to Belmullet road is classified as a national secondary road &mdash; the N59 &mdash; while a number of sections are non-national or regional roads. Responsibility for national roads, which include national secondary roads, is a matter for the relevant road authority and the National Roads Authority, which operates under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has no function in the funding of national roads. The provision of non-national roads in County Mayo is a matter for Mayo County Council to be funded from its own resources, supplemented by grants provided by the Department. The council has included three schemes in its restoration improvement programme which will be funded from the Department&rsquo;s 2006 restoration improvement grants scheme &mdash; the R312 Derrycoosh to Bellacorrick road; works at Cummer at a cost of <Col N="609"/>&euro;165,750 and works at Bellacorrick to Keenagh at a cost of &euro;459,082 and the R313 Bangor to Belmullet road; and works at Glencastle at a cost of &euro;315,000. In addition, under the 2006 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme, the council has been allocated a grant of &euro;1.5 million for realignment works on the Castlebar to Derrycoosh section of the R311 Castlebar to Newport road. This is the only application submitted by the council, in respect of the non-national road sections of the Castlebar to Belmullet road, for consideration for funding in 2006 under this scheme. Mayo County Council may also use the discretionary improvement grant provided by the Department towards the carrying out of such works. The discretionary improvement grant allocation to the council in 2006 is &euro;1,603,000, an increase of 7% on the 2005 initial allocation. The selection of works to be funded from this allocation is a matter for the council.</P>

	<P>My Department has no statutory function in the determination of waste charges and waivers and has not been in discussions with the Department of Finance regarding the introduction of a national waiver scheme for refuse charges. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and the provision of waivers, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.</P>
        <P>The issue of waste charges has been raised in the context of social partnership. In this context, my Department engaged with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to explore the issues involved. However, these discussions did not identify a role for the social welfare system in providing income support or allowances in relation to waste charges. </P>

        <Quest>if he accepts that there is an unfairness in the method by which the farming community are charged for the cost of meters for the supply of water to their farms; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that for many farmers, particularly in the west of Ireland who have fragmented farms, in many cases farmers with only 30 or 40 acres of land have their holdings extended across six or seven fragmented farms which means that they have to pay the full rate for six or seven meters; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that this is a major financial burden on small farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the EU water framework directive, the national water services pricing policy framework provides for the recovery by sanitary authorities of the full cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes. This policy of cost recovery from the non-domestic sector extends to the provision of meters, which are necessary to ensure water charging of users according to actual consumption.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are at an advanced stage of implementing their non-domestic metering programmes and will have substantially concluded these by the end of 2006. The metering of non-domestic water supply is also intended to incentivise all non-domestic users, including the <Col N="612"/>farming community, to manage and conserve their use of water.</P>
        <P>My Department is aware that in some situations non-domestic users, including farmers, may need to have a number of separate meters installed on their properties. Precise charging arrangements in these circumstances would be a matter for settlement locally between property owners and local authorities. However, in principle, the costs associated with the provision of water supply, including the installation of water meters, should be met by the users of the service.</P>

	<P>My Department has now received a revised preliminary report for the advancement of waste water facilities in 13 of the 16 locations included in the Roscommon towns and villages sewerage scheme in accordance with proposals agreed in principle between the Department and Roscommon County Council earlier this month. I expect formal approval of the revised preliminary report to issue shortly to the council. The scheme is approved for construction in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-2007. I understand that the council is continuing to examining the viability of the proposals for the remaining three locations in the scheme &mdash; Brideswell, Castleplunkett and Curraghboy.</P>
