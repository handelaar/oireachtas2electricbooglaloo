   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the delegation. I remind the Ceann Comhairle that his predecessor used always say c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, the 100,000 welcomes.</P>
    <P>On 31 May 2005 on the Leas Cross issue, the Taoiseach said that the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme:</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0">uncovered shocking treatment of vulnerable people in the units investigated. No excuse should be offered to defend what happened, as there is no defence for it.</P>
    <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Despite that shock and the promises the Government made, it is still failing to protect our elderly and vulnerable citizens who found themselves in <Col N="2"/>nursing homes. Last week I raised the issue of Leas Cross and the O&rsquo;Neill report into 95 deaths in that nursing home. The response was the normal response of the Government, like the three monkeys, hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. It seems that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have not seen the report, have not looked for it and do not know what it contains. It seems as if the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and other members of the Government want to hide behind a legal wall and avoid taking responsibility for what is a fundamentally serious issue.</P>
    <P>Early last year the Health Service Executive sought tenders from nursing homes for 100 high and immediate-dependency beds. Some 85 nursing homes submitted tenders in that process. All of these homes were evaluated. The second stage of that evaluation required visits to the nursing homes by representatives of the HSE. As a result of that process 15 nursing homes were awarded contracts for beds and 70 homes were unsuccessful. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, who has been pursuing the matter for some time, has been informed that the process also uncovered nursing homes with a very poor service of care for the elderly. We have also been informed that the O&rsquo;Neill report made a recommendation to the HSE in February which stated:</P><Col N="3"/>
    <P LI="1">Residents (and their families) of any nursing homes that scored poorly in the ERHA tendering process in 2005 for Heavy Dependency/Intermediate Care Beds should be informed of this as a matter of some urgency, as there is a likelihood that there are residents with high or maximum dependency in all of these nursing homes.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Is it not a shocking indictment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that this report has not been seen by the Government, has not been sought by the Government and has not been examined by the T&aacute;naiste, given that last Thursday was World Elder Abuse Awareness Day? Is it not a shocking indictment that the report contains that reference and makes it clear that in the case of those nursing homes that have been uncovered by HSE inspections as having a poor service of care, the people and their families should be informed. Nobody wants to have a relative in a nursing home where care is poor. I ask the Taoiseach to instruct the T&aacute;naiste to get a copy of the O&rsquo;Neill report today. He should ask her to identify the recommendations that can be implemented forthwith and he should order the HSE to implement those recommendations immediately.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a few points of fact. When Leas Cross was uncovered, I stated that the position was entirely unsatisfactory. The Deputy indicated that nothing was done, but we closed Leas Cross. It went out of business. Even though it was a new building, because the standards of care and attention to elderly people were nowhere near the acceptable standard, it was closed down and Leas Cross has not been in operation since.</P>
    <P>As I told the Deputy last week, I understand the O&rsquo;Neill report is with the HSE. There are a number of legal ramifications arising out of that report which must be resolved before the report is published, if it can be published. However, that is a matter of legal practice and the Deputy knows that cannot be breached until it is resolved by the HSE. It has not been given to the Government. It is not a question that the T&aacute;naiste can demand the report when the HSE, on legal advice, is dealing with issues. Obviously, the HSE will be aware of the recommendations arising from it and since last year has been enhancing its existing inspectorate and preparing for the legislation for the new health quality authority. As I said last week, the Bill should be taken in the House later this year.</P>
    <P>The HSE has commissioned and sought additional beds from several nursing homes. It has done that successfully and has moved patients from acute hospitals into nursing home care. These are people who cannot go home owing to <Col N="4"/>various circumstances. By and large their accommodation is funded by the budget of the HSE, which is a dramatic improvement on what happened previously. I assure the Deputy that any recommendations that come to Government will be considered. Our nursing homes are governed by fairly strict conditions. If people break the law &mdash; the law has been strengthened &mdash; it will be enforced and we will continue to do that. I will not repeat what I said last week when I outlined a whole host of schemes for the elderly that were enhanced last year, including the inspectorate and care for the elderly in nursing homes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about the ramifications of what the Taoiseach has said. As I stated, he indicated last year that no excuse should be offered to defend what happened as there is no defence for it. I agree and I want to help the Taoiseach if I can. I do not want the Government or the T&aacute;naiste to hide behind a legal wall in so far as this report is concerned. I have quoted one section of the report which states that families of patients in nursing homes that scored poorly in the tendering process for high dependency or intermediate care beds should be informed of this as a matter of urgency. In that case, there is no legal wall which it is necessary to hide behind. Surely informing the families of patients in nursing homes with a poor standard of care, as identified in the HSE visit which followed the tendering process, should have no ramifications. Does any Member of the House want to have a relative or family member in a nursing home which has been officially determined as having a poor level of service to remain in that place for one day longer?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach does not need to state that there are legal ramifications or that matters must be brought before the Cabinet. I am bringing to the attention of the Taoiseach, as the head of Government, that the words I quoted are in the report, as Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has been informed. I ask him to see to it that the families of patients in nursing homes which have been identified as providing a poor level of service are informed forthwith of that fact. The Government should not attempt to let this matter drift behind legal ramifications before the report might or might not be published. The truth is essential.</P>
    <P>It is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s duty to govern, lead and make decisions, and this is one decision I want him to make this morning in the interests of the elderly and vulnerable residents of nursing homes which the HSE has identified in its study as providing an inferior level of service. Surely there is no legal basis for not taking action immediately.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE and the former health boards have always had an inspectorate to examine nursing homes. After the appalling revelations which emerged from Leas Cross, the HSE stepped up the number and frequency of inspections to make sure nursing homes were up <Col N="5"/>to an acceptable standard. I understand this is the approach the HSE is following. We give a great deal of resources to the HSE for the beds it hires and I expect and understand that it ensures that those beds are up to the proper standard. I do not think there is any legal issue that would prevent publication of the O&rsquo;Neill report. The legal issues are around individuals&rsquo; rights and their ability to take action in cases, and they are being examined. They are not about the standards of care for the elderly.</P>
    <P>I hope and understand that, given the resources we have provided for the HSE, it has been dealing with these issues on a more active basis than it did prior to the Leas Cross report. I will make that point again to the T&aacute;naiste today. I have no doubt the HSE is doing that. If the HSE is bound to consult patients, I am sure it is doing that too. That is the function and duty of the inspectorate, which it should be fulfilling and, in so far as the point is made, I expect it is doing so. We are, now more than ever before, committing a large amount of resources to private sector nursing homes to ensure the level of care and comfort available to our elderly people is higher than ever. In return, the State &mdash; in this case, the HSE is the agency of the State &mdash; is entitled to expect the highest standards of care and attention. I am sure that where breaches occur they will be dealt with.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will recall that one of the main factors giving rise to punitive taxation over a generation was the massive, widespread and endemic scale of tax evasion. He will recall that the Minister for Finance of the day used to claim there was no pot of gold out there and it took various tribunals and good journalism to highlight that this was a society in which tax evasion was normal and that only people whose taxes were deducted at source and some other tax compliant citizens contributed to the cost of running the State&rsquo;s services. A figure was put on the scale of tax evasion by inquiries such as the Ansbacher inquiry, the NIB investigation and the DIRT investigation, which has retrieved almost &euro;1 billion for the Exchequer. We thought we were in a new era but we now read of a tax settlement of &euro;25 million, the largest in the history of the State, by a building company called Bovale Limited, the principals of which are two prominent members of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party. They are also prominent donors to his party and attendees at every significant Fianna F&aacute;il occasion. Has the Taoiseach taken action as a result of this settlement? How does the tax compliant citizen know whether this massive scale of settlement is unique to this particular building company? How are we to know whether other companies have a similar dedication to evading their tax liabilities?</P>
    <P>Tax evasion is not a victimless crime. The moneys are deprived of those who are dependent on the State for a safety net in terms of minimal welfare payments and on getting access to a <Col N="6"/>hospital bed and so on. What signal does it send out to tax compliant citizens that the perpetrators involved in this episode are feted at every significant event held by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party? Does the Taoiseach intend to take action on this matter now that it has been finally resolved and the scale of evasion has become evident to all?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that people who abuse the tax system, avoid or evade tax or operate outside the tax code are committing a serious offence against compliant taxpayers, not to mind against the law, and nobody should do that. This Government and Governments of which I have been a member have, in the past ten years and more, strengthened our legislation and enhanced the powers and capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to become a very efficient organisation in stopping breaches and defaulters.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, individual cases are not brought to the attention of the Government other than through the publication of cases by the Revenue Commissioners, a document we will all receive later in the year. I hope this case is true as it will show the success of the system and prove that the powers we have put in place, the laws we have enacted and the procedures that are operated are working effectively and that large settlements of tens of millions of pounds, the amount of money that ordinary people would not understand, are now being made by many people.</P>
    <P>Most Members of this House are not against wealth creators but we are against people operating against the laws of the land and the Revenue Commissioners. In this case, if it is true, I congratulate the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, which works with Revenue to enact the laws and procedures that ensure people are tax compliant. As far as Bovale or any other company is concerned, I am glad it was caught and has to pay up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that nobody in this House is against wealth creators. For that reason, we have a very low corporate tax regime and a number of instruments that can be used to minimise tax, yet we have this scale of evasion. With all due respect to the much improved revenue collection facilities, the settlement does not owe anything to the Revenue Commissioners but was the result of a tribunal of inquiry. The Taoiseach says we are not against wealth creators but it appears the unfortunate person who buys a house in this country has to pay a king&rsquo;s ransom in stamp duty, whereas no limits are put on the profits to be made by the big companies which build the houses. Despite that, they are not prepared to pay their due taxes.</P>
    <P>I visited the website of the company in question, which states: &ldquo;Bovale have gained an unrivalled reputation for meticulous attention to detail&rdquo;. This evasion has been going on for years but I do not know whether a file has been <Col N="7"/>referred to the DPP and did not hear the Taoiseach reply to the point that the people concerned are conspicuous at Fianna F&aacute;il events, major donors to the party and prominent in the tent at the Galway Races. They have engaged in this scale of tax evasion at a time when most citizens, notwithstanding the new affluence being experienced in this country, find it hard to make ends meet and pay their taxes as best they can. I know the situation in Revenue has improved in recent years and commend the agency on that. However, much of this evasion took place over an entire generation under the very noses of the Revenue Commissioners, with little action taken. I am satisfied the culture has changed but I am not satisfied that sufficient resources have been put into, for example, random audits of self-assessment or that the Revenue Commissioners have had the resources in recent years to apply themselves to this industry, which is a major locus of bogus subcontracting and widespread tax evasion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The settlement is to the credit of the Revenue Commissioners and the powers they possess. Tribunals carry out useful work but they do not collect taxes and cannot operate settlements or examine the issues which can lead to huge settlements such as this one. Their work is undoubtedly helpful to that but the cases have to be examined independently and verified by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>We have provided low taxes and many incentives to those who are wealthy enough to invest their money. I am not interested in rehearsing the political affiliations of the people on the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; lists.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach not embarrassed that his candidates are accepting money from these people?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan&rsquo;s leader is capable of dealing with his own question and does not need the Deputy&rsquo;s help.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>All companies and individuals should abide by the law. They should not be involved in evasion or avoidance.</P>

   </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, the Deputies do not want to listen to a serious answer. It would be interesting to look at the last list, as well as helpful in terms of highlighting some of the political affiliations of the people listed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Permanent TSB-ESRI house price index makes chilling reading for tens of thousands of young working people in need of homes. In March 1996, the average price of a home in Dublin was &euro;82,000. This year, ten years later, it is &euro;384,000, an increase of &euro;300,000. That represents a shocking &euro;30,000 increase per year, the equivalent of the current average industrial wage each year for ten years. Prices outside Dublin have increased <i>pro rata</i>. Is there any appreciation by the Government of the dire situation facing young people who earn the average industrial wage and need a home or any recognition of the hardship of young parents who are saddled with 30 and 40 year mortgages? Are members of the Government so cosseted by their massive salaries that they are oblivious to the suffering, hardship and desperation?</P>
    <P>This happened on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s watch. He failed cataclysmically to stop the unbridled speculation by developers and house builders. Of course, that was deliberate. The matter goes all the way back to the devil&rsquo;s pact made between Fianna F&aacute;il and house builders and speculators in the 1960s. They bought the party&rsquo;s councillors, who in turn corrupted planning in Dublin and, perhaps, other areas and created the nightmare we now have. They got everything they wanted. They bought the party&rsquo;s former leader, who the Taoiseach eulogised unstintingly last Friday. The VIP pen in the Donnycarney church was like a major house builders&rsquo; convention. Oddly enough, the politicians were probably the poorest people there, with the exception of some of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s colleagues who are publicans, landlords or dabblers in hair dressing salons in Moscow for the Russian <i>nouveau riche</i>.</P>
    <P>This is a serious situation, with a serious downside. Speculators are buying houses in working class communities left, right and centre. A frightening percentage of homes in hitherto stable communities are now rented. Stable communities are being replaced by transient communities, by people who are forced into the laps of landlords, such as migrant workers and those on rent supplement. That means, for a Government which is completely unprepared, massive pressures on services. The Taoiseach is recreating in 2006 the alienated and neglected communities of the 1970s and 1980s in what were extensive council housing estates, yet the Government is oblivious to this.</P>
    <P>What will the Taoiseach do during the time available to him to rectify this situation, to make homes affordable and to stabilise communities so that ordinary working people can live stable lives?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="9"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As Deputy Joe Higgins knows, house price increases are primarily driven by the increase in demand for housing which has resulted from the unprecedented growth in recent years in the population and the economy. Now that we have stopped mass emigration by working class people, unemployed trade unionists and those who lived in working class communities who had to seek refuge in Australia, Canada, the United States and Britain, people are again living in the working class areas which the Deputy and I represent. Thankfully, we have moved away from the terrible blight which affected the country from the 1920s to the end of the 1980s.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P Just="Left">The Government has taken action across a wide front to maximise access to home ownership. Thankfully, we have one of the highest home ownerships in the modern world, achieved in particular through measures which promoted a supply of housing adequate to meet demand. While house prices have increased, the cost of mortgage repayments, growth in incomes, employment, lower taxes, interest rates and availability of finance have had a positive impact on affordability. Typical outgoing as a percentage of income remains better than the position of the late 1980s, as evidenced by the report published in recent days. People are taking longer term mortgages, which reduces annual outgoings. Investment in infrastructure, streamlined planning and more effective use of land have produced record housing output. Almost 81,000 houses were built in 2005 whereas ten years ago the figure was fewer than 30,000. As a result we are producing new houses at a much faster rate than other countries. Home ownership is rising and some 20 new homes are produced annually per 1,000 of population compared to five per 1,000 in the EU. Thankfully, unlike in large parts of the EU, people are buying houses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Not the people who need them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are issues of affordability. Deputy Higgins asked what the Government is doing. Some &euro;4 billion has been invested in the programmes of affordable housing for this year and next year and 15,000 households will benefit under the affordable housing schemes in that period. The affordable schemes partnership will accelerate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area where problems are most acute. Partnership is making good progress and I appreciate the effort. These are important elements of our policy to address the affordability concerns of people.</P>
    <P>Last December we launched a new housing policy framework, &ldquo;Building sustainable communities&rdquo; to build on achievements, focus delivery and increase investment. This will ensure we improve the quality of housing in neighbourhoods, create conditions where housing output <Col N="10"/>will meet demand and provide targeted support for those with affordability problems. Social housing is of the highest standard in the State. We will continue to allocate resources, including the &euro;4 billion invested in the programmes of affordable housing and continue to make improvements in tax relief and stamp duty to help the less well off. As the population grows we must ensure that supply outstrips demand because that is the only way we can stem house price increases. I disagreed with those who stated that prices would go into reverse this year. We must build more houses to stop the rate of increase in prices and ensure we keep a satisfactory level of affordability for everyone.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>An increase of 270%.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach said nothing that will give consolation to the tens of thousands of young workers who need homes. He said nothing to console those stuck with 30 or 40 year mortgages. In fact, he lauded the concept of longer term mortgages. Some people will be saddled with mortgage repayments into their 70s. On the Taoiseach&rsquo;s watch, the price of an ordinary home increased by nine times the rate of inflation. That makes a mockery of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to so-called social partnership and the recent national wage agreement. Whereas one part of the so-called partnership is allowed to profiteer in an unbridled fashion, workers' wages do not keep pace with the price of a home for young industrial workers. If so much money is being spent on social housing, why are 50,000 families on the housing waiting list? More social houses were built in the 1930s than in recent years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is to the eternal shame of this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government. We do not hear a squawk from the Progressive Democrats about this. Naturally, as far as it is concerned, that is the capitalist market. The Taoiseach said nothing to indicate that house prices will stop increasing and gave no indication of a Government measure to stop the increase. Is that because the Government has no such measures or because the clatter of developers&rsquo; helicopters as they descend on the Fianna F&aacute;il tent at the Galway races is drowning out the calls from tens of thousands of young people and their parents to stop this scandal of unbridled profiteering in the housing market?</P>

That includes &euro;1.4 billion Exchequer provision, an increase of 13% on last year. Some 6,000 local authority houses will start this year, including units provided under various schemes. The needs of some 14,000 households will be met by a range of social and affordable housing. The most recent assessment of housing need was undertaken by local authorities. The results found that just under 44,000 households were in need of social housing, a decrease of almost 10% on the figure a few years ago.</P>

The housing framework policy, Building Sustainable Communities, includes policies to ensure an effective private housing market, increased supply and reformed social housing.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>I received a personal invitation from the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to attend the United Nations special summit on AIDS in New York in early June. The Secretary General expressed his gratitude for the important advocacy role Ireland has played with our European partners and for the significant resources we have provided to reverse the trends of the epidemic.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I had attended the first UN special session on HIV-AIDS in New York five years ago. At the time, Ireland, with the other member states, adopted a declaration of commitment on HIV-AIDS. In addition, I committed Ireland to increasing spending on the fight against HIV-AIDS to &euro;30 million a year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this year&rsquo;s high level meeting was to review the progress achieved in realising the targets set out five years ago. The meeting was attended by Heads of State and Government and representatives from civil society and the private sector. I was accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for development co-operation, Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In my address to the General Assembly, I stressed that the fight against AIDS remains one of the greatest challenges of our generation. I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment, made in September 2005, to increase Government expenditure on HIV and other poverty-related diseases to &euro;100 million per year. I also reiterated the commitment of the Irish Government to reach the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national product on official development assistance by 2012. This major scaling up of the Irish aid programme will allow Ireland to be at the forefront of the fight against HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>I had a bilateral meeting with Secretary General, Kofi Annan. I presented him with a report of the Irish Government&rsquo;s response to the challenge of HIV-AIDS in developing countries from 2001 to 2006. This report clearly demonstrates that Ireland has lived up to the commitments we made five years ago. I stressed Ireland&rsquo;s determination to remain in the vanguard of the global response to HIV-AIDS. I also mentioned the Government&rsquo;s intention to publish Ireland&rsquo;s first White Paper on development co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General thanked me for attending the high level meeting on HIV-AIDS and for our continued strong support for the UN campaign against the disease. He said that the <Col N="15"/>UN could have no better partner than Ireland and thanked me for our efforts at EU level. He remarked that much had been achieved in the global campaign against HIV-AIDS but an effort was still needed to sensitise more world leaders.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General also expressed gratitude for Ireland&rsquo;s willingness to extend the participation of our peacekeeping troops in Liberia until 2007. He hoped our commitment to peacekeeping operations in Africa would encourage other western countries to follow suit because many countries have been reluctant to send peacekeeping troops in recent years. I said that the Government would consider any request to send troops to Darfur in Sudan but we would not be in a position to do so until our mission in Liberia had ended.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General and I also discussed international issues, including Iran and the Middle East. I expressed our full support for the efforts of the EU 3 to achieve a diplomatic settlement to the current dispute with Iran. The Secretary General stressed the importance that all sides, including the US and Iran, must come to the negotiating table without any preconditions.</P>
    <P>On the Middle East, the Secretary General welcomed the efforts of President Abbas to secure the agreement of Hamas to negotiate with Israel on the basis of two states founded on the 1967 borders. He also expressed concern at the current serious humanitarian situation in the occupied territories.</P>
    <P>While in New York, I attended a business lunch with senior Irish-American executives of US companies. I also attended various business related events organised by Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>I received a courtesy call from His Excellency, Mr. Mustafa Abubakar, the Governor of Aceh in Indonesia, on 17 May. It was a very brief but cordial meeting. Our discussion focused on the devastation of Indonesia by the tsunami of 2004 and the subsequent recovery work. The governor thanked Ireland for our generous contribution to the relief and recovery effort, and the ongoing contacts.</P>
    <P>I did not attend the June European Council owing to the death of former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey. The Minister for Foreign Affairs attended the Council in my place. As I will make a statement on the Council shortly, I will at this stage merely give a summary account of its proceedings.</P>
    <P>The June European Council considered a wide range of issues on the European agenda. In particular, it examined how Europe listens to and works for its citizens and how the future of European debate and the period of reflection on the European Constitution are to be carried forward. It is not possible to divorce the debate on the European Constitution from the day-to-day business of the Union. If we can convince people that their daily concerns are being met, if the broad economic climate in the Union improves and con<Col N="16"/>fidence recovers, and if we can create more jobs and give hope to the unemployed, the prospects for the European Constitution will improve.</P>

	<P>Will the Taoiseach note that I welcome his commitment at the United Nations in New York to increase Government spending on development aid to tackle HIV and other communicable diseases? Will he confirm that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to live up to the new commitment of ensuring the delivery of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid by 2012? As he knows, the earlier commitment was to have been by 2007?</P>
    <P>As part of that new commitment, will the Taoiseach undertake to exclude from the calculation of 0.7% of GNP the money the Government devotes to debt relief? Will he note that I am aware that it is permissible to allocate money in this way and that I made the point in the House only last week that it is objectionable? Is he aware that many of the international aid organisations have highlighted that money is being allocated by governments, including the Irish Government, to pay for the administrative costs of debt relief? Does he not agree that it would be more appropriate for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in to return to the questions submitted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;had been directed to tackle HIV and other communicable diseases in the world, a greater service to humanity would have been achieved?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first two questions, I reiterate our commitment to increase expenditure on HIV and other poverty related diseases to &euro;100 million per year. This is a target we can achieve. It is a considerable support from this country to the HIV campaign. We are to the fore<Col N="17"/>front of the campaign and recognised as such for the efforts that we, as a small country, have put in. Through our missionaries working in Africa, through our non-governmental organisations working in so many countries, through Irish Aid officials and through the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution which broadly has support, we are seen as being a leader in this regard. Our making such a contribution over the past five years has given us a strong leadership role in Europe and it has been recognised throughout the UN organisations and in the European Union that we hold that position. It is a role of which we all should be proud and which we should seek to maintain.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the commitment that we will reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance by 2012. We can do that. We could not reach the earlier date but we have still done better than practically any country, perhaps with the exception of Norway which has sufficient oil reserves to allow it to do it but to which I give credit for what it has done.</P>
    <P>Our rate of increase &mdash; this year we are contributing 0.5% &mdash; is an enormous contribution by the public to overseas development aid, and is recognised as such. Ireland is held in high regard in the UN and in the countries in need of this aid. In that, along with the Clinton effort in Mozambique and other countries where Ireland has a strong leadership role, we play a significant part.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing with the ODA issue for many years and, unlike most countries, Ireland is extremely fair in calculating such aid. We only provide untied aid or direct funding for relief. Many countries use a broad definition regarding what can go into ODA and they tie aid to business contracts and so on. Ireland does not do that. Nobody can criticise what Ireland includes in these figures. I have criticised the way other countries give relief and tie it to business arrangements and contracts. This country does not engage in such practices and we should never be apologetic about how we calculate ODA.</P>
    <P>With regard to debt relief, if a country is saddled with a debt and the debt is removed, that helps the country because it does not have to put its limited income towards repaying the debt. That is clearly classified as aid and that cannot be taken out of the figures.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>But there is no practical return.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If such countries do not have to repay debts, they can use the money they save for their health and social programmes and, therefore, there is a direct return. I do not agree with including other costs, but that is a fair and legitimate cost. I do not agree with the tied aid cost or other imaginative mathematical equations used by other countries.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for his support in this area. The challenges ahead are huge. The figures are <Col N="18"/>still enormous, though controls have been implemented and successes achieved in some countries. The epidemic among young parents has resulted in a significant number of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world. Ireland has tended to concentrate its effort in Africa and this epidemic is a major problem. It will take many years of work and fighting to make progress on the drugs issue. However, Ireland is in a good position for the reasons I outlined, not least the work of our missionaries and NGOs. It is an area in which we should continue to give a leadership role.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with much of what the Taoiseach said in respect of Irish missionaries and NGOs and the work they do. A suggestion was brought to my attention, which might be of interest to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence, who is also present. One of the problems people have is with the translation of money they donate and funding provided by the Government into action on HIV-AIDS or whatever and its practical effect. I recently had a conversation with Captain Mark Mellet of the LE<i> Eithne</i>, which has just returned from Argentina and he made a practical suggestion, given that the Government must consider the replacement of defence vessels over the next few years. The LE<i> Eithne</i> has a fully equipped theatre and can accommodate up to 200 people. Both Captain Mellet and Dr. James O&rsquo;Reilly, former president of the IMO, have pointed out that many Irish medics would like to use their expertise in providing public service internationally and that could be provided in Liberia, Madagascar and so on without the normal restrictions within which the Minster for Defence must operate in sending a battalion of soldiers abroad, setting up a camp and so on.</P>
    <P>The Government could consider such an opportunity. A facility could be provided without restriction, which would allow hundreds of doctors to give ten days, three weeks or a month of their time on board the ship to vaccinate and treat people with HIV-AIDS in a foreign port. It is a practical suggestion the Minister for Defence might consider. It would also deal with the direct evidence being transmitted back here publicly of how people&rsquo;s money is being used to practical effect in Africa. As the Taoiseach rightly said, Ireland concentrates on Africa and that is an added dimension the Minister for Defence and the Government could consider. A number of doctors, nurses and other medical professionals would like to avail of such a possibility. I acknowledge that a number of them help out in various capacities currently but this suggestion would mean a ship would be provided and Ireland could add a new dimension to its leadership while having practical effect in the treatment of HIV-AIDS.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="19"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hugely support volunteerism at home and abroad. All our main NGOs constantly seek volunteers and leave arrangements are made for those who travel. I would broadly support examining anything that helps in this regard. In principle, without examining the practicality, I favour anything that encourages people and makes it easier for them to provide their expertise for a period abroad. A number of arrangements are in place whereby people can get leave, particularly if there is a famine or epidemic. Members of the Defence Forces Reserve might be interested in travelling too. I referred to Darfur in my original reply, where there are major humanitarian issues and the UN is stretched. The organisation wants to move forward. Kofi Annan pressed me to engage the Irish Army in Darfur to give a lead to other countries. However, while we could do that, it is only a few months since he asked me to retain the mission in Liberia but the Army wanted to finish there. Next year, if we can find an alternative arrangement for Liberia, we can look to Darfur.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is a major life experience for people to serve on these missions. The State should do everything it can to give people that professional experience. Many voluntary groups have pulled together. For example, the Tracy Piggot Sports Group and Niall Mellon bring people together to travel to Africa, separate from the NGOs, and they should be facilitated. They do an amount of good for the communities involved but they also find it to be a significant experience. Mr. Kader Asmal paid me a courtesy call a few weeks back and he said that stories of the Irish doing this work receives huge coverage and attention, mainly because very few other countries do it, which is surprising. We will do whatever we can to facilitate that type of effort. The Minister for Defence has been listening here and he said he will examine the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The value of the suggestion is that the ship is a self-contained unit that can be tied up at a pier. The Minister for Defence does not need to have diplomatic relations with the country concerned nor does he need to provide facilities. Were the situation to get out of hand the ship could turn round in an instant and come home. A combination of the State wanting to do this and the medical professionals being willing to assist could be outstanding for the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will definitely examine this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the budget for the campaign to combat stigma and discrimination against people with HIV-AIDS in Ireland? Who is responsible for running the campaign? Have there been discussions with the relevant voluntary organisations?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="20"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years, a number of the relevant groups and bodies have raised this issue directly with me. They pointed out to me the areas of discrimination and their difficulties in receiving treatment. In the main such treatment is provided through the hospital network. It is the policy of the Department of Health and Children and, by extension, of the HSE, that arrangements should be made for their treatment, that the individuals who deal with them should have more sensitivity training, and if necessary, that the patients can be assisted by receiving counselling. The groups made the point that while they are obliged to receive the treatment, it could be perceived that they are discriminated against, or made to feel that this is a terrible disaster which isolates them. The groups do not complain of the treatment but about the perception. In this regard, I am told by the Department that the hospitals do not consider this to be a difficult area.</P>
    <P>While a resource issue exists, it is not a major financial issue. People are quite happy with it. The proposed improvements might require differing clinic times or facilities. Moreover, one should avoid locating an AIDS clinic in the middle of an outpatient clinic, where people are made to feel they are sitting there in isolation. This issue simply requires some sensitivity towards individuals, who badly need treatment, as many are in poor health.</P>
    <P>The groups made a good case and the agencies here have been receptive to it. This is achievable without too much difficulty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>On foot of the summit on AIDS, what kind of perspective was put forward with regard to, for example, the 26 million people in Africa who live with HIV-AIDS, of whom only 1% receive anti-AIDS drugs? Internationally, what kind of perspective was outlined in respect of the 40 million or so people with AIDS, of whom perhaps 5% receive anti-retroviral drugs treatment? Was a perspective offered as to when the resources might be made available in order that each human being who needs it is provided with treatment, which has dramatically prolonged life for those suffering in richer countries?</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke, did he allude to the fact that a fraction of the armaments spending of the major countries could provide this treatment and could create a significant impetus to wipe out AIDS? Did he complain about that?</P>
    <P>As for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with Mr. Mustafa Abubakar, the governor of Aceh, Indonesia, did he discuss the human rights situation in Aceh in the wake of the decades-long insurgency, the demand for self-determination and some shaky agreements which have been made more recently as to what is the position of the Indonesian Government regarding the guarantee of full human and political rights to the people of Aceh?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="21"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Joe Higgins is correct with regard to armaments in Africa. Five civil wars are underway there at present, and in their absence, the amount of available resources in the affected countries and in the region generally would massively help their development. This has been an ongoing issue for the past ten or 20 years, since the early 1980s. It has been an issue since AIDS ravished these countries, from 1982 onwards.</P>
    <P>However, greater co-operation exists in this respect than was evident five years ago, or than was visible at some of the World Bank conferences which I attended more than ten years ago. At least, the African nations, groups and bodies are making an effort to deal with these issues, to help one another and to move away from such wars. While I would like to be able to state they are making considerable progress, at least they appear to be making some progress. An enormous amount of money is involved. While everyone makes this point, it probably goes over the head of most of those who are involved in the various wars and related activities.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues, including the availability of drugs. The objective is to be able to acquire drugs at prices which are affordable to such people. The only way to do so quickly is through the co-operation of the drug companies and member states. This has improved dramatically and while it is costly, it remains the best course of action. This has helped and stabilised the situation in many countries.</P>
    <P>However, this does not really reverse the enormous numbers of people who suffer from HIV-AIDS. The figures throughout most of the states, with a few exceptions, are still frightening. The Irish aid effort is to try to pick individual places, such as the Mozambique programme, and Kenya, and to try to have an impact on them. However, a more dramatic impact could be made if everyone gave a fair slice of resources.</P>
    <P>As for my meeting with the governor of Aceh, I did not have a long discussion with him. They are making some progress with the Indonesians and are hopeful that, with much regional assistance, further progress will be made.</P>
    <P>Most of my discussions pertained to the humanitarian effort and to the number of Irish groups which have direct involvement there and which not only contributed aid but which still provide help and assistance. However, the Achenese have a sense that in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy and the devastation it caused, they are making some progress on their political agenda. Nevertheless, they remain in a frightful position. It will take them a number of years to stabilise the tsunami&rsquo;s effects. Obviously, they were thankful to Ireland for the relief and recovery effort and appealed for such efforts to be continued for some time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for not hearing the Taoiseach&rsquo;s original reply. The Taoiseach is <Col N="22"/>aware that he was criticised for attending the UN conference on AIDS. Does he agree that much of this criticism was unwarranted? I was glad he attended and can confirm that his speech was well received at the UN, particularly by the African nations. I was sitting beside the delegation from Lesotho, which was very happy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy wish to ask a question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not often get the opportunity to praise the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Ceann Comhairle wishes to complain, that is fine.</P>
    <P>It was noticeable that many world leaders did not turn up at the UN. Does the Taoiseach agree this was regrettable? Can he explain the reluctance on the part of world leaders to take the problem of AIDS seriously? As the Taoiseach is aware, it is a major problem which has devastated Africa. Is it the case that such leaders simply bury their heads in the sand?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his comments. I also appreciate his involvement in the meetings related to the summit.</P>
    <P>In common with many other matters, Ireland&rsquo;s position in this regard is not widely understood at home. Our role has nothing to do with me personally. Ireland has played a role in this regard for the past ten years through its non-governmental organisations, religious orders and general efforts.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, many world leaders could not care less. They do not pay much interest to the 0.7% target or the AIDS issue. I know this because for the past decade, I have been in touch with the United Nations organisations which deal with these issues. They frequently come to Dublin and Europe and I always make a point of meeting them. A host of significant and wealthy countries do not consider this to be a major issue on their doorsteps, so &mdash; <i>que sera</i>. That is regrettable. I have been a plague on my colleagues in Europe for the past nine years on this issue. We made them suffer a fair bit during the Irish Presidency through the efforts which can be made during a presidency. Unfortunately, it is a problem that a number of countries do not see as a major item for the agenda. They speak about the immigration issue but ignore Africa on the other issue. They have it wrong and they are well used to listening to my view on this. Some take a different view. Some non-EU countries such as Norway and Luxembourg play a part in this. It is important that we continue trying to highlight it.</P>
    <P>There is huge respect for Ireland in Africa. The last time we stood for a vote in the United Nations, which was to do with this type of issue, <Col N="23"/>every country in Africa without exception supported Ireland. They hold in huge regard the resources we give and the respect Irish people have given for generations, at one time it was missionaries and now, increasingly, it is NGOs and many civic groups. This is not a small issue, it is a major one and this country should keep pursuing it.</P>
    <P>The programmes in which we are involved in Mozambique have made an extraordinary impact even though we are only a small country. If bigger countries engaged, it could have an enormous impact. Otherwise, we will always be trying to stabilise the situation. In five years time there will only be slight reductions whereas if others engaged in it in a major way, took it seriously and listened to Kofi Annan and the UN bodies working on it, it could make a huge impact. That is not the case today. The UN and EU conferences we held here were hugely important. We must try to keep those initiatives going every few years, perhaps not every year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be useful if we had an opportunity to discuss the progress towards the world millennium development goals, not just in this House but in Europe. I understand the former minister Eveline Herfkens was appointed to liaise with parliaments across Europe and elsewhere, to oversee the progress of the goals, one of which is the reduction in AIDS. Does the Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan, have any proposals to fill the gap in the pledged amount for AIDS? I understand what was pledged is less than 40% of what is required. That being the case, what specific proposals has he to deal with the shortfall, specifically the big gap looming regarding the large number of AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa? Survival is not the only issue they face, as it appears little provision is made for the further education of such orphans. I cannot remember the figure at present.</P>
    <P>I sense the despair in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments on Mozambique. However, it was pointed out by one leading NGO that it is easier to buy small arms in Mozambique than it is to get loaves of bread, not to speak of retro-viral drugs. Is there to be a debate on where we are regarding the millennium development goals, specifically the AIDS goal? What specific provision is there on the level of United Nations contingency on the failure of the pledged funds to materialise and on the growing number of orphans not related to their communities for whom provision cannot be made?</P>
    <P>As we enter the trade talks is it the case that patent rights on some drugs will finally be removed to enable countries to produce the drugs at much less cost?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The important matter emphasised when I met many African organisations while I was there, is the provision of drugs. A <Col N="24"/>great deal of progress is being made on that, but not enough. The drug companies should be prepared to put in enormous amounts. It would be good for them, would not cost them a great deal and they would receive support for that. Drugs can have major and quick success. It could change things in a four or five year period. That is the biggest effort to be made.</P>
    <P>In our case, we increased from &euro;30 million to &euro;100 million per year, which is substantial. Regarding the point I made earlier to Deputy Gormley, other countries must also make the effort. If everyone even doubled the amount given &mdash; we trebled it &mdash; it would provide the ability to obtain large quantities of drugs. The network is fairly good in most countries, perhaps not in all, but in Mozambique the network is good. One can easily distribute drugs.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The point made by Deputy Michael Higgins on orphans refers to a huge problem. Lesotho, a small country where we have taken a lead role for 25 years as I know Deputy Higgins is well aware, has stabilised its political system and the Government is now in control. Its Prime Minister came here one or two years ago and our President visited there. We have a very good relationship. However, the situation regarding the orphans in rural communities has not greatly improved. Only a small percentage of adults are there now. They have been wiped out from the mountains and farms which creates a huge problem for the future. In half of the families, the lead person is under 18 years of age. Older brothers and sisters now lead families. That creates huge problems. People have no education because once they are 15 years old they must work.</P>
    <P>Last September there was a meeting on the review of the millennium goals. Kofi Annan set out in his report what is to be done by everybody. It is a question of whether the large countries in particular will give. There was some success last year through the G8 meeting and the work of Bono, Geldof and other lobbies last year. It will be interesting to see whether those commitments will be delivered. I am not sure they will. However, at least there is a blueprint to try to make people deliver.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to ask a question. However, I first say how much I, as an Irish person, appreciate what is contributed to African countries by the Irish Government. Irish people can be very proud of it. Irish aid is a good way to help countries in Africa deal with this problem in a rational and coherent way. However, it is still less than is needed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>This proposal is before the House because the Whips and Opposition spokespersons forced the Government to do a U-turn regarding the Criminal Justice Bill, which it intended to rush through the House this week. It is a surrogate measure introduced to fill the gap. It appears we are into guillotine time again coming up to the end of the D&aacute;il session. I acknowledge that Deputy Kitt, the Government Chief Whip, has, by and large, avoided guillotines in the House. We are not opposed to the Bill and our spokesperson, Deputy Shortall, generally welcomed it last night, but this is not the point I want to make. The legislation was in the hatchery for approximately three years and has suddenly been produced on the floor of the House a couple of days before the recess. We are told it must be rushed through and this is bad management and bad parliamentary practice. The procedure leads to bad law and the likelihood of a subsequent challenge thereto. The Labour Party opposes rushing legislation through the House in this manner.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party is also unhappy with the proposals for a guillotine. Several Opposition party Members indicated they did not intend to oppose the Bill on Second Stage but I am anxious that, in the unlikely event of a vote being called at 7 p.m., the Government will allow for an informal arrangement such that 90 minutes will be allocated for Private Members&rsquo; time.

	<P>I wish to record our objection to the utilisation of the guillotine on Second Stage of the Road Traffic Bill. Contrary to recent commentary outside this House, the reality is that Members of all views are anxious to see this legislation progress speedily and that it be all-encompassing. It contains deficiencies that we would like to see addressed, but I do not believe a guillotine is the mechanism by which we will ensure the best outcome to all the necessary deliberations. Accordingly, I ask the Taoiseach to withdraw the application of the guillotine and respect the good judgment of Members, who share his willingness to see the Bill progress as speedily as possible.</P>

   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Stagg for acknowledging that we have tried to avoid guillotines since October. Inevitably, as we approach the end of the session, we must get the legislation through. I take the point that if all Bills were ready and out of the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel and the Departments, the problem might never arise. However, there are always issues to be examined and the process does not always work in a perfect way. I acknowledge that but is not necessarily anyone&rsquo;s fault; it is just the way the parliamentary session works. In the remainder of the session, we must try to complete some important Bills and there is no way of doing so in the limited time available other than that proposed. I cannot change that.</P>

Now, six years later, we are only to receive the report after the D&aacute;il goes into recess. This is not demonstrating any respect for either the Carthy family or this House.

	<P>I answered a question on the first one earlier. The heads of the Bill are being prepared. On the register, it is not possible to give an indication on that. The Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children are in discussions on the establishment of a pre-employment consultancy service. Those discussions are not yet complete. We were unable to <Col N="31"/>proceed with what we were endeavouring to do because of the North-South Ministerial Council not being in operation but they are examining it to see if they can do it by way of this pre-employment consultancy service.</P>

   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Council took place in Brussels on 15 and 16 June. In advance of the meeting, I informed Chancellor Sch&uuml;ssel of Austria, the President in office of the European Council, that I would be unable to attend as the State funeral of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, coincided with the European Council.</P>
    <P>Before the European Council, I spoke with the Chancellor, and also with Commission President Barroso, and conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s views on some of the key issues on the European Council&rsquo;s agenda.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State for European affairs, Deputy Noel Treacy, represented Ireland at the European Council. The conclusions have been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The June European Council took place just over a year after the French and Dutch referendums on the European constitution. At the June 2005 European Council, the Heads of State or Government agreed to have a period of reflection and debate in all of the member states. The Council also agreed to come back to the matter in 2006 to have an overall assessment of the national debates and decide how best to proceed.</P>
    <P>During the period of reflection, we have done much in Ireland to encourage debate and engagement with the European Union. The Government, the National Forum on Europe, Europe Day in the D&aacute;il, activities undertaken by the European Movement and others have all encouraged people to focus on the challenges facing the European Union. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has issued a short report on the period of reflection in Ireland which is available on his Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>The European Council agreed to extend the period of reflection. More time and further work are needed before firm decisions on the future of the constitutional treaty can be taken. This reflects the reality that there are different views on what to do. Ireland remains firmly committed to the constitution. We want it to enter into force as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>The Council&rsquo;s conclusions noted that 15 member states have now ratified the constitution and expressed the hope that the ratification process will be completed in line with the conclusions of the June 2005 European Council. This belies the notion that the constitution has been abandoned. It remains at the centre of the ongoing debate about the future of Europe.</P>
    <P>The European Council approved a two-track approach during the period ahead: the delivery of concrete results for the public and, at the same time, extensive consultations on the constitution, which will result in a report to next June&rsquo;s European Council on the way forward. We will support both the Finnish and German Presidencies in this work.</P><Col N="33"/>
    <P Just="Left">The conclusions mention 2008 as a date by which necessary steps will have been taken to allow the process advance. This represents a shared commitment to take the necessary decisions by that time. This reinforces the widely held view that while the way forward is very far from clear, it will begin to become clearer next year. In the meantime, the EU will work hard on its challenging agenda. The message we have taken over the past year is that the public is interested in the Union delivering results. I have been emphasising this point in my interventions at the Council and it is generally accepted.</P>
    <P>The European Union will push ahead to fight crime and terrorism, deal with the challenges of energy and climate change, promote economic growth and job creation under the revitalised Lisbon Agenda and pursue initiatives on roaming charges and other issues that strike a chord with the citizen. It is important to keep in mind that Europe continues to work and nowhere is this more the case than the continuing success of the euro. The European Council agreed that Slovenia would adopt the single currency in January 2007. The entry of one of the new member states to the eurozone marks a watershed in the process of European integration.</P>
    <P>The Council also commended Lithuania for its progress towards meeting the criteria for the single currency. While Lithuania was disappointed that its entry to the eurozone was not proposed by the European Commission on this occasion, I am confident that Lithuania and the other new member states will be admitted in the near future.</P>
    <P>The European Council also supported useful work underway to ensure that EU citizens can avail of the consular services of all the member states around the world. Every year EU citizens take over 180 million trips outside of the EU. It makes sense that the member states should co-operate more closely in providing a first class consular service to our citizens. This will also be of benefit to our people who are travelling ever more extensively around the world.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the National Forum on Europe and the Oireachtas will continue to play the central roles in stimulating debate and raising awareness of key European issues which affect our country and its people. In addition to this delivery agenda, the European Council took some steps to bring EU decision-making closer to the citizen. It adopted an overall policy on transparency which provides that all Council deliberations under the co-decision procedure shall now be public. Ireland has strongly supported efforts to make the Council of Ministers more open, especially when it is legislating. This represents important progress.</P>
    <P>The European Council also welcomed the recent commitment by the Commission to make all new proposals and consultation papers directly available to national parliaments, inviting them to react so as to improve the process of policy formulation. The European Council asked the <Col N="34"/>Commission to consider comments by national parliaments, in particular with regard to the subsidiarity and proportionality principles.</P>
    <P>The European Council also discussed the future enlargement of the Union. On the one hand, there is widespread recognition that the accession of the ten new member states has been a great success. It has given tangible proof that Europe can be reunited after more than half a century of imposed division. The prospect of EU membership is a huge incentive for encouraging reform and stability in neighbouring countries of great significance to the EU. On the other hand, we know the EU must manage the process carefully. We cannot become over-extended or over-burdened. The European Commission will issue a report on future enlargement, including the EU&rsquo;s absorption capacity, in the autumn. This specific analysis will include the issue of the present and future perception of enlargement by citizens and will take into account the need to explain the enlargement process adequately to the public within the Union.</P>
    <P>The December 2006 European Council will debate all aspects of future enlargement. The European Council reaffirmed our common objective of welcoming Bulgaria and Romania as full members of the EU in January 2007. It called on both countries to tackle without delay the remaining issues of concern mentioned in the Commission&rsquo;s May 2006 report. The European Council welcomed the start of substantive accession negotiations with Turkey. It recalled that the negotiating framework for accession negotiations with Turkey includes the fulfilment of Turkey&rsquo;s obligations under the association agreement and under its additional protocol. There will be a full evaluation in December of the implementation of these commitments. The European Council also welcomed the start of substantive accession negotiations with Croatia. It encouraged Croatia to continue its reform efforts and to achieve sustainable progress towards the fulfilment of EU standards.</P>
    <P Just="Left">On the external relations side, the European Council adopted declarations on the western Balkans, Iran, Iraq, the Middle East peace process, Africa, Lebanon and Timor-Ieste. On the Middle East peace process, it endorsed the proposed temporary international mechanism, which has been drawn up by the European Commission, to channel assistance directly to the Palestinian people. The mechanism will focus on essential supplies and running costs for social services and health, the supply of utilities, including fuel, and social allowances. The European Community stands ready to contribute a substantial amount to the international mechanism. The European Council urged Iran to give an early positive response to the far-reaching initiative proposed by the EU High Representative, the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, the UK, China, the Russian Federation and the United States.</P><Col N="35"/>
    <P Just="Left">Overall, the recent European Council was an opportunity to take stock of where Europe now stands both in terms of work designed to meet the expectations of our people and also on the future of the European constitution. The general focus now is on showing the people of Europe that, by working effectively together, we can deliver real benefits on their behalf. There is a broad acceptance, however, that in order to ensure the European Union can face up to intensifying external competition, and also deal with its internal economic and social challenges, we will have to return to the European constitution. We all want to ensure that this future discussion is properly prepared and takes place in the right context. The recent European Council, therefore, took important decisions to achieve this objective. In showing that Europe continues to progress and develop, it gave a clear signal that Europe is determined to overcome the current difficulties as regards the ratification of the European Constitution.</P>
    <P>I extend my congratulations to Chancellor Wolfgang Sch&uuml;ssel and his team for conducting an excellent Presidency at a difficult time for the European Union. We have enjoyed excellent co-operation with the Austrian Presidency which was conducted in an effective and efficient way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that Chancellor Sch&uuml;ssel did an excellent job in the performance of his duties as President.</P>
    <P>At last week&rsquo;s EU Summit, once again it was perfectly clear that as a community we have rather a long way to go towards meeting the ambitious objectives set out in the Lisbon Agenda &mdash; to make the most comprehensive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world by 2010. That is practically unachievable from my perspective of what is happening. Certainly, there has been some progress. As we saw again last week, however, even with the relaunch of the Lisbon Agenda by the Commission last year, focusing on growth and jobs, it is perfectly obvious that the reform necessary to see our Union reach these targets is simply not fast enough. Consequently the innovation gap between Europe and the US continues to grow and the fact that China, for instance, builds more airports, roads and bridges in five years than the EU and the US combined build in 20, should spur us on to try to reach the Lisbon objectives and secure the future of the Union in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The March EU Summit took place under something of a cloud. Last week&rsquo;s Summit coincided with the popular preoccupation with the World Cup. The business of the Summit certainly was not earth shattering. The year 2008 was set as the target for making changes to the rule book, allowing further expansion. Decisions were made to televise ministerial meetings, to honour commitments made to those countries that want to join the EU. A plan was backed for donors to <Col N="36"/>release emergency aid to the Palestinians, bypassing the Hamas-led government. Energy, security and diversification moved up the EU agenda.</P>
    <P>There were a few happy faces, the Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson being one of them. He abandoned the usually cool Scandinavian tradition to let out a few guttural screams when Sweden beat Paraguay one nil. The Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa also looked happy, not because of football, but because of his economy. Booming Slovenia has been quick to meet the Maastricht criteria and will be the first of the ten new members to join the eurozone. Chancellor Merkel, my fellow EPP member, looked happy at the prospect of taking over the EU Presidency in 2007. An ardent supporter of the EU constitution, she intends to do everything she can to accelerate movement on this somewhat fatigued issue.</P>
    <P>The period of reflection on the EU constitution is to be extended. We certainly need more time, but the constitution could be stranded unless we move with some alacrity to sell it to our citizens as a powerful, democratic, transparent entity capable of effecting real results and making real change. Here at home, we must re-ignite the public debate with a view to reactivating the ratification process. It is time to evangelise, answer, explain, persuade and communicate by every means possible the why of Europe to the peoples it serves.</P>
    <P>The people of Europe feel they do not own their Union and it is no wonder. They see it as a bureaucracy-laden, inefficient policy club. Our challenge and duty is to present the EU to the public as a genuinely reforming, effective working group. We must make the workings of the EU more democratic and transparent. We must start talking to people about the bread and butter European issues so that they can at last start to feel like the Union is their own and that they are the ones in charge.</P>
    <P>That said, it was domestic politics, not EU politics, that saw the constitution fail in France and the Netherlands. President Chirac, in particular, was stymied on Europe owing to mass protests at unpopular employment legislation designed to tackle rigidities in the market. There is also what has been called &ldquo;economic nationalism&rdquo; overshadowing the Union&rsquo;s stated ambition under the Lisbon Agenda to be more competitive in the globalised world. At the March summit, President Chirac and Chancellor Merkel disagreed publicly about our economic future, with the latter criticising French attempts to limit foreign investment.</P>
    <P>The tradition of individual rights is one of the great realisations of European civilisation, but there is a danger for Europe and the EU when we start to ring-fence the rights and demands of the individual state without thinking about how they connect with the needs and good of the community. We have seen this economic introspection in recent months and it should not be <Col N="37"/>allowed to continue. We cannot be open for business with the rest of the world and be closed to each other.</P>
    <P>I am glad that energy security and diversity moved up the EU agenda. Energy has become increasingly scarce and increasingly geopolitical. The conclusions of the summit called for an energy policy for Europe that reviews oil and gas stocks and develops internal electricity and gas markets. At the time, I suggested that Ireland join a single EU energy market. The new year spat between Russia and Ukraine, had it continued, would undoubtedly have affected Ireland with rising costs and competitiveness issues.</P>
    <P>A common approach to energy is both desirable and necessary. Europe&rsquo;s energy imports are 50% of the total and rising. Energy is also becoming more expensive. Despite moves to efficiency, the price is increasing by 1% or 2% per annum. At a time when 80% of our energy use is based on oil, coal or gas, hydrocarbon reserves are decreasing. At the current rate of growth, greenhouse gases could be 5% higher in 2012 than they are today. That is alarming when we consider that our Kyoto target is an 8% reduction in these gases.</P>
    <P>Our energy infrastructure needs serious improvement. Up to &euro;1 trillion is needed over the next 20 years to meet expected energy demand. The spectre of global warming is fast reaching the level where it will be not just a question of how we live our lives but the extent to which life can be lived. This is especially the case in those areas of the world most exposed to its effects. Ironically, it is those very same countries that have contributed least to the problem of climate change.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the common approach to energy, we must be clear that different countries will have different needs. Our island status gives us energy needs and demands vastly different from other members states. Our individual requirements, such as access and so forth, must be taken into account. There is an economic and moral imperative for Ireland to develop a serious workable policy, not a token one, towards renewable energy.</P>
    <P>The green agenda has gone mainstream and Fine Gael is convinced of the national need and duty to develop modern, exciting alternatives in renewable energy sources. It is appalling that, while we are the second richest country in the world, we belch out greenhouse gases that will have risen by 130% in 2012. That is six times the EU average. This phenomenal increase could have been minimised if the Government had looked to the future and pursued policies that promote the use of biofuels. With the collapse of the Irish sugar market, the Government has not pursued with the necessary vision and resolve an energy agenda based on biofuel use. That agenda should be pursued in a strong way, ensuring that we make the most of our biofuel opportunities at home and live up to our international responsibil<Col N="38"/>ities in the European Union and beyond. Businesses are aware that, over the next ten years, 90% of gas imported will come from one gas field in the Russian Arctic, which will also supply China and the US. There is an urgency in developing a second interconnector and getting involved with a European grid to ensure security of energy supply.</P>
    <P>The European People&rsquo;s Party, of which Fine Gael is a member, met alongside the summit to discuss some emerging issues of human rights and development. Taking note of the decision adopted by the EU Foreign Affairs Ministers on 12 June, the EPP strongly condemned the constant violation of human rights in Cuba, deploring the fact that the number of political prisoners in that country is increasing since the change in EU policy towards Cuba in 2005. The EPP urged Cuba to release unconditionally all political prisoners and asked the communist regime to respect human rights and human dignity. It urged the Cuban authorities to give Internet access to dissidents prevented from having contact with the outside world. In particular, the EPP urged the Cuban Government to grant an official permit to Oswaldo Paya to allow him to visit the EU institutions, as has been repeatedly requested. The EPP believes that the <i>Damas de Blanco</i>, the Ladies in White, should be allowed to come to Europe to receive the Sakharov Prize which they were awarded in 2005.</P>
    <P>I was especially supportive of conclusions reaffirming the need for the Union to improve its responsiveness to emergencies, crises, and disasters, both within and without. A report by the former French Foreign Minister and member of the European Commission, Michel Barnier, made especially engaging reading. Entitled For a European Civil Protection Force: Europe Aid, Monsieur Barnier&rsquo;s report contains 12 workable proposals to improve Europe&rsquo;s crisis response capability. He stresses that these are personal proposals with a four-year implementation timeframe. However, in terms of the possible natural disasters, complex humanitarian crises, pandemics or conflicts Monsieur Barnier&rsquo;s report covers, there is obvious merit and potential in what he has produced.</P>
    <P>The accession of Turkey continues to be problematic. The Turkish negotiations are built on sand in the absence of a resolution on Cypriot question, as Deputy Allen and Deputy Durkan have said in the House repeatedly. Turkey, an aspirant member, persists in failing to recognise Cyprus which is a full member state of the EU. The hardening of approaches was seen clearly in Prime Minister Erdogan&rsquo;s assertion that he would rather accept a standstill in negotiations than make concessions to Cyprus. He stated that, so long as the Turkish Cypriots remain isolated, they will not open their ports and airports. He also stated that, if the EU negotiations halt, so be it. President Chirac took an equally tough tone in response. With Austrian Chancellor Sch&uuml;ssel sug<Col N="39"/>gesting that &ldquo;another option apart from full membership should be considered for Turkey&rdquo;, obviously Prime Minister Erdogan&rsquo;s uncompromising views must be seen in the context of the elections facing him in 18 months&rsquo; time and the rising Islamist element within his country.</P>
    <P>With just a year to go to a general election in this country, I urge the Taoiseach to make every effort possible to address the deeper European issues of communication, persuasion, belonging and public engagement. Unless we tackle the deficiencies in the functioning of the Union, we risk institutional paralysis, but unless we tackle the public perception of Europe as remote and distant, we risk further alienation from the people our Union is supposed to serve. Only by tackling those issues will we be able to create a Europe of real opportunity where all our people can realise and share the huge potential of our Continent.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a matter I raised with the Taoiseach previously. All other European leaders have given representation to the various parties in respect of the EU Committee of the Regions. The purpose of the institution is to bring together elected representatives of local and regional authorities from all 25 member states. Following the previous local elections in this country, there was a commitment to maintain political and geographical equilibrium in the selection of members, but unfortunately the Taoiseach appointed &mdash; although fortunately for him &mdash; five Fianna F&aacute;il full members and a further five Fianna F&aacute;il alternative members to that committee, which amounts to a denial of the democratic results of the 2004 elections. I have written to the Taoiseach on this matter and he might revert to what every other leader is doing and ensure there is equilibrium of representation in respect of the EU Committee of the Regions in so far as the people gave their verdict in the local elections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s contribution to this debate confirms reports we have heard that this was as lacklustre a summit as has taken place in recent times. The European Union summit was strong on problems but weak on solutions. The period of reflection over the past 12 months has become an extended period and a new two-year period of analysis. The Heads of State decided essentially to tread water and there seemed to be little sign of direction or leadership. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was reported in the newspapers as saying he would have preferred to have been somewhere else entirely. Perhaps that comment sums it up best.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago the Heads of State in the European Union at the previous summit called for a period of reflection during which a broad debate would take place in all member states <Col N="40"/>involving citizens, civil society, social partners, national parliaments, political parties and the European Union institutions. Recently, the European Commission published A Citizen&rsquo;s Agenda for Europe, which was a welcome contribution to the debate.</P>
    <P>Ireland had begun its own reflection process when the initial rejection of the Nice treaty in 2002 sent shockwaves through the political establishment, and a positive initiative was established in terms of the National Forum on Europe, which is still very effective. That the entire political establishment, the church, the three major political parties, the farming community, the trade union movement and the business community had all supported the referendum demonstrated that the establishment was out of sync with the electorate on the issues of European Union enlargement and European Union institutions. The subsequent defeat of referenda on the constitutional treaty in France and in the Netherlands caused alarm bells to ring throughout the EU and clearly demonstrated that significant deficits in democracy, citizen confidence and information had to be addressed before some citizens of member states would give their stamp of approval to new developments and treaties.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting on 15 and 16 June reflected the experience of those member states who urged caution and the <i>festina lente </i>maxim, especially among the older and larger member states. On the other side of the equation and at the same time, the new ten accession countries were impatient at the failure of all member states to open their borders and their job markets to the newcomers. The refusal to allow Lithuania to join the eurozone because it failed to make the grade under the strict Commission criteria for joining the eurozone caused a mini-rebellion among five of the new member states. Eight of the ten accession countries are eastern European and perceive some of the old European Union states as treating them like second class states.</P>
    <P>Therein lies the conundrum. Countries surrounding the European Union, especially the crescent to the east, see the European Union as a form of salvation with hope, democracy and employment opportunities for their burgeoning populations as well as an escape from the ravages and inhumanity experienced of dictatorship. Those states which fashioned the European Union as a vehicle to bind the former warring western European nations into a peaceful society and a prosperous market following the Second World War and the destruction it caused now perceive in many cases the eastern European countries as a potential threat to that settled, collective sense of security in western and central European society that they have forged and particularly to their jobs market. That is the conundrum and what caused the malaise at the summit.</P>
    <P>The European Union is unable to move forward definitely either on enlargement or on the <Col N="41"/>constitution because of its failure to prepare the ground and inform its citizens. The danger in such a scenario is that the European project could stagnate and shrivel. A long period of reflection and analysis is envisaged and, while there is nothing wrong with that, it is envisaged it will last for a period of three years from June 2005 until at least June 2008. This may cause difficulty in kick-starting the institutional reform process and the enlargement process in future. The danger is that malaise and stagnation could set in and the difficulty in moving forward in future could become much greater. Reflection and analysis as concepts in their own right are all well and good, but if they are not combined with action, a serious problem will emerge.</P>
    <P>The accession of the two new member states, Romania and Bulgaria, will inevitably take place in 2007 or 2008. However, there are serious concerns whether they will be allowed access to the job markets of old member states such as France and Germany which still maintain restrictions on the ten countries which joined in 2004, more than two years ago. The courage of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden in going against the tide on that occasion and opening up their job markets and economies has been rewarded, ironically, by their economies being strengthened much more than the economies of those which imposed restrictions, and those three member states are now being further rewarded by other states following their lead.</P>
    <P>However, it is difficult to see how a small country with a population of 4 million such as Ireland, which has amazingly succeeded in absorbing large numbers of Poles, Latvians, Lithuanians, Estonians and other nationalities, can absorb a further influx of Romanians and Bulgarians unless the major countries of the European Union absorb their share by lifting their restrictions. There is an onus on us, because we are proactive in these matters, to raise this issue with other Heads of States.</P>
    <P>I would have liked this issue to have been raised at the summit. However, in any of the reports of the summit I read, the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not appear to raise the issue of disparity in this regard whereby there is a free market in services and goods but not a free market in labour among certain member states and that the brunt of the burden has come to bear in many cases on small countries such as Ireland. There are benefits in this respect but there are downsides and, if Europe is to operate effectively, efficiently and within the ambit of its principles, everybody should be involved in this respect and should bear the burden.</P>
    <P>It is critical that the periods of reflection and analysis are properly structured and used by the member states and European Union Commission. Likewise, it is essential the process of enlargement proceeds in the six fledgling states that have been created from the break up of the old Yugoslavia. Of these, only Slovenia is part of <Col N="42"/>the EU and it is making marvellous progress. It will join the eurozone in 2007 and host the EU Presidency in 2008. The remaining former Yugoslav and western Balkan countries &mdash; Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania &mdash; complete the cohort of former cold war countries. The process of enlargement to admit these countries should not be delayed during the period of reflection and analysis. This matter was barely touched on at the summit although it could have been addressed by it.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is also critical that we use the next couple of years of reflection and analysis to go far beyond these concepts. The benefits of the European Union must be strongly presented and plainly visible to all citizens. The negative aspects have been allowed to grow and fester unchallenged and unchecked in many cases. For example, the democratic deficit, the loss of sovereignty, the race to the bottom in terms of wages and employment, heavy-handed bureaucracy and the lack of information have all eroded public confidence in the Union and its institutions. These negatives must be addressed in individual member states and within the Union by a leavening process within the EU institutions and structures. Citizens must instinctively feel the European Union is on their side, which is not the case. The existing and potential benefits of EU membership must be explained and unlocked.</P>
    <P>The full implementation of the Lisbon Agenda must be a priority so the social, environmental and economic strategies are brought to fruition. Fresh job opportunities, sustainable development, energy and communications policies can, on an EU-wide basis, bring enormous and tangible benefits to people&rsquo;s quality of life and their cost of living.</P>
    <P>Much lip service has been paid to the war on crime and to tackling trafficking in drugs and human beings. However, little progress has been made by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, which meets regularly and discusses these issues <i>ad nauseam</i>, by the raft of legislation and regulations introduced in the area, or by the activities of Europol and Interpol. These have just not worked. A crackdown on such damaging cross-border crimes would be enormously beneficial to the citizens of member states. Effective crime fighting and policing measures are a priority in the expanded European Union. However, there is no tangible sign the authorities are coming to grips with these issues. On the Order of Business today a question was raised regarding legislation on trafficking of human beings, which we have not yet put in place to bring Ireland into line with its European counterparts. That should be a priority for the Minister, but the Taoiseach did not appear to have any date for the heads of the Bill.</P>
    <P>At the European Union Council of 15 and 16 June it was clear there was no sense of leadership <Col N="43"/>or direction among the Heads of State. As they could not decide what to do next, they decided to do nothing other than officially extend the period of reflection into a period of analysis. The one-year period of reflection announced at the previous summit in 2005 was extended to a two-year period of analysis until June 2008. The meeting was something of a damp squib. The draft summit communiqu&eacute; urging Germany, which holds the Presidency in the first half of 2007, to present a report to the European Council in June 2007 detailing a way forward is not reassuring.</P>
    <P>What mechanism is in place to monitor the input of member states or the EU institutions in the reflection and analysis process? What ongoing mechanism will ensure something meaningful happens? Most of the member states do not seem to know where they are going or what they are doing. What structures are in place to ensure all the member states put their shoulders to the wheel, or even know how to go about that? What leadership exists to plot a course of action for member states and lead them in making the European Union relevant to the lives of their citizens? None of these questions appear to have been addressed. All we got was much wishful thinking, a promise to look at the situation in December, have a report detailing the way forward the following June 2007 and the hope to make some progress and complete the analysis by 2008. What are we going to do at that point?</P>
    <P>Perhaps there will be some progress made for the meeting in December 2006. Ireland has been a major beneficiary in most areas from its EU experience. We have taken a strong line in many areas and are pretty much a neutral and well respected country with EU borders. We have much to offer and I would like to have seen this offered at the European Council meeting last week. In the run-up to the next summit perhaps we should offer something positive and some ideas as to the way forward. We do not want to find ourselves treading water another time and ending up with another extended period of reflection and analysis that will result in stagnation in the key areas of enlargement, structural reform and making the European Union more relevant to the lives of our citizens and those of the other member states.</P>

	<P>There have only been five enlargements in the history of the European Union, the most recent in May 2004 with the accession of ten new member states. The dynamic that has driven the Union since the collapse of the Berlin Wall appears to be weakening. The decision taken on 16 May 2006 to delay final <Col N="44"/>judgment on both Bulgaria&rsquo;s and Romania&rsquo;s readiness to join in 2007 is another sign that enthusiasm is waning for adding new member states to the existing 25.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in this. Everybody wanted in, but many were loath to take in new members. We observed this when Spain and Portugal requested admission and there was concern about what this would do to the Union. However, in fairness the EU Commission cannot be accused of inventing reasons to slow the momentum of Bulgaria&rsquo;s and Romania&rsquo;s accession. It is an open secret that both countries fall considerably short of the standards expected of EU member states in the areas of justice, policing and corruption, which are the central planks of democracy. These issues must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Commission is correct not to shut its eyes to serious problems with regard to the governance of both countries in order to facilitate their early accession. Lower standards in justice, human rights and the rule of law are inclined to be infectious and would not leave existing EU states untouched. We cannot turn a blind eye to this. The European Union has shown a rock solid commitment to the accession of both countries, so much so that the delay in their accession is not likely to exceed the 12 months maximum. Reform in the areas I mentioned will have to continue long after both countries join. It is an open secret that much of the corruption extends to the politicians. Many people believe considerable money is at stake and they would claim to have large political influence with some of the groups in these countries.</P>
    <P>A more serious malaise is beginning to affect the entire EU enlargement project, which is enlargement fatigue. This enlargement fatigue is the product of many different problems, some real and others widely perceived but unfounded among the EU. Anxieties about immigration linked to the previous enlargement have soured the debate on the EU constitution, helping to defeat its ratification in the French and Dutch referenda in May and June 2005. Migration has been a positive development for the economies of most host countries. However, this migration has created problems in the countries of origin leading to skills shortages required to maintain the enlargement economic boom in those countries. I saw a television programme about people emigrating to get experience in the hope of subsequently returning. In many cases those people may wish to remain in the countries to which they have migrated. No doubt we will see the eventual accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 and that of Croatia by approximately 2010. This will be followed by a transitional period of several years before they can play a full part in the EU labour market.</P>
    <P>I welcome the re-launching of the Lisbon strategy, with its emphasis on knowledge and innovation, which we recently addressed. We have committed a considerable amount to <Col N="45"/>research and development, which is where we must invest if our economy is to progress. It also addresses the issue of integrated EU energy supply, an issue the EU as a whole and Ireland must now tackle.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the summit was to try to deal with the impasse that continues in the European Union following the rejection by the Dutch and French of the European constitution. It seems that we will muddle along on the basis of this summit. I have not seen any concrete proposals emerging simply because countries have different points of view. The British believe the constitution is dead and do not want to know about it. They were never enthusiastic about it anyway. The French do not want to say too much because their people have rejected it and domestically it would not look good to suggest holding another referendum, as it would not be acceptable to the French people. The Dutch are in a similar situation which leaves the Germans under Angela Merkel, who want to resuscitate the constitution and who are its main drivers.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we have all this talk about the European citizen. Not only is the European citizen being ignored, but those of us who have been elected are also being ignored. Many of the items contained in the European constitution such as the arms agency and the extension of the Petersberg Tasks are being introduced in any case without any debate in this Parliament or elsewhere in the European Union &mdash; so much for democracy and the citizen.</P>
    <P>The Laeken declaration suggested bringing Europe closer to the people and we now have the new idea of a citizen&rsquo;s agenda for Europe. If we are serious about empowering the people, words are all very fine, but they need to be matched by some sort of action. I agree with the proposal of Chancellor Wolfgang Sch&uuml;ssel to hold a pan-European referendum at the end of the process. I made such a proposal to the convention. However, before we can proceed with such a referendum, we need a new convention. I have made this suggestion and many NGOs throughout Europe have made a similar suggestion, which is constructive. I have not heard any better suggestion coming from the European leaders. We need a new European convention to sit for a defined period of perhaps three months, have real terms of reference and be required to come back with a result. The result would probably entail leaving out Part 3 of the constitution, which has caused considerable annoyance and is very difficult for many citizens to come to grips with.</P>
    <P>However, this suggestion is not being taken up, particularly by the Government, which wants to proceed. However, how are we to proceed? Are we just to pretend that the Dutch and French have not rejected it? Are we to hand it back to them? Are we to try to get it through by parliamentary means and not have another referendum? That will not do, as it would show con<Col N="46"/>tempt for the democratic process. I suggest trying to enhance the democratic process. There are many ways in which such a referendum could work. It could be required to have dual majority and clearly the countries that might reject it in those circumstances would need to reconsider how they want to approach the European project. It is a sensible suggestion and I ask the Minister of State to respond to it today.</P>
    <P>Clearly in some incidences, such as dealing with energy and climate change, we need greater integration within Europe. Yesterday, Dr. Eddie O&rsquo;Connor addressed a European Parliament committee about the need for an integrated approach. However, the problem is that individual member states will claim they want to maintain their independence in the sector. This simply will not work particularly when we are trying to deal with the problem of climate change and global warming. We need more integrated action in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have tried to get my hands on the Presidency report on the European security and defence policy, but have been unable to find it. Given that we will hold a debate next week on EU battle groups, I would like the Minister of State to comment on the fact that the UK&rsquo;s biggest helicopter and marine commando carrier, <i>HMS Ocean</i>, will be docked in Dublin Port later this month.</P>

The Minister of State has spoken about the citizen. I wonder how many Irish citizens know about the arrival of this British warship in our waters. While the Minister of State talks about empowering the citizen and giving information, the citizen is not part of the equation.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; an deis againn ar&iacute;s roinnt focal a r&aacute; maidir le cruinni&uacute; mullaigh na Comhairle Eorpa&iacute;. Is trua, &aacute;fach, go bhfuil muid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis i ndiaidh na comhairle, ag f&eacute;achaint ar na tortha&iacute; seachas aon ionchur a bheith againn sa Teach seo maidir le cl&aacute;r oibre an chruinnithe sin. The period of reflection has come to an end or has it? The new &ldquo;two-track&rdquo; approach seems as cosmetic and useless in terms of identifying and responding to the wishes of ordinary people as the period of reflection was. The European elite did not learn much from that period. They still fail to accept that the EU constitution and its neo-liberal substance have been expressly rejected. There was much talk during the period of the importance of communicating to citizens what the EU was doing. However, there was little or no sign of the radical reforms needed to bring <Col N="47"/>the EU in line with the views of citizens in that period.</P>
    <P>Although the future of the constitution is unclear, I will reiterate Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position. We are opposed to any attempt to re-table the Constitution or its neo-liberal contents. We will also continue to highlight and oppose the introduction of elements of the failed constitution by stealth via the Hague programme, as has happened regularly in the House in the past year.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I also regret, although I am not surprised, that little progress has been made on transparency in the work of the Council. This is a testament to the democratic deficit at the heart of the European Union. Key decisions will still be made behind closed doors and without accountability.</P>
    <P>I will address the Council conclusions on Israel. The European Council Presidency conclusions state &ldquo;the European Union remains committed to working with the Quartet towards the goal of a just, viable and lasting solution&rdquo;. It has yet to demonstrate this commitment through action. Thus far, all the EU has demonstrated is a commitment to the continuation of Israeli policies of occupation, extra-judicial killings and collective punishment. It walks this walk while paying lip service to the just demands of the Palestinian people that their right to be free from illegal occupation and the endemic human rights abuse it involves be protected. Actions speak louder than words and the Council&rsquo;s condemnation of Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians is not accompanied by the suspension of preferential trade with Israel on human rights grounds. The conclusion has no teeth.</P>
    <P>More often than not, when I put important questions to the Minister on the Government&rsquo;s foreign policy he abdicates his responsibility for this State&rsquo;s international relations to Brussels. He argues that while he would support the Palestinians, such decisions are made by the whole Council and his hands are, therefore, tied. This position is not good enough. When the Government has been given the opportunity to demonstrate its support for the realisation of a Palestinian state in the Council, for example, when the decision was taken to withdraw aid to the Palestinian Authority at a previous Council meeting, its cowardice becomes clear to all. Irish people are behind the Palestinians. It is, therefore, incumbent on the Minister to represent their voices at the European foreign policy making table and he should vote accordingly.</P>
    <P>On 9 June, Israeli forces launched an attack on a beach killing seven Palestinians, including three children. On 13 June, an Israeli missile strike on Gaza city killed nine Palestinians, including two children. Yesterday, an Israeli air strike in the Gaza Strip killed a further three children aged 16, seven and five years, respectively. These attacks are unjustifiable and amount to the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. They are <Col N="48"/>war crimes. There is an urgent need for the Government to break with the prevailing positions in the European Union, revise its policy of relations with Israel, specifically by ending its policy of preferential trade with Israel, and begin persuading its European counterparts to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Is trua nach ndearna an comhairle seo cinneadh nach bhfuil dh&aacute; ghr&aacute;d ann, le rial amh&aacute;in don dream amh&aacute;in agus rial eile don dream eile, go h&aacute;irithe maidir leis an mhargadh fosta&iacute;ochta.

   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>That concludes statements on the European Council. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy, will now take questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State to clarify a number of issues raised by speakers. On the adoption of the European constitution, does he agree it would be beneficial if Ireland, which has been particularly supportive of the European project and the integration, enlargement and advancement of Europe, were to take a lead in determining how the European Union should proceed towards the adoption of the constitution, including whether the text should be revised, having particular regard to the fact that two countries have already rejected the proposed constitution? To re-establish confidence in the European project, would it not be a good idea to assuage the fears of those who rejected the document, regardless of their reasons for doing so?</P>
    <P>On the question of enlargement of the European Union to the Balkan states, to what extent does the EU take seriously the need to address the various issues of conflict which have affected the Balkans region for a long time and determine the best possible route to proceed towards alleviating fears, abating prejudices and addressing problems?</P>
    <P>On telecommunications and crime, an issue raised by other speakers, does the European Union believe co-operation between various police forces in Europe to tackle the problem of drugs and human trafficking is sufficient? Will the Minister of State comment on the fact that Ireland is the only EU member state in which the trafficking of human beings is not a crime? I am aware that legislation is proposed in this regard. Will the Minister of State indicate how we will proceed on this matter and if legislation will be expedited?</P><Col N="49"/>
    <P>The issue of telecommunications was discussed at the Council in the context of roaming charges with Ministers reaffirming a proposal to abolish them. The Commission in particular has discussed the fundamental question of how to deal with the use of the Internet, text messages and other electronic means of communications for abusive, predatory, harassment and trafficking purposes and the need to address technical matters in parallel with policing issues. To what extent will it be possible to address technical issues, as distinct from policing issues, to deter those who have access to various means of electronic communications, such as the Internet, from intimidating others and carrying out illegal activities?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland continues to take a lead role on the proposed constitution. We have taken the consistent position at every forum and meeting, including the General Affairs and other Council meetings and COREPER, that we are totally committed to the constitution as it stands, the manner in which it was negotiated, the conclusions arrived at and the procedures in place for its ratification. It is important to recognise that 15 member states have ratified the proposed constitution, with a 16th, Finland, on the verge of ratification. We must reach the magic figure of 20 as this would allow matters to proceed.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Gormley has rejoined proceedings. He was part of the convention process which agreed the mechanism under which ratification of the proposed constitution by four fifths of EU member states would prompt a process whereby the European Council would reflect on how final agreement on ratification would be reached.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to work assiduously at domestic level and across Europe to ensure we can collectively establish the constitution as the new structure required to sustain the European Union and the European project. We regard it as the only efficient mechanism to achieve a consensual structure within which all member states are equal, opportunities are greatest and efficiency is maximised. I was privileged to attend last week&rsquo;s European Council meeting, at which it became clear that not one Government leader, Minister for Foreign Affairs or European Affairs or high level national representative opposes ratification of the constitution. Everybody took a positive attitude in achieving an ultimate conclusion. There is no sense in the best political brains in the European Union working together to reach an agreement on a constitution if we change track two thirds of the way through the process. Obviously, account must be taken of France and the Netherlands, but I am confident that when we reach the magic figure of four fifths, we will be able to find a way to ratify the document so that it becomes the basis for Europe&rsquo;s future.</P>
    <P>The European Council issued a declaration on the western Balkans which reiterated the EU&rsquo;s <Col N="50"/>pledge to continue its engagement with the countries of the region through the stabilisation and association process. Ireland supports the European aspirations of the countries of the region, including eventual EU membership, and is committed to the European neighbourhood policy and the stabilisation and association process. The EU plays a critical role in global affairs by contributing to democracy and economic sustainability, providing opportunities for adjoining countries and supporting human rights. The EU stands as a beacon to the world in terms of the democratic leadership and the monetary and human resources it has given to the countries along its borders to assist them in reaching high democratic and economic standards. We can be proud to have contributed to those efforts.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the absorption capacity and leadership of the EU, I am confident that each member state can commit further resources to maintaining economic growth and can create opportunities for the EU to evolve and expand in the future. These are big decisions which must be made in a measured and careful manner but I am confident that the entire Balkans region will benefit from this process.</P>
    <P>A specific action plan to deal with human trafficking was approved by the European Council in December 2005. The action plan covers a wide range of areas, including the co-ordination of EU action, prevention of trafficking and the investigation and prosecution of offences linked to trafficking. Implementation of the action plan has been actively pursued within the Justice and Home Affairs Council and a set of conclusions were adopted at its meeting of 27-28 April which will contribute to the development and strengthening of the plan. The Council confirmed that Europol, Eurojust and the police chiefs task force must become actively involved in the fight against human trafficking.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s question on communications mechanisms, it is critically important in this era of instant communication that controls are put in place. There is an onus on all of us in this respect because there have been instances in which people have sent false messages by text to media organisations to distort reality or frighten people. Technology is advancing so rapidly and impacting so greatly that it presents us with significant challenges. However, I am confident that the EU will be able to set the parameters on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The conclusions of the EU Presidency and the report of the summit of 15-16 June suggest a lack of leadership and direction. A sense of confusion seems to exist, as well as an inability to make meaningful decisions. This decision-making failure was revealed by the two year extension to the period of reflection, now called a period of analysis.</P>
    <P>No audit mechanism has been developed to require members to deliver on the commitments <Col N="51"/>they gave to make the EU more meaningful to its citizens. The first 12 months of reflection was not audited to determine what each member state had done to make its citizens more aware of the benefits of Europe and whether the institutions had become less bureaucratic and more democratic and responsive. The only decision made was a tentative one to hold the next summit in public so that we could observe the deliberations of Heads of State. That does not represent much progress. Unless audit mechanisms are established and directions given, member states will continue to go around in circles while achieving nothing.</P>
    <P>At least we established the Forum for Europe, at which some good proposals were brought with regard to informing Irish citizens through Europe Day, and gave citizens the opportunity to put questions to this House by means of the Internet. What are other member states doing? When the next meeting is held in 12 months&rsquo; time, it will not be possible to learn what member states have done because nobody is responsible for requesting that information. We have allowed a dangerous state of affairs to develop by extending the period of reflection from one to three years without putting structures in place. How can we address that problem? Can the Government make any suggestions with regard to establishing an implementation policy before the next summit in December?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that 15 member states have signed the constitution and that Ireland continues to lend its full support to the process. If the Government is so gung-ho in its support of the constitution, why was it roundly criticised by other Heads of State for failing to hold a referendum?</P>
    <P>My final question pertains to cross-border crime, drug smuggling and human trafficking. The existing regulations and the operations of Europol and Interpol, and the meetings of the Council of Ministers are not working. We need a new initiative. As an island nation we are particularly susceptible to drugs, smuggling, trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation from other countries. We should take the initiative on this.</P>
    <P>The Palestinian question poses a further conundrum. The Heads of State decided to bypass a democratically elected Government led by Hamas. How can the unconditional support of the United States for Israel be squared with the EU decision that its aid of &euro;100 million should bypass the democratically elected Government? Democracy must be at the heart of any national structure. What input did Ireland have on the decision?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the Minister&rsquo;s enthusiasm to continue the ratification process, will there be a referendum on this question? The Minister of <Col N="52"/>State can contribute to reaching the magic figure of 20 by doing so.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of Britain docking one of its warships in Dublin. It is the biggest helicopter and marine commander carrier, called the <i>HMS Ocean</i>, and it will dock in Dublin later this month. It will promote British beer, of all things. Does the Minister of State agree that this alienates the Irish citizen from the European project?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt about the future of the leadership of the EU. The European Council decided on a two-track approach of reflection and action. The way forward is not yet clear but matters will become clear by the middle of next year. Last week the European Council gave a mandate for extensive consultation before a report to next June&rsquo;s summit. There is commitment to reach necessary decisions on the process by 2008. The focus will be on concrete issues and challenges. The Council identified key areas, including fighting crime and terrorism, facing challenges of energy and climate change and promoting economic growth and job creation. These are critically important for Ireland and the EU. Ireland remains committed to the ratification of the EU constitution. Following the decision of the European Council in June to initiate a period of reflection it was decided that no date for the referendum would be set until matters became clearer.</P>

	<P>In a democracy a period of reflection is advantageous to parliamentarians, who can promote the constitution, and citizens, who can receive more information through the National Forum on Europe. It is important that we embrace this together. There is no point in holding a referendum if conditions are not right for a positive outcome. The past 12 months have not been spent on analysis. The financial perspectives were agreed last December, allocating resources for the next seven years. This provides sustainability, stability and clarity for the future. The EU continues to function effectively and is focused on delivery to its citizens. The controversial services directive has been agreed. It is a credit to Commissioner McCreevy that he could make the necessary changes.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU wants the new Government led by Hamas to make a <i>de facto</i> statement that it condemned violence and would not use it for political means. The EU has decided that <Col N="53"/>funding of &euro;224 million is available to support the Palestinian people. Through High Representative Javier Solana, the Presidency, the Troika and senior officials of the Commission, including President Barroso, every effort has been made to channel cash to the people for education, welfare and health services. The EU has made every effort to ensure this happens. We want democracy to prevail.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DanWallace"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>It has often been said that the Celtic tiger and the expanding economy of Ireland have impacted on our lives. This is particularly true of roads and transport. We now live in a more affluent society, as evidenced by the volume and type of traffic on our roads. The <Col N="54"/>Government has a responsibility to react to the changing circumstances and legislate for this aspect of life in modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in roads and the increase in the number of private cars on roads is welcome, but it also brings responsibilities that many drivers do not accept. Major roadworks can be seen in every county. The Watergrasshill, Ballincollig, Midleton, Youghal and Carrigtwohill bypasses have been completed. The Fermoy bypass and the Mitchelstown ring road will open shortly. These are positive developments in infrastructure to ensure our road network is of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill, the sixth major legislative initiative taken by the Government in the past six years. All Bills have had the underlying theme of protecting road users and making transport safer. In 2001, there were 1.6 million vehicles on the roads and 411 road deaths. In 2005, there were 2.1 million vehicles on our roads and 399 road deaths, an increase on the figures for 2004. Any road death is one too many. The major increase in cars on the roads means it is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility to reduce road deaths. Thousands of people are injured, some seriously, because of the conduct of drivers.</P>
    <P>If we continue to improve road safety and reduce deaths on our roads, we must target the following key areas. We must encourage responsibility among road users through an effective, co-ordinated education plan.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
     <Quest>the dates on which he expects each of the agencies under his auspices listed for decentralisation to complete the process; the extent to which existing specialist staff will be lost in the move; the impact on the capacity to deliver quality service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24057/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Four of the agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise as follows: F&Aacute;S is to move 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly; Enterprise Ireland is to move 292 posts to Shannon; the Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, County Kilkenny, and the National Standards Authority of Ireland is to move 132 posts to Arklow, County Wicklow.</P><Col N="55"/>
    <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, F&Aacute;S is due to transfer its head office including 383 staff to Birr, County Offaly with a target date of 2009. There is no sub-category for specialist posts. The F&Aacute;S plan is predicated on the maintenance of services while the decentralisation programme is being implemented. F&Aacute;S is confident that the process can be managed in such a manner that specialist services provided by the organisation will be unaffected.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, County Kilkenny. The authority has been advised by OPW that as the site procurement is in the final stages, the current time line for availability for occupancy is late 2008. Twenty-one new recruits, along with four serving staff who wish to move in advance of the Thomastown premises being available, will shortly move to interim accommodation in Kilkenny city.</P>
    <P>It is assumed the specialist staff referred to hold inspector positions. It is not possible for the authority to predict what decisions individual staff members may take in respect of their career choices. Therefore, it is impossible to predict what specialist staff will be lost to the authority during the decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>All specialist posts based in the Dublin headquarters of the Health and Safety Authority are earmarked for decentralisation, but as part of the decentralisation plan, the need to maintain an office in Dublin to service the Dublin region would require 34 specialists.</P>
    <P>Currently the authority has approximately 100 inspectors of which in excess of 60% are based in Dublin. Of these, seven have applied through CAF to relocate. In addition, a number of specialist posts have also been filled on promotion on the basis of the final location of the post being Thomastown. Nine new inspectors have been recruited on the basis that their eventual location will be Thomastown.</P>
    <P>The figures outlined exclude REACH staff. All staff, both specialist and administrative which includes up to 44, sanctioned for REACH will be based in Thomastown.</P>
    <P>I understand the authority has identified loss of specialist staff as a real risk and has proposals in its decentralisation plan to deal with that risk. The authority has a comprehensive programme of work approved by the board of the authority and presented to my Department in accordance with the provision of the Safety, Health and Welfare Act 2005. The authority is fully committed to delivering on its programme of work in 2006 and subsequent years while moving forward with its decentralisation implementation plan as published on the website and updated from time to time.</P>
    <P>The NSAI projects April 2009 as the completion date under its current decentralisation plan, for the move of 132 posts to Arklow. NSAI has 74 posts of specialist skills planned for relo<Col N="56"/>cation under the decentralisation move to Arklow. Currently, eight holders of these specialist posts have expressed their willingness to transfer with their post to Arklow. The decentralisation plan developed by the authority addresses the delivery of quality service and recognises the requirement to manage this issue.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland, including 292 posts, will relocate to Shannon as part of the decentralisation programme. Of these posts, some 107 are in the technical and professional grades, while 25 are senior managers working in general administrative grades with specialist skills and experience, giving a total of 132 specialist posts in all.</P>
    <P>The most recent information from the CAF indicates that 19 Enterprise Ireland staff applied for decentralisation to Enterprise Ireland in Shannon. Of these, seven are in technical and professional grades, based in Dublin, and in posts that have been identified for relocation to Shannon; and four are in technical and professional grades and are based outside Dublin or in posts that have not been designated for relocation to Shannon.</P>
    <P>The timing of the major move of Enterprise Ireland staff to Shannon town is dependent on having sufficient, suitably qualified and experienced people opting to transfer to Shannon, within the terms of the Government decision, to undertake the work of the areas scheduled for location in Shannon. It is too early at this stage to predict with certainty when a sufficient cadre of suitably qualified and experienced staff will be in place. Therefore, while a preferred site has been identified in Shannon, in consultation with the OPW, it is not possible to say when the move to Shannon will be completed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister believe Enterprise Ireland can continue to deliver its services if less than 5% of its staffing is willing to move to the new location? The same proportion applies across all the agencies &mdash; less than 5% willing to move with their services. Is the Minister stating that these boards guarantee that they can continue to deliver services in the new locations despite losing up to 95% of their staff, with the result that he must fill vacancies or achieve new recruits for those vast gaps that are opening up?</P>
    <P>Is he satisfied that there will not be losses of critical skills? In reply to a parliamentary question of mine, he indicated that of nearly 300 key specialist skills staff in these agencies, less than 25 are willing to move. I ask the Minister to explain to the House how these agencies can continue to deliver services if there is such a degree of meltdown in their critical areas of expertise. In his reply, the Minister did not mention how he thought they could deliver a quality service without these critical staff and that is a critical issue.</P>
    <P Just="Left">As the Minister responsible, what offer will he make to the members of staff who opt to remain <Col N="57"/>in Dublin, as is their right? What is he saying to the staff in Enterprise Ireland, in the Health and Safety Authority, in the national standards authority or in F&Aacute;S? What options do they have if they opt to stay in Dublin but their body, their employer with whom they have a contract, moves out?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied the agencies will manage this process in such a way as not to undermine or jeopardise their core activities or performance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>What evidence does the Minister have of that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt Deputy Bruton and I would appreciate being allowed the opportunity to reply.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s results, published yesterday, are a clear manifestation that the decentralisation process is not undermining its performance or capacity to achieve and to work. Subsequent to previous decentralisation of major agencies such as the Central Statistics Office, there was no evidence that the activities, services or standards of agencies or of Departments or units of Departments transferred were undermined.</P>
    <P>It really depends on one&rsquo;s political viewpoint and one&rsquo;s commitment to the concept of decentralisation. There are challenges and as I stated publicly already, we have to approach the area of agencies differently than we approached the area of the Civil Service. My Department, for example, which is transferring to Carlow, has made rapid progress on that decentralisation project and is well in line to achieve its target. Clearly, the same experience has not been evident in agencies. Nonetheless, the Health and Safety Authority is making good progress in terms of the Thomastown site and being in a position to move on an interim basis to Kilkenny city.</P>
    <P>We will continue to work through the centralised arrangements in consultation with the social partners to advance the agenda, but without undermining the activities of the agencies concerned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that it is not sufficient to state that because the CSO move worked, this will work in all these specialist agencies? What evidence has he given that it will work? Can he give me the business case he put together stating why Enterprise Ireland should move as he proposes? What is the business case for the move of F&Aacute;S, the HSA and the national standards authority? Is it not the case that no business case was made by his Department for these moves? These were moves decided &mdash; as he correctly stated &mdash; on a political basis, not on the basis of any proper evaluation of the issues.</P>
    <P>Is it not incumbent on him, as Minister, to spell out this different approach which he states must be taken with our agencies? He is responsible for <Col N="58"/>these agencies. He is responsible for the delivery of their services. He should tell us the different approach he is now taking so that they can build their plans on some certainty of what the political approach will be. I have not heard of a single offer to the staff in Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S, HSA or NSAI as to what they will get if they opt to remain in Dublin and, as the Minister will be aware, up to 90% of them are making that decision. The Minister must tell us this new approach. Just because he states this is a sort of political stroke, he should not expect that we go away and state we do not hold him accountable for delivering quality services from these new locations. We want to see the evidence and the strategy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>At no stage have I stated this is a political stroke and Deputy Bruton is clearly distorting what I stated in that regard. I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s honesty in saying he is basically against decentralisation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that.</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a political stroke. The Minister is completely misrepresenting what Deputy Bruton said.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is a fact. Members are taking a two-sided approach to decentralisation. Many Dublin-based Members and Opposition spokespersons articulate a negative attitude to decentralisation to please their constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the Minister answer the questions? What is the business case? What is his strategy? He should not lecture the Opposition on what he thinks we might think.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
     <Quest>the action he intends to take regarding the black economy; the actions which have been taken by his Department or by agencies under his control to date in 2006 to crack down on companies, organisations or persons operating in the black market; the reassurances he can give to consumers at risk of exploitation and legitimate businesses at risk of losing sales to unregulated competitors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23523/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The &ldquo;black economy&rdquo; is generally described as the hidden sector of the economy where private cash transactions go unreported and hence untaxed. As such, the policing of this area is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance. In the context of the new social partnership agreement, which is subject to ratification over the coming weeks, it is proposed that the hidden economy working group will be relaunched immediately upon its ratification and will meet on a monthly basis or as appropriate thereafter. The Revenue Commissioners chair this group which consists of members from ICTU, CIF, SFA, ISME and the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is also anticipated that the new office of the director for employment rights compliance, when established, will join this working group.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are continuing with their programmes to tackle the problem of the hidden economy through their routine audit and compliance activities, with a special emphasis on the construction sector in 2006. Furthermore, special compliance districts throughout the country actively pursue intelligence and inquiries surrounding all aspects of the hidden economy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the activity of bodies operating in the context of my Department&rsquo;s area of policy responsibility, the Director of Corporate Enforcement regulates the compliance of companies and their officers with company law rather than taxation. However, sections 17 and 18 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 provide for the sharing of information between the Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Corporate Enforcement and a memorandum of understanding has been agreed between the two bodies to give concrete effect to this. If, in the course of investigation of a particular company, a significant taxation issue comes to the attention of the director and his staff they apprise the Revenue Commissioners accordingly. Equally, there is provision for information flow from the Revenue Commissioners to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply, although I note his Department&rsquo;s reluctance to take this question in the first instance. On the <Col N="60"/>basis of his reply, the Department does not wish to have anything to do with attempting to bring the black economy into the white or grey economy. Does the Minister accept ISME&rsquo;s assertion that departmental agencies, including its inspectorate, should assist the Revenue Commissioners to ensure operators in the black economy competing with legitimate small firms are properly policed and investigated? This is not only about taxation but about operators breaking health and safety, company, planning and transport regulations, which means an illegal company operating outside the rules poses a serious threat to legitimate small enterprises that are trying to compete on a level playing pitch. However, they are being undercut by people who break more than taxation rules. Should the Minister&rsquo;s Department, rather than the Revenue Commissioners, take the lead in combating the black economy, which is a complete reversal of the opening sentence of his reply?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>A cross-departmental approach is needed to tackle the hidden economy as no Department in isolation can deal with it. We are anxious and committed to undermining the black economy because it affects the entire edifice on which most of our social progress is based and on which legitimate business is carried out. However, the Revenue has a significant role to play on the working group with ISME, SFA, CIF and ICTU. That group could make a co-ordinated attack on the hidden economy.</P>
    <P>Labour law compliance is important in tackling this part of the economy. We made a positive contribution to the new social partnership agreement, particularly in paragraphs 11 to 26, inclusive, which deal with labour law compliance and employment rights. There is a strong shared commitment between the social partners and Government to improved compliance with legal requirements underpinned by strong enforcement. A major package of measures has been agreed such as the establishment of a new statutory office for employment rights compliance.</P>
    <P>Significantly, similar to the ODSCA, the new office will have clear links to Revenue through the memorandum of understanding and the legal underpinning of its establishment. The office will be permitted to share information with the Revenue. Such co-ordination is needed to crack down on much of the illegal activity as people avoid taxation and various other legal requirements. The new package of measures, outlined in paragraphs 11 to 26, inclusive, of the new agreement manifests a strong commitment on my behalf and that of the Department to tackle the hidden economy effectively and in a co-ordinated manner with other relevant authorities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the new working group be chaired by the Revenue Commissioners rather than the Minister&rsquo;s Department?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="61"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>If the group is driven by the Revenue, it will miss much of the action. It is estimated the value of the black economy could be as high as &euro;15 billion a year. While it is difficult to measure, the OECD and Jim Power of Friends First say it is enormous. Does the Minister agree that many activities in the hidden economy other than tax evasion fall within the statutory remit of his Department and it should be the lead agency in driving the new group in conjunction with other Departments? For example, work permits and compliance with company law and health and safety standards are vested in his Department through statutory instruments. I do not get a sense from the Minister that his Department looks on this as even a peripheral concern, not to mind a central concern, and it considers this to be primarily a Revenue issue. More than 100,000 enterprises that employ fewer than ten people are struggling daily in a buoyant economy because illegal, pirate and cowboy operators are not complying with the law. These enterprises are forced to cut corners and reduce their compliance with legal standards, which we all support.</P>
    <P>They desperately need help and although the Minister has primary responsibility for the economy and employment, as well as company and employment law within the economy, I do not get the impression that he envisages for himself a central and primary responsibility in the minimisation &mdash; it will never be eradicated &mdash; of the operation of the black economy. Some people have suggested it has grown by 50% in the past 20 years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I must reject the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that neither I nor my Department are committed to this issue. It appears as though the Deputy had made up his mind in that regard before asking the question or hearing the reply. For example, our contribution to the social partnership talks in respect of labour law compliance has been strong. If one considers health and safety, within the past year my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, has finalised and brought into law a substantial new consolidated Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, which contains extremely significant obligations for employers regarding their responsibilities. In terms of company law, the Department is very committed to the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement, which comes under the aegis of my Department. The establishment of this office is a recent development. Hence, there is no evidence at all to suggest a reluctance on the part of my Department to deal with the issue of the hidden economy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should show some leadership in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="62"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see anything wrong with the agreement on the part of the social partners to the effect that Revenue should chair a working group on this matter. It is of key importance that everyone should be represented on the working group to ensure co-ordination. Revenue is a powerful force with regard to the hidden economy and its impact on the latter should not be underestimated or understated. As far as the new director within the Office of the Director for Corporate Enforcement with responsibility for labour law is concerned, it is of key importance that he or she has the legal capacity and obligation to relay any Revenue-related matters, which he or she might encounter in the course of specific investigations, back to Revenue. Such intersectoral and interdepartmental synergies will achieve the best results in this respect.</P>

     <asker>Dr. Cowley</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
     <Quest>if he will address the crisis in Ballina, County Mayo where the unemployment rate is twice the national average; his views on whether this situation needs to be addressed in view of the fact this town has lost 1,000 jobs in recent years; the plans which are in place to address same; the proactive steps being taken by the IDA; when the IDA will begin to sell Ballina for what it is and to entice much needed industry to the region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23989/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Unemployment is measured through the quarterly national household survey as published by the Central Statistics Office. The survey provides a breakdown of data on a regional basis only, and not on specific towns. The most recent survey data published at the end of May shows the national unemployment rate is 4.2%. The equivalent rate for the western region, which includes Ballina, is 4.3%.</P>
    <P>Live register data are available for specific areas such as Ballina. However, they are not designed to measure unemployment. In addition to showing the numbers claiming unemployment assistance and benefit, they also include part-time, seasonal and casual workers, who are entitled to unemployment benefit. In May 2005, a total of 1,437 people were on the live register in Ballina. The most recent data available are for May 2006, which show that this number has fallen to 1,308.</P>
    <P>State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies, and while I may give general policy directives to the agencies under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P><Col N="63"/>
    <P>I have been assured by the agencies under the remit of my Department that they are endeavouring to attract new investment, to encourage the start-up of new businesses, to grow existing businesses and to develop the labour market in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland actively promotes Ballina for new foreign investment and since January 2003, five first-time site visits to Ballina have taken place. In addition, IDA Ireland actively works with the existing base of overseas companies in Ballina and Mayo to encourage them to grow and expand.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is also developing world class business and technology parks at a number of towns throughout Mayo. The goal is to ensure that such locations have the appropriate property solutions, tailored to specific key sectoral targets, to attract inward investment. In Ballina, IDA Ireland has been in discussions with Mayo County Council regarding the acquisition of a site of approximately 27 acres in local authority ownership on the Sligo Road. The IDA has completed site investigation works and has obtained planning permission for site development works to ensure these lands are suitable for industrial purposes prior to acquisition. I understand the IDA awaits contract documentation and copy of unburdened title from Mayo County Council.</P>
    <P>In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, HPSU, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions. A new Enterprise Ireland supported HPSU company, Heatsolve Limited, commenced operations in Ballina in early 2005.</P>
  
  <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to transform Irish companies into market focused and innovation driven businesses and to increase their exports, sales and employment. Enterprise Ireland has approved funding support of more than &euro;6.4 million and paid more than &euro;2.9 million to companies in County Mayo in the period from 2003 to date. Of this, Enterprise Ireland client companies in the north Mayo area have been approved funding of more than &euro;1.2 million.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has worked in close co-operation with Mayo County Council in the development of the broadband metropolitan area networks in Ballina and Kiltimagh, both of which are now complete.</P>
    <P>During 2005, Mayo County Enterprise Board approved a total of &euro;437,965 to 23 projects and paid out &euro;301,239 in grant assistance, which resulted in the creation of 53 net jobs in county <Col N="64"/>enterprise board-assisted companies throughout the county. Five of the 23 projects which received a grant approval in 2005 were in the Ballina area and accounted for &euro;82,400, or 19%, of the total grant approvals in Mayo in 2005. To date, a total of &euro;28,579 has been paid out by Mayo County Enterprise Board.</P>
    <P>Mayo County Enterprise Board&rsquo;s 2006 programme budget is, at more than &euro;900,000, 12.9% greater than the 2005 allocation. This increase enables Mayo County Enterprise Board to fulfil its function and remit in maximising entrepreneurial development in the microenterprise sector throughout the county.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the policies being pursued by the agencies under the remit of my Department, together with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to regional development will continue to bear fruit in terms of the creation of sustainable development for the people of Ballina and of the west generally.</P>
 </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I have had numerous replies from the Minister in this regard as I have raised the issue consistently. As for the 27 acre park, it is disgraceful that the IDA still lacks a site, premises or business park that can be marketed, sold or exhibited to potential investors. This is a scandal and marks a Government failure. In the past nine years,<?oasys _jy ?>Ballina has lost 1,340 jobs and only 400 replacement jobs have been created, which constitutes a net loss of nearly 1,000 jobs. I can only describe this as a mortal blow.</P>
    <P>Ballina is an unemployment black spot. Although the Minister cited an unemployment rate of 4%, the rate stands at 11% in Ballina, which is twice the national average.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The numbers on the live register in Ballina exceed those for the entire County Roscommon, which speaks for itself. The fast-tracking of the industrial park on the Sligo Road must be ensured because the IDA needs a site.</P>
    <P>Moreover, while the Minister may assert that the N26 Ballina to Bohola bypass is the responsibility of the National Roads Authority, he must exercise his collective responsibility as there must be some movement in this regard.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister stated the IDA is playing its part, this is not the case and it has failed miserably. The IDA denies it is at fault and points to the absence of infrastructure in Ballina, which is abysmal. In previous replies, the Minister claimed to be confident that the national development plan would bear fruit for Ballina. However, there has been an underspend of &euro;3.8 billion, including a &euro;500 million underspend on transport. How can Ballina survive without the requisite infrastructure to make it competitive? This is the <Col N="65"/>story of the west. Can the Minister do better than this?</P>
    <P>Apparently, a couple of hundred million euro in seed capital will be made available. Will any of it be made available to Ballina companies? Will any of it reach companies from Mayo, or from the west, to allow people from Mayo to rise above their present abysmal state? The scale of failure has been abysmal. While the Minister has claimed advances are being made in respect of the business park, in reality the only advances being made are in the state of neglect of the west and of Ballina in particular. Can the Minister shed some light in this respect?</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Unemployment has been reduced in Ballina from 1,437 to 1,308 in the past year. Members should be careful in respect of the language they use.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should try to tell that to 2,000 people plus.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was in Mayo recently and to describe either conditions or indigenous business there as abysmal is ridiculous and should not be done. County Mayo has a good indigenous sector, with some excellent local companies which create good employment. While challenges certainly exist in respect of infrastructure, there is a significant number of positive factors in County Mayo, not least the number of strong indigenous companies that deserve to be supported and to have their successes articulated. The word &ldquo;abysmal&rdquo; does not rate and is inappropriate and irrelevant to the quality of many of the companies which operate there.</P>
    <P>As for venture capital funding, I anticipate that a number of new high potential start-up companies in Mayo and, hopefully, in Ballina, will emerge and will avail of the funds. The money in question is not given away. It must be earned in terms of the quality of companies, their products and new ideas. The money will follow ideas and products which have good commercial realisability, potential etc.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department has received good feedback from towns in County Mayo in terms of responding to Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s community enterprise centres. I understand ten community enterprise centres have been funded in County Mayo, which illustrates good local community attitudes to enterprise and a willingness of local communities to develop their own companies and so forth. As the Deputy is aware, the most recent case concerned IRD Kiltimagh Limited, for which &euro;300,000 has been approved for an expansion to its existing centre.</P>
    <P>I visited the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology recently to open the innovation centre on the Castlebar campus. This also constitutes a good success story which augurs well for a good relationship between that institute and local businesses.</P><Col N="66"/>
    <P>As for the IDA and the proposed site, this is one of the biggest problems in respect of foreign direct investment. The Deputy cannot blame the IDA for this, as some people do, as there is a problem with the title of the site.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely, another site could be procured.</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand IDA Ireland does not want to sell short the county council which invested significantly in that site as part of an agreement. I accept people have different ideas and members of my party articulated to me that perhaps a different site should have been selected a number of years ago. I cannot retrospectively resolve that.</P>
    <P>This is a major challenge. Ideally, securing that site would open up and pave the way for a more effective approach to attracting industry, and I must acknowledge that. However, one cannot state it is a matter for IDA Ireland alone. Locally, heads must be put together to see whether we can resolve it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister think that an 11% unemployment rate is abysmal?</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>From where did the Deputy get that figure?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is twice the national average rate and more than County Roscommon. It is abysmal. The Minister must take action on Ballina.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know from where Deputy Cowley got the figure of 11%. The live register is not the unemployment register and the unemployment rate is reducing in Ballina. I met the chamber of commerce in Ballina and people there are anxious to bring in foreign direct investment as well as developing their own. That is the issue. Regarding the site development works, the most pressing challenge is locating and securing title to the site so we can develop it and make it available to potential foreign direct investors.</P>

     <asker>Mr. P. Breen</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
     <Quest>the measures he and job creation agencies are taking to create the potential of 3,500 jobs at the Ennis Information Age Park in Ennis, County Clare; the current employment numbers at the park; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24056/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Job creation measures in the Ennis Information Age Park, IAPE, and elsewhere are a matter for the relevant industrial development <Col N="67"/>agencies and not one in which I have any direct involvement. As I indicated in response to previous similar parliamentary questions, Shannon Development&rsquo;s 30-acre information age park in Ennis, which opened on 9 June 2005, is in the early stages of a long-term development. The park is intended to provide a high potential start-up base for Ennis and County Clare which will also accommodate appropriate foreign direct investment companies brought to Ireland by IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development estimates that, when completed, the park has the potential to facilitate the creation of an estimated 3,500 high value jobs in more than 700,000 sq. ft. of high quality office accommodation. At present, the total space let to enterprises is 5,000 sq. ft. and more than 8,500 sq. ft. are available for letting in three units of large floor office space suitable for second stage incubation projects.</P>
    <P>Phase one of the project involves an investment of &euro;11 million by Shannon Development in a new InnovationWorks facility designed to fast-track the development of Irish high potential start-up enterprise. Shannon Development estimates that &euro;110 million will be invested between the public and private sectors in the new park over the next 15 years.</P>
    <P>Prior to the opening of the park, Shannon Development had 12 Irish industry client companies in the Clare Business Centre. All 12 companies transferred to the park when it opened because the Clare Business Centre was subsequently closed as part of Shannon Development&rsquo;s strategy of building a more modern business friendly incubation centre. One of the 12 companies subsequently closed. In addition to the transferred companies, three new companies formed since the park opened. The total employment in the client companies which originally transferred to the park was 17. The number of new jobs created by those 11 transferred companies and the three new companies formed since the IAPE opened is 20, bringing the total to 37. Shannon Development is confident that the early growth shown will continue to develop in the future.</P>
    <P>In addition, Shannon Development accommodates Clare County Council which will rent 20,000 sq. ft. of office space at the park until it moves to its new headquarters next year. This is a short-term arrangement and Shannon Development has held back sufficient space to accommodate potential foreign direct investment client requirements by IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development will continue to attract and help establish high potential start-ups in the park through its venture development process. This process encapsulates the various stages of business development from idea generation, feasibility study stage, project development, market launch and business expansion and offers an integrated package of business development <Col N="68"/>programmes to achieve this. IDA Ireland works closely with Shannon Development in the provision of suitable property solutions for potential investors to the county. The development of Ennis Information Age Park has become an integral part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s international marketing programme and will be pivotal in attracting new investors.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I was present last year when he officially opened the Ennis Information Age Park. Regarding the potential for 3,500 jobs, the first phase cost Shannon Development approximately &euro;11 million. Does the Minister think the creation of only 20 jobs in the first year is a very poor return for an investment of &euro;11 million?</P>
    <P>Has confusion over who is involved when it comes to enterprise activities in Clare led to a downward trend in job creation in Ennis and surrounding areas? Will the Minister assure me that, on switching Shannon Development&rsquo;s enterprise functions to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, they will be able to attract more indigenous and foreign investment industry?</P>
    <P>Approximately 4,500 people leave Ennis and its surrounding areas every day to commute to Limerick and Shannon. Ennis is becoming a dormitory town. Approximately 570 jobs were lost between 1999 and 2005. Organic Lenses and Monster Cables created approximately 100 and 50 jobs respectively. Will the Minister elaborate on the role of Enterprise Ireland in attracting industry to Ennis Information Age Park? Does he agree that IDA Ireland&rsquo;s performance in Ennis was very poor? Does the Minister believe it is value for money to spend &euro;11 million to create 20 jobs in 12 months while there is potential for 3,500 jobs?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Shannon Development is responsible for the development of Ennis Information Age Park. It always made clear that it is a 15 to 20-year development. I understand all local Deputies supported that initiative by Shannon Development and continue to do so. To be fair to Shannon Development, it almost manages within its own resources. The manner in which it developed its property portfolio generated significant revenues which enabled it to plough it back into enterprise development.</P>
    <P>The most recent successful company it supported was Stockbyte, based in the technology park in Tralee, which was floated and is a great success. I met Stockbyte representatives prior to the floatation and they articulated strong appreciation for the role of Shannon Development in the company&rsquo;s early stage support.</P>
    <P>I gave a new mandate to Shannon Development which gives it certainty and security in terms of the broad regional economic development of the region in the future. It is important that the national and international resources which Enterprise Ireland has are brought in a more <Col N="69"/>focused and effective way to many of the indigenous companies in the Shannon region. That would be a win-win situation for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Clare has a strong foreign direct investment base, contrary to the rhetoric articulated from time to time. Total State supported foreign direct investment employment now represents approximately 15% of the labour force in County Clare. That compares with 7% in the national labour force. I accept that includes the Shannon Free Zone as well as IDA Ireland backed employment. Clare has been a good magnet for foreign direct investment.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I want people to examine matters with a regional focus. If we cannot even consider matters with a county focus, our industrial policy will go nowhere fast strategically. County Clare has strong quality companies such as Roche, Olympus and Essidev which provide high quality jobs and are expanding. Deputy Pat Breen might be interested to know the employment in IDA Ireland companies had strong growth in 2005. It increased by 10%. It is not only about bringing in <Col N="70"/>new companies. It is about increasing the range and functions of existing companies to increase employment, which happened in 2005. Clare is especially strong on pharmaceuticals and medical technologies. With progress on the Ennis bypass and the environmental impact study on the Crusheen to Gort section of the N18 which was published in February, we are also acting on infrastructural issues which are important for job creation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the 3,500 potential jobs at Ennis Information Age Park, are any new jobs in the pipeline for that centre? I know Clare County Council takes up some of it. Does the Minister consider 20 jobs at a cost of &euro;11 million is good value?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Stage one involves an investment of &euro;11 million and all the infrastructural work. I would like to see more jobs but, having said that, Shannon Development has always made it clear that it is a long-term, 15-year project. We will give any support we can to Shannon Development to support companies to base themselves at the location in question, be they indigenous or foreign direct investors.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting and has perhaps confirmed my point that in response to each priority question we have been referring con<Col N="76"/>stantly to independent bodies in which the Minister has no role. In certain cases, there is confusion over which body has authority. I asked my question on the back of a report by TASC entitled Outsourcing Government: Public Bodies and Accountability. It raised real concerns about the level of outsourcing, which is sometimes appropriate, and also about the lack of accountability under this process. I noticed in particular that 90% of the budget of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was allocated to outside agencies. This contrasts with other <Col N="77"/>Departments and TASC&rsquo;s assessment clashes with that of the Minister. We can go through the details ourselves at a later stage.</P>
    <P>TASC states that of the 29 public bodies in the Minister&rsquo;s Department, only 15 are listed in the budgetary Estimates and only 14 were established by the Oireachtas. Does the Minister agree with the concerns over there being 450 such bodies involving 500 appointments by the Government? There is a lack of accountability and clarity regarding the agencies that exist, their remit and the source of their money. Does the Minister not agree that there is a need for a full review of our procedures for setting up public bodies so their appointees will not be regarded solely as cronies of members of whatever party is in power? Does he agree that financing should be utterly transparent and that there should be accountability to the Oireachtas so our democracy will not be diminished due to massive outsourcing of Government activities, which has become increasingly prevalent in the past ten years? This is what the TASC report concludes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wrong to use the term &ldquo;outsourcing&rdquo; in respect of the establishment of State agencies to carry out specific functions designated thereto by the Executive and Oireachtas. It is improper to use the term in respect of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S, for example.</P>
    <P>On the question of there being a lack of political accountability, we must be careful at all times to ensure there is strong accountability to Parliament. We could always consider mechanisms to determine how to facilitate such accountability more effectively without intervening too much in the operations and activities of the State agencies. There were far more agencies in my Department when I was Minister for Health and Children and I took the decision to amalgamate quite a number of them into one national delivery service. This was after a very considered review and analysis by consultants and various other people.</P>
    <P>The enterprise strategy group considered the future of industrial strategy. It did not recommend the amalgamation of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, for example, nor did it recommend the abolition of county enterprise boards or other such bodies. These are the fundamental questions that arise if one is proposing a fundamental review of agencies in my Department.</P>
    <P>There is a strong correlation between the success of the economy over the past ten or 15 years and the effectiveness of the bodies in question, particularly those on the economic side. Likewise, it is hard to doubt the need for a health and safety authority or the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Recent events necessitated the creation of such an office. It is also hard to doubt the need for F&Aacute;S as a national training office. When considering the existing bodies one at a time, one will not see much room for rationalisation or the elimination of some of them. The National Standards Authority has a particular role in facilitating the development of standard <Col N="78"/>documents for manufacturers, service providers etc.</P>
    <P>On the issue of accountability, the Minister for Finance recently developed new methods to deal with the accounting and financial expenditure in terms of how Estimates are laid before the D&aacute;il and the respective committees. I support these and they may afford a greater opportunity to Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to ensure the financial accountability of State bodies. The Comptroller and Auditor General has an oversight role, as does the Committee of Public Accounts. The fundamental question concerns the degree to which the Oireachtas wants to delegate responsibilities to State agencies. Much of the work of the agencies in my Department, such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, has been very successful. I am not so sure the agencies would have been so successful had they been encapsulated by the Civil Service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt but that we need agencies such as the IDA and I commend them on their good work. Does the Minister believe he needs 29 different agencies, as listed in the TASC report. I could provide this list to the Minister and we could determine what agencies included thereon are not on his list. We could then ask whether the identified agencies are needed. Does the report not beg the question as to whether the functions of certain agencies overlap and whether there is a requirement for tightening up?</P>
    <P>There is a lack of political accountability. We have a National Consumer Agency and a Consumer Strategy Group. On the issue of setting up the enterprise strategy group, we allocate functions to a to a particular appointed board or group and, when results are not achieved, the Department says it has no role in the operations of the independent body in question. There is much concern that when work done outside the aegis of the Department and without political direction does not lead to positive developments, the Department is distanced from the work that must then be done. There is a lack of democratic accountability and a need for a review and amalgamation. That there are 29 departmental agencies receiving 90% of the Department&rsquo;s budget begs the question as to whether there is a quango system in place that suits the Department but not the people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The big push currently is to get stronger synergy among the major agencies &mdash; IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S &mdash; in terms of the skills issues as they affect multinational and indigenous companies. The consumer strategy group is gone; it was in operation for a short period. We must distinguish between agencies and groups that are established for a specific research policy purpose. While the Small Business Forum will continue in an implementation role, it could hardly be described as an <Col N="79"/>agency. It is an effective facility for small businesses to inform Government of their ongoing needs. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, for example, was set up for a specific reason and has achieved outstanding success. Taking that alone, the benefits to be accrued from good governance via the establishment of such agencies are obvious. I am open to better political accountability. I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that all the agencies should realise that the funding comes from this House and that we should have good mechanisms, but we can improve our lot here also, even at committee level, in terms of the way we interact.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
     <Quest>his Department&rsquo;s view on the recent increases in the NCB purchasing managers index, which rose to 66.2% in May 2006, and the consequent pressures that are being put on small enterprises due to rising costs; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that costs for small businesses in the service sector are rising at their fastest rate since 2002; the action he intends to take to bring costs under control; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23488/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure referred to by the Deputy relates to the NCB purchasing managers services index. It indicates impressive growth in the services sector and healthy demand. The May data from this report signalled the sharpest expansion of new business placed at Irish services firms since September 2000. This report provides further evidence that expansion in the services sector continues to be an important driver of economic and employment growth. Some of the higher costs mentioned in the index are attributable to the very strong growth being experienced in the sector as almost 50% of firms recorded an increase in activity over the previous month.</P>
    <P>Recent CSO data show that employment in the financial and other business services sectors increased by 16,300 or 6.4% in the first quarter of 2006. We are now the world&rsquo;s 14th largest exporter of services, a remarkable achievement for a country of just 4 million people. This underlines the competitive strength of our services sector in winning business against strong international competition.</P><Col N="80"/>
    <P>Being one of the world&rsquo;s most open economies has allowed Ireland to prosper for over a decade but also leaves us prone to the pressures of rising external costs. The inflationary impact of escalating energy costs, for example, is a factor every economy is facing.</P>
    <P>The Government is playing its part in influencing inflationary trends by implementing responsible fiscal policies, promoting stronger competition and strengthening consumer protection.</P>
    <P>I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the recently concluded social partnership negotiations where, pending formal ratification by the parties involved, it has been decided to reconstitute the anti-inflation group established under Sustaining Progress with the same membership and mandate as before. The parties are also agreed on the critical importance of bringing inflation down as quickly as possible towards levels comparable with our trading partners&rsquo; performance and towards the eurozone average to secure jobs.</P>
    <P>Public policy, both at central and local government level, and the actions of employers and trade unions will be framed with this inflation target in mind and its progressive achievement over the period of this agreement. It has been agreed in this context that trade unions and employers will respect the terms of the pay agreement, having particular regard to the common objectives of improving competitiveness and living standards by bringing inflation under control. The Government, for its part, will seek to minimise the effect of the public service pay agreement on inflation by actively pursuing the agreed modernisation programme to achieve better value for money in public service delivery.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that reply. I am happy to share his optimism about the underlying strength of the economy. Will he agree, however, that focusing on inflation <i>per se</i> is not enough and that we must isolate the factors over which we have some control, such as domestic pushers of inflation as distinct from international pushers like energy, over which we have no control? In that context, what specific steps does the Minister propose to take in his Department to identify the domestic causes of inflation over which we have some control and the steps he will take to try to reduce or contain those costs because inflation costs are rising faster now than at any time since 2002?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to point out, as the Deputy has indicated, that the recent increases in inflation are largely due to external factors, namely, higher oil prices and higher interest rates. If we excluded higher interest rates and oil prices, the CPI would have gone up by approximately 2.25% to 2.5%, but I accept we cannot do that.</P>
    <P>In terms of our position on inflation, the rationale behind our recent decision on the groceries order was to create a more competitive envir<Col N="81"/>onment in the retail sector. That arose from strong advice from a number of sources and followed on a serious analysis undertaken by my officials in a comprehensive report on that. That is an example of the type of active intervention we took to remove a barrier to competition and thereby create a better environment for prices in that sector. We met with much opposition from within and outside the House. Competition policy is a key area to try to tackle inflationary pressures with a view to creating greater competition and keenness in respect of prices. In that regard, this year I allocated significant additional resources to the cartel division of the Competition Authority to break up cartels in the economy and have greater enforcement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not share the Minister&rsquo;s complacency that our inflation is predominantly internationally generated. If he considers what happened in Ireland compared to the rest of the eurozone, last December inflation was below the European average. We have now surged well ahead of the European average, which suggests we have internal rather than external problems, as referred to by Deputy Quinn. On that aspect, will the Minister put in place some monitoring of cost pressures specifically in the building and oil pricing industries, which are two critical factors for small businesses and businesses exporting? It alarms me that the Minster does not appear to track what is happening in these critical markets despite the evidence on both fronts that Ireland is poorly priced compared to competitors. There appears to be issues that need to be addressed. Will the Minister undertake to regularly monitor and assess the pressures in those sectors?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We constantly do everything we possibly can not just to monitor but to determine the steps we can take to ease the conditions that give rise to higher prices and higher pressures.</P>

	<P>Does the Minister monitor them?</P>

   </Speaker>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and played both sides of the House on the groceries order. I know he would have had a different view from that of the party&rsquo;s spokesman on enterprise because he always favoured the abolition of the groceries order, yet Fine Gael tried to undermine that for political reasons. Every time we try to move on the domestic economy the vested interests come out of the traps and politicians from all sides try to protect them. That is one of the biggest challenges politically if we are serious about opening up the professions and so on. It is time for everybody to get on board and see these issues through because on any analysis, productivity on the domestic side is not as strong as it is on the foreign direct investment side. The absence of competition in a number of the sectors the Deputy mentioned &mdash; construction, professional services and others &mdash; is responsible for that and is leading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The joint European resources for micro to medium enterprise is a joint initiative by the European Commission, European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund, which is intended to improve the access of SMEs to finance within the framework of the European regions. The initiative, which is known by the acronym, JEREMIE, is voluntary and is designed to enable European member states and regions to use part of their Structural Funds over the period 2007-13 to develop financial instruments that are specifically designed to support micro and small and medium enterprises.</P>
    <P>The European Regional Development Fund is a Structural Fund for financing measures to promote development and structural adjustment of regions and the economic and social renovation of areas facing structural difficulties. Structural Funds generally provide financial assistance in the form of grants. Under JEREMIE, however, some of these grants can be transformed into financial products which can be focused at regional level.</P>
    <P>In so far as Ireland is concerned, the framework for the next round of Structural Funds &mdash; the national strategic reference framework, NSRF 2007-13 &mdash; is being prepared and negotiated under the aegis of the Department of Finance. This will outline the strategy for allocating the available European Union funding through operational programmes. The proposal is that the ERDF funding available will be dispersed through two regional operational programmes managed by the respective regional authorities in the Border, midlands and west and south and east regions. Precise details of what these operational programmes will contain have not yet been developed. The possibility of using Structural Funds in line with the JEREMIE initiative will be considered in this context.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the information. Perhaps he might come back to me later, if not today, as regards the following. If they are to be used for micro businesses, surely the county enterprise boards are obvious bodies for administering these funds. Will the Minister indicate, either today or later, the level of funding it is intended to allocate during the programme in the period 2007-13? What differential will there be between the two regions that constitute the country in terms of access to Structural Funds?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="84"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly will come back to the Deputy as regards this initiative. It is worth pointing out that the county and city enterprise boards were already co-funded by the ERDF and to a certain extent have been doing some of this type of activity. Some 40% of grants from county enterprise boards, I believe, were on a refundable basis. This is an increasing phenomenon and it helps them in terms of reallocating resources going forward.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, likewise, in its venture capital programmes, is now taking equity in almost all cases as opposed to just giving straight grants to companies. I like the idea contained here. It dovetails with some of the recommendations in the small business forum or relates to them. As soon as these come closer to realisation, I will be anxious to see how we can make inputs to this to see how we may facilitate the application of the JEREMIE initiative to our domestic situation. I do not have the breakdown in terms of the regions yet, but I shall come back to the Deputy on that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister not alarmed that the recent evaluation of the Community&rsquo;s last support framework for 2000-06, showed under the heading &ldquo;entrepreneurship&rdquo; that the original application of funds was only 10% of all the employability funds that were devoted to entrepreneurship? Only 36% of the target money has been spent to date and the Minister&rsquo;s Department has been unable to give any indicator as to whether achievement has been registered in this section under entrepreneurship. If we are to have faith that the Minister will put a credible package together for the period 2007-13, I want to know why and what has gone wrong with the last programme. Why is the Minister unable to publish proper indicators of performance against targets in that crucial area?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point. However, let us not overstate the impact into the future of ERDF on our business support measures, as the bulk of this will be Exchequer financed. Entrepreneurship in Ireland has gone from strength to strength. The most recent global economic monitor rates Ireland as No. 1 in terms of entrepreneurial activity within the entire European Union. Some 80% of Irish people now perceive entrepreneurship in a positive light.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

Ven<Col N="85"/>ture capital initiatives have been particularly effective and the most recent round I have announced will be even more effective. The results from Enterprise Ireland more or less confirm that. The county enterprise boards have had good success across the country in terms of micro business. That is not to say we can afford to take the foot off the pedal. We must keep pushing, maintain our vigilance and as regards the specific question the Deputy asked, which is not the subject matter of this question, I will come back to him on that.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 78 together.</P>
    <P>Article 10 of the Labour Inspection Convention 1947 provides that the number of labour inspectors shall be sufficient to secure the effective discharge of the duties of the inspectorate and shall be determined with due regard for the importance of the duties which inspectors have to perform, in particular; the number, nature, size and situation of the workplaces liable to inspection; the number and classes of workers employed in such workplaces; the number and complexity of the legal provisions to be enforced; the material means placed at the disposal of the inspectors; and the practical conditions under which visits of inspection must be carried out in order to be effective.</P>
    <P>The ratio of labour inspectors to the workforce shows a marked improvement over the past ten years from one inspector for every 150,000 people at work in 1996 to one for every 67,000 at work at the end of 2005. This is against an increase of over 500,000 in the workforce in the same period.</P>
    <P>The assignment of previously announced additional labour inspectors was completed in November 2005. That brought the complement of serving inspectors to 31. The increase in staffing <Col N="86"/>represents almost a doubling of the number of labour inspectors in the last two years.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment circulated a discussion document, Mandate and Resourcing of the Labour Inspectorate, to the social partners in early 2005. That document was the basis for further consideration by the employment rights compliance group, ERCG. The ERCG, which comprised representatives of the social partners, including the CIF and SIPTU, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, has completed its report. The report, together with the resourcing of the labour inspectorate and options to enhance the effectiveness of our employment rights compliance regime, were considered in the social partnership discussions which concluded recently.</P>
    <P>A major package of measures has been agreed by the parties, including the establishment of a new, statutory office dedicated to employment rights compliance, a trebling in the number of labour Inspectors, greater co-ordination among organisations concerned with compliance, new requirements in respect of record keeping, enhanced employment rights awareness activity, the introduction of a new and more user-friendly system of employment rights compliance, increased resourcing of the system and higher penalties for non-compliance with employment law.</P>
    <P>The number of labour inspectors will be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by end 2007, as part of an initiative to increase the staffing resources of the employment rights bodies generally. Inspectors will be specially selected and trained and will be deployed on a regionalised basis. In addition, the new office will be provided with legal, accounting and other administrative support to ensure its effective functioning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement of the increase in the number of labour inspectors to 90 in the partnership talks. The Minister should have done this some time ago, but well done, nevertheless. I have a couple of questions arising from that. How soon will recruitment begin? Will it be pretty much immediately? Is he talking about the end of 2007 in terms of completion of the recruiting and training process?</P>
    <P>In terms of the number, will the Minister give some indication as to how he arrived at the figure of 90? Did he adopt a particular model or what device did he employ to arrive at the figure? Was it simply a matter of horse-trading among the partnership talks participants, with an arbitrary figure being agreed on? Finally, is language a feature of the new inspectorate? Will some of the inspectors come from the prominent immigrant countries such as Poland and Latvia, or at least will some be required to have a competency in <Col N="87"/>the languages of those majority immigrant countries?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked about the system of recruitment and the time period over which it will be completed. Recruitment will commence pretty shortly. It is intended that the full 90 will be in place by the end of 2007. I remind the Deputy &mdash; Members who have been attending Question Time will be aware &mdash; that there is a considerable amount of work to be done in the process of recruiting people and in training labour inspectors. That was a feature in deploying the 31 inspectors currently in place. The figure of 90 was arrived at in view of the recent history in this area where there were clearly a number of challenges particularly new to us, not least the one mentioned by Deputy Morgan as regards people from other countries who have come to work here. While a preponderance of these people come from three countries, at this stage the Irish economy sustains workers from a great variety of backgrounds and locations with different languages. It certainly would be difficult to provide these skills across the entire labour inspectorate. Currently the practice is to deploy interpreters where necessary. That is being done quite successfully at this stage. Undoubtedly, this is a question that will be looked at in the context of the recruitment of the additional officers. It is intended that the new office will have considerably wider resources available to it in legal and accountancy terms as compared to the situation previously.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>On what statutory basis is it proposed to establish this new inspectorate for workers&rsquo; rights? What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s current thinking on this? Will it be a stand-alone body or will it be linked to the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission? What will be the relationship between the Health and Safety Authority and the Labour Relations Commission, not to mention the Labour Court?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The background to this arises from the document The Mandate and Resourcing of the Labour Inspectorate. Very considerable work was done in this document and the specific difficulties which had arisen were pointed out clearly. Some of these difficulties related to issues such as the poor quality of payslips that were acceptable under the previous regime. Much work remains to be done in that area. It is the intention that the new body and other bodies would liaise and have good relations with the Health and Safety Authority and with several Departments. An interchangeability of information should be facilitated under the new arrangement. This presents challenges and difficulties, but it will be dealt with in the legislative context.</P>

	<P>What is the timetable for the establishment?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The undertaking is to begin immediately, but there are some challenges to be taken on in ensuring that all factors are taken into account and that all information is available to the inspectorate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the evidence of non-compliance? In ten years, we have moved from one inspector for every 150,000 workers to one inspector for every 20,000. That represents seven times more inspection per head of the workforce. This is an extraordinary increase in inspection. Does the Minister of State have any hard evidence of much more abuse? We have had some extraordinary high-profile abuse cases, but it seems that those are issues of poor detection rather than a shortage of inspectors. Is this move &mdash; a predictable decision to create a new office with more staff &mdash; the way to get to grips with the problem? I would like to see some evidence to underpin this move.</P>
    <P>We will not increase compliance burdens, about which the Department is also concerned. We will have intelligent systems for identifying wrongdoing rather than having many people operating systems that are not up to best practice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that Deputy Bruton is not telling me that we will now have too many inspectors. We need to acknowledge, not just on the basis of the high-profile cases but on the basis of other evidence, that there were difficulties. It is incumbent on the Government to address those issues.</P>
    <P>An element of Deputy Morgan&rsquo;s question related to the manner in which the figure of 90 was reached. I agree with Deputy Bruton that it is a very strong response to the difficulties that have arisen. It arose because the Government, along with the social partners, is committed to ensuring that the work of the labour inspectorate is done in an efficient and timely manner. Everyone in the House would agree that is the appropriate way to proceed. There are good reasons to employ the best detection methods to ensure that everyone is treated fairly, especially in a multicultural workforce. However, we also need to acknowledge that the document found that there were major shortcomings besides the need for additional inspectors and these will also be addressed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister of State statistics on the extent of non-compliance?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will provide the Deputy with some information on that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State gave me good information, but he did not answer how he arrived at the figure of 90. Is the figure a thres<Col N="89"/>hold or a ceiling? If the level of immigration continues, will he consider extending it beyond 90? Does he expect the level of enforcement and enforcement actions by inspectors to increase as a consequence of the new recruiting process?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>There will undoubtedly be an increase in inspections, but the greater challenge is to ensure that workers coming into the country and others in the workforce are aware of their entitlements. That kind of information must be disseminated in a much more user-friendly fashion than has been the case heretofore.</P>
    <P>The figure of 90 was arrived at by consensus, as is the case with all social partnership agreements. Everyone came to the table with an acknowledgement that there was a need for an increase. Nobody suggests that this figure will be deficient. Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s question illustrates that very well.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DanWallace"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are to continue our efforts to improve road safety and reduce the number of deaths on our roads, we need to approach the problem from a number of key areas. We must encourage responsibility among road users through an effective and co-ordinated education plan, continually review legislation to ensure that appropriate sanctions are in place for offences and continue our commitment to improving the roads infrastructure across the country.</P>
    <P>Consistent studies have shown that the single biggest cause of accidents on our roads is the behaviour of road users and very often this behaviour is affected by the fact that drivers have consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel. It is significant that the rate of deaths on our roads increases around festival times like Christmas, bank holiday weekends and especially summertime. This is one of the most dangerous periods on our roads, with an average of more than 100 people losing their lives during the three months of June, July and August. The Garda is working hard, with increased levels of enforcement in an attempt to address this problem. However, it is ultimately a matter for individual road users to make responsible decisions and to act responsibly on our roads when driving. There is now a greater awareness among people of the lethal potential of drinking and driving, but we need to continue our appeal to all drivers not to drive after they have consumed alcohol, as even one drink is likely to impair driving ability and judgment.</P>
    <P>Drivers also need to take more responsibility for their actions in the area of speeding. Many drivers, particularly young drivers, do not accept that their behaviour behind the wheel can cause injury and death and we need a concerted campaign to encourage motorists to slow down. I am constantly alarmed that some motorists are regularly behaving recklessly and are gambling with their own lives, and in many cases the lives of their children, by not obeying the seat belt laws. The penalty point statistics show that a vast number of penalty point notices were issued to drivers who were not wearing seat belts. Every day we see parents driving with children in the rear seat without a proper child restraint system or a seat belt. This is crazy behaviour and it seems incredible that any parent would gamble with the life of his or her child in this manner. The message needs to get out that it is as unacceptable as speeding or drink driving.</P>
    <P>The Road Safety Authority has a very important role to play in educating drivers at all levels of the importance of personal responsibility and of exercising caution when driving on our <Col N="91"/>roads. In the past, we saw two different approaches to this education. On the one hand we are familiar with the hard-hitting, often graphic campaigns which highlight the consequences of collisions resulting from a range of issues. Those campaigns have an important role to play in seeking to change driver behaviour and highlighting the tragic results of dangerous and irresponsible driving. In the recent past we have also seen an advertising campaign where a different approach was adopted. It seeks to educate the road user on specific manoeuvres which are considered dangerous. This approach is beneficial to drivers at all levels, even those who consider themselves to be competent and responsible. Novice and experienced drivers should be aware of the importance of lifelong learning when it comes to road safety as none of us is too experienced to benefit from the &ldquo;how to&rdquo; approach which is adopted in these advertisement campaigns. The importance of the advertisement campaigns cannot be emphasised enough as a safety tool.</P>
    <P>The second key aspect of the battle to deal with this problem revolves around appropriate sanctions for people found guilty of offences. In this regard, the Government has an impressive record in introducing new measures to tackle this problem. The penalty points system was introduced, as was a new structure of speed limits and, most recently, the Road Safety Authority was established. This Bill will allow for the adoption of a system of mandatory roadside breath-testing for drink driving with the introduction of a new legislative basis for a prohibition on the use of mobile phones while driving. I welcome the ban on the holding of a mobile phone by a person driving a motor vehicle. I am sure all Members will have seen, as I have, motorists use mobile phones while driving a car, truck or bus. It is difficult to believe that drivers take chances, sometimes in the most unsuitable places &mdash; I have even seen drivers using their mobile phones while reversing their vehicles.</P>
    <P>I agree provision should be made to allow the Minister regulate other uses of mobile phones or other communication devices by occupants of vehicles. The legislation needs to retain flexibility so that it can respond to developments in the rapidly changing area of communications. The penalties that apply must ensure that persons realise that the use of mobile phones while driving is a very serious offence and that if they commit that offence, they will be penalised accordingly. The introduction of both of these measures, allied to the other key features of the Bill, will enhance the powers of garda&iacute; in dealing with unacceptable behaviour by motorists while driving and will send out a further message to motorists that they are required to act responsibly at all times.</P>
    <P>The Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 promoted the introduction of a legislative basis for a form of <Col N="92"/>random roadside breath-testing. In addition, the strategy recommended that private sector interests should be engaged in the provision and operation of equipment used in the detection of speeding offences. While I recognise the need to involve the private sector, I am concerned that the soft option may be used in detecting offenders &mdash; it is important that the Garda is involved to ensure proper use of the equipment, and at the correct locations. As an Opposition Member said yesterday, the main places accidents occur are not on motorways or bypasses, where far too often checkpoints are concentrated, but on secondary roads where the Garda needs to concentrate such operations. If the private sector is involved in these operations, I hope the Minister will ensure it will bear in mind that reality.</P>
    <P>This is a tough Bill but, equally, it is sensible and necessary. It can be described as tough because reckless drivers who put lives at risk will face stiffer penalties. It is sensible because it frees up court and Garda time as well as paving the way for reform of the licensing regime but, most importantly, it is necessary because of the tragic loss of lives on our roads.</P>
    <P>The third aspect of our approach to improving road safety has been the widespread improvement of the national road network and this is a critically important part of our national transport plan. It is a proven fact that accidents are less likely to happen on national primary roads, motorways and dual carriageways than on country roads. The Government&rsquo;s roll-out of Transport 21 will ensure we will see ongoing improvement in the overall road network throughout the country during the next few years. A sum of &euro;1.5 billion will be invested in national roads this year, which will allow for work to start on 15 new projects, while funding has been allocated to local authorities for improvement in national roads in every county.</P>
    <P>Another key factor in improving safety on our roads is the provision of an adequate line and sign programme. I welcome the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to a four-year programme of upgrading road signage and clearer road markings on the country&rsquo;s national road network at a cost of &euro;60 million. The programme will allow for new and improved directional signage, new tourism signage and updating of existing signage. Consistency in road signage is crucial, together with standardised road signs positioned in the right place, a key factor in making journeys safer and easier. I also welcome the allocation of &euro;20 million for the fitting of safety barriers on all motorways and dual carriageways as these measures have proven to be crucial in reducing road deaths in circumstances where accidents occur.</P>
    <P>Some other areas also need to be addressed if we are to seriously impact on reducing the number of deaths on our roads. We must accept that with the changing population trends here, <Col N="93"/>more foreign people are living here and, consequently, driving on our roads. This is a reflection of a changing Ireland but it also presents new challenges for road safety authorities. It has not gone unnoticed that a number of tragic collisions in recent weeks in Donegal, Cork and the midlands involved migrant workers who lost their lives in particularly tragic circumstances. I am aware that the Minister recently launched a foreign language project targeting minority ethnic groups in the community, and this is a welcome start. However, we need to do much more to educate foreign nationals to ensure that they are fully aware of the type of behaviour that is expected when driving on Irish roads and to alert them to the potential dangers and the areas to watch out for when driving in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another area that needs attention is drug driving. We hear a great deal about the impact and consequences of drink driving, however, not enough attention is given to the impact and consequences of people driving while under the influence of drugs, sometimes illegal drugs but often prescribed drugs. We are all aware of the manner in which prescribed medication can impair one&rsquo;s ability to react to circumstances. The time has come for a proper appraisal of the level of fatalities caused by people driving under the influence of drugs as opposed to alcohol. This will not be an easy task but if we are serious about tackling all the causes of carnage on our roads this issue needs to be considered and addressed.</P>
    <P>One further issue that the Minister has attempted to address, but which will certainly require further attention, is the large number of provisional drivers on the roads. I am aware the Minister recently brought forward an initiative to deal with the backlog of driving tests and the training of driving instructors. However, this is an issue that needs to remain very much on the agenda. It is unacceptable that we should tolerate a position whereby an individual can fail his or her test and then drive away from the test centre alone. A more integrated structure is called for where greater emphasis is placed on pre-test lessons with qualified instructors, with the aim of increasing the test pass rate. This will not be easy to achieve, nonetheless, we must endeavour to arrive at a position whereby there is a reduction in the number of provisional drivers on our roads and introduce a system whereby there is proper supervision of drivers until they have passed their test.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>This is the sixth major legislative initiative taken in the area of road traffic in recent years. The penalty points system was introduced, as was a new system for the independent licensing of taxis, hackneys and limousines and a new structure of speed limits and, most recently, the Road Safety Authority was established. This clearly shows the commitment of the Government to deal with the unacceptable level of road deaths in the State. <Col N="94"/>Sadly, many road deaths are preventable. It is the responsibility of all of us who use the roads to act responsibly. Road safety is a subject that needs to be tackled on several fronts. It is an acknowledged fact that one of the biggest challenges we face in Ireland is that road collisions are inevitable and that road deaths and injuries are part of daily life, albeit a deeply regrettable one. That need not be the case. We are all aware of the statistics, that nine out of ten road deaths in Ireland are as a result of bad driver behaviour, with speeding, drink-driving and non-wearing of seat belts the main causes of death. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to allocate unprecedented resources to this area means we can change the situation and leave nobody in doubt about the Government&rsquo;s serious attitude to road safety. The provisions of this Bill and the severity of the penalties for those found guilty of serious driving offences underline its seriousness. If we can combine the Government&rsquo;s commitment with increased Garda enforcement and a greater acceptance of personal responsibility on the part of drivers, these new measures will help to stamp out irresponsible and dangerous driving and so save lives. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute on this important legislation and wonder whether we can ever legislate for human behaviour. Driving is as important to people as the three Rs that were such an essential part of our education, yet this has never been recognised. Nowadays, people as young as 14 or 15 get the opportunity to drive, particularly on farms where they have quad bikes etc. and we must recognise the reality of the developments that have taken place.</P>
    <P>In this context, there is no reason, other than failure to engage with the teaching profession, boards of management and school managers, why driver education has not become an integral part of the school curriculum from junior certificate to leaving certificate level. Pupils are as entitled to earn marks for being good, competent drivers as they are for being good at maths or Latin. I learned Latin, which was a help to me when studying law, but driving skills were as important to me.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the reality that young driver education will cost money. We use all sorts of excuses to avoid committing to this. I have no doubt that if we engaged with school managers, the teaching profession, representatives of the TUI, the ASTI and anybody else, they would be positive towards it as many of them have sons and daughters in school. It is important we recognise that we must introduce this education, train <Col N="95"/>people and inculcate good habits at an early age. This learning process should be an integral part of the curriculum, be examined and count for examination points.</P>
    <P>The first five lessons should be provided free to pupils. We must support that idea to ensure we provide the best to our children. If pupils start right, they will finish right and will not learn bad habits. They will learn good habits early. Driver education should be an educational process. Ireland has become paternalistic and everything is now regulated. I am a lawyer, but I realise that people sometimes rebel against regulations. We must remember there are individual freedoms and try to get the driver education process right at the beginning.</P>
    <P>The number of learner drivers driving unaccompanied is a major issue, but we can get over that problem through proper driver education. However, we must give consideration to the issue of allowing young people out on the road in 3.3 litre cars. There are no restrictions here on the type of car young people can drive. In other European countries, people under 21 or 22 years of age cannot drive powerful cars. I know young people in less powerful cars might still have accidents, but we should take into consideration the power of a 3.3 litre or 2.5 litre car compared to a 1 litre car. While the smaller car can still travel at a fast speed, it cannot attain the speeds of the more powerful cars.</P>
    <P>We must try and tie in restrictions on the size of a car young people can drive with insurance. We must ensure that insurance companies will not insure powerful cars for people under 20 or whatever is the appropriate age. They have a role to play in this regard. Insurance companies have been doing well, particularly as a result of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Their profits have gone through the roof, but this is not reflected in ordinary motorists&rsquo; insurance at the same level. Insurance companies are slow to publish their profits these days because they are so significant.</P>
    <P>The public perception of legislation is that the authorities often take the soft options with regard to enforcement. For example, people often note that garda&iacute; lie in wait with their hand-held speed detectors at 11 p.m. on good straight stretches of motorways. Why is this and who sends them out at this time? The public feel that much of the legislation we pass is a money-gathering exercise. If that is the general perception, the situation is serious. The result is that legislation does not get the respect it should.</P>
    <P>Very few of the major accidents occur on motorways or the high grade dual carriageways throughout the country. Speed is a dangerous factor in most serious accidents, particularly on poor or minor roads. Many of these roads do not have adequate signage and markings because local authorities are not provided with adequate <Col N="96"/>funding for this work. They need resources to ensure dangerous bends are brought to people&rsquo;s attention, proper grading is done and speed limits are implemented. In order to get people to respect the legislation we must ensure they understand we are not just taking the soft option. They must realise the regulations are for their benefit and the common good.</P>
    <P>Detection of speed offences must, obviously, be a priority. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not the private sector, are the proper people to operate speed traps. This is a public issue and should not be delegated to private agencies such as happened with clamping. I know country people who have come to Croke Park on a Sunday, parked near The Big Tree pub and found their cars clamped on their return. These are people who only get to Dublin once in a blue moon for an all-Ireland final. People who park all around the Croke Park area find their cars clamped on these occasions. This happens because clamping has been delegated to private interests and I have received complaints from rural people about this.</P>
    <P>Will the same happen with regard to speed detection? How can we ensure profit will not be the motive? We have much to consider with regard to this legislation. The regulations to be introduced must be circumscribed and streamlined. I favour Garda operation of speed cameras and am very concerned that detection may be put in the hands of the private sector.</P>
    <P>We can never beat the old phrase, &ldquo;Care, courtesy and consideration on the roads&rdquo;. This is what we were told in primary school and we were given the old blue book that contained such advice. We might be as well off doing the same and publishing a card that would explain people&rsquo;s role to them.</P>
    <P>On another issue, can the Minister tell me why I can travel from Dublin to Kinnegad by motorway at 120 km/h, yet the limit is reduced to 100 km/h on the stretch of the road from Kinnegad to Mullingar? This makes no sense. The limit should be 120 km/h the whole way. People travelling on that road see no difference between one stretch of the road and the other, apart from the sign to say the speed limit is 100 km/h. A driver driving at 115 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 120 km/h who suddenly comes to an area with a limit of 100 km/h might be caught by a hand-held speed camera despite doing nothing wrong.</P>
    <P>The regulations will provide for many things. I welcome the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, in many areas it could become a lawyer&rsquo;s paradise. I do not say that for self-gain.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The last thing we need is legislation that might become a lawyer&rsquo;s paradise. I welcome the legislation, the thrust of which is to provide for greater care and security on the roads. We cannot have too much of that. Deputy Penrose spoke about the many motorists travelling to Croke Park who find after the match that <Col N="97"/>their cars have been clamped. That is a problem. However, the other side of that coin is that Croke Park has a capacity of 80,000. Up to this point, the Gaelic Athletic Association has not taken any steps to provide a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> of approximately one mile in radius within which motorists would not be allowed to park, as had been proposed ten or 12 years ago. It was proposed to the local authority that park and ride facilities would be provided once the project was complete.</P>
    <P>The Iona and District Residents&rsquo; Association and the Croke Park Area Residents&rsquo; Association presented a set of proposals to the Minister for residents&rsquo; permit parking as part of an overall programme to deal with parking on match and concert days. This would apply to Croke Park and Dalymount Park. I understand the Minister has reviewed the proposal but has yet to give his response. I would like to see an amendment to this legislation to include the care and safety of residents and spectators coming to Croke Park and other stadia.</P>
    <P>Most of the provisions in the Bill are practical and useful. Random breath testing should have been introduced long ago so that a garda did not need to have a suspicion that a driver was drunk before carrying out a test. Apparently this is the norm in Europe and I welcome its introduction here. The obvious place for a checkpoint is at the gateway of a pub&rsquo;s car park. Garda&iacute; occasionally turning up at public houses at closing time would deter drivers getting into their cars.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about the failure to reduce the blood-alcohol limit. The current limit of 80 mg per 100 ml is retained, whereas the European norm is 50 mg per 100 ml. I expected this legislation to introduce the European norm rather than sticking to our own standard. It would have been useful to introduce a 0 mg per 100 ml requirement for learner drivers. As they are on probation, drivers with a provisional licence should not be expected to have alcohol content in their blood in any circumstances. That issue has not been addressed and leaves us out of sync with the European norm.</P>
    <P>The proposals on drink driving offences will probably represent the most useful amendment to the legislation. Today a drink driving offence carries a sentence of one year&rsquo;s imprisonment. The offence of dangerous driving causing death or serious injury carries a minimum sentence of two years. I presume these cases will no longer be taken in the District Court but in the Circuit Court. At present, the majority of cases of dangerous driving causing death or serious injury are dealt with in the District Court. Why has this been allowed to continue? Now that the offence of dangerous driving causing death or serious injury carries a minimum sentence of two years, it means that the jurisdiction of the District Court cannot apply and such cases will automatically need to be taken in the higher court, which is a <Col N="98"/>welcome development and will represent a major deterrent.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it was necessary to introduce a new offence of striking a bridge. I would have thought that all infrastructure would be similarly affected and it should not have been necessary to name a specific piece of infrastructure such as a bridge. Others could also have been mentioned. No doubt the Minister has some arcane explanation.</P>
    <P>Only in recent years have we seen the consumption of alcohol increase dramatically here. We have moved from a nation of moderate drinkers 20 years ago to one of the highest consumers of alcohol in Europe today with a 49% <i>per capita</i> increase in ten years. We are top of the European league for binge drinking with more than 40% of men and 60% of women having more than six drinks when they go out drinking on any occasion. Alcohol consumption per adult in Ireland is 56% higher than the European Union average. There are reasonably high consumption amounts among some of the migrant workers who have come to our country just as there is a high proportion among them of accidents on the roads. The cost to the Exchequer attributable to alcohol abuse is approximately &euro;3 billion. Some 40% of traffic deaths and 30% of roadside deaths relate to drink driving.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Penrose said about education is very important. The way forward is by taking preventive measures at the earliest possible stage. The penalties prescribed in the legislation are necessary and must be effective, which is another day&rsquo;s work. However, young people coming through school should have a proper knowledge of the rules of the road. They need to be taught how and when to drive. It needs to be made quite clear to them that alcohol should not be consumed prior to taking a car, bicycle or motorcycle onto the roads. This can best be done in schools.</P>
    <P>The least said about the equipment available to the Garda, including speed cameras and intoxilyzers, the better. Today the Committee of Public Accounts revealed that 50% of speed cameras are defective. Some 100,000 photographs were defective and could not be used, resulting in people getting off scot free. Intoxilyzers are being challenged in court all the time. Scarcely a week goes by without more cases being thrown out of court because of defective equipment or legislation which did not allow a case to be mounted successfully. This legislation is needed but so too is a culture of responsibility in the manner in which we drive and use the roads. This must begin in homes and schools.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the Road Traffic Bill 2006. I was about to offer my good friend, Deputy Costello, an opportunity to use some of my time because I was enjoying his speech so much. Without being flippant, with regard to his reference to <Col N="99"/>country people being clamped in the area around Croke Park during games, perhaps he should ask his party colleagues on Dublin Corporation to cease this disgraceful activity. Perhaps if the Dublin team does well on Sunday and the weeks thereafter, fewer country people will come to Croke Park this year. I am sorry if those comments upset Deputies.</P>

	<P>I thought Deputies were supposed to uphold the law.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>My point was that Dublin people should go to Croke Park more often.</P>
    <P>I welcome my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera. I am always comfortable speaking in her presence because she is a former Deputy for a constituency which included Tallaght.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Tallaght again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may be too young to remember the Minister of State in that role but I do. She did great work as a representative for the area. It always cheers me up when great colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wondered how Tallaght could be brought into the debate. The Deputy mentions it torturously.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason it can be brought into the debate is that every day I start my work in Tallaght where people talk to me about issues, including road traffic accidents, as I go about my business. In addition, the constituency I represent, Dublin South-West, includes Tallaght, the third largest population centre in the country. It is good that all Deputies bring to their work in the House their own experiences.</P>
    <P>In supporting this important Government Bill I express my support for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, in his endeavours which have, in the past three months, delivered the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 and the Road Traffic Bill 2006, both of which promote road safety. I ask the Minister of State to convey my good wishes to the Minister whose work is welcomed by members of the public.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to upset Deputy Olivia Mitchell again, on my walkabouts in my constituency and during my weekly clinics in Tallaght, Templeogue, Greenhills and Firhouse, an area she represented until recently, I note people have a strong interest in road safety. I share the widespread concern about the unacceptably high level of deaths and injuries on our roads.</P>
    <P>All Deputies can bring their personal experiences to this debate. I have been lucky while driving, apart from being involved in a crash in 1981 in Clara, the home village of the Minister for Fin<Col N="100"/>ance, Deputy Cowen. Although not a serious accident, the memory of it has stuck with me for 25 years. Like other colleagues, I have considerable experience of friends, neighbours and family members being killed in road traffic accidents. A couple of weeks ago my family celebrated the life of an aunt of mine who was killed by a car outside RTE in Donnybrook 30 years ago. I mention this because it highlights the fact that people remember and talk about road traffic accidents regardless of how long ago they occurred.</P>
    <P>Many tragedies have occurred in all our communities and Deputies will be able to relate personal stories of people being killed or injured on the roads. They may remember a particularly sad accident involving a mother and child, Pamela and Thomas Boylan, from my parish of Fettercairn who were killed in a crash in Blessington. Such incidents bring home to us all the importance of vigilance on the roads. Members will also note from visiting homes to sympathise with families bereaved by road traffic accidents that such deaths affect the wider community. It is good that the House records this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister for Transport that the key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users. Positively influencing such behaviour should form the primary focus of our road safety strategies. To this end, the Minister&rsquo;s proposals to clear the unacceptable backlog in driver tests, regulate the driving instruction sector and driving tests for motorcyclists and the subsequent reform of the driving licence system are necessary and urgent.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the delivery of the remaining outstanding initiatives identified in the road safety strategy approach. It seeks to adopt a system of mandatory roadside breath-testing for drink-driving, introduces an administrative alternative to a court hearing for certain drink-driving offences and a new basis for a prohibition on the use of mobile telephones, allows for the engagement of private sector interests in the provision and operation of safety equipment and promotes a range of initiatives relating to driver formation. I welcome the fact that all these issues stem directly from commitments given in the road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>Before I was interrupted, I had intended to compliment Deputies on the Opposition benches, particularly Deputy Olivia Mitchell, on their work, and I do so now. Speakers referred to the role of education in dealing with the issue of road safety. It is easy to argue that a great deal of this work should be done in schools. We should encourage schools to transmit to pupils a positive road safety message. I still remember a bygone era in Dublin when horses and trams were used for transport and I travelled from Crumlin to my school in Clarendon Street. Although I cannot recall some events which occurred yesterday, I remember, even then, that teachers told students to be careful going home. In those days, one trav<Col N="101"/>elled on one&rsquo;s own or was brought to school by an older child who lived on the same road. I still remember the lessons we were given on being careful, even though Dublin was completely different then. It is important to promote a positive road safety message among young people.</P>
    <P>I will not dwell on the issue of alcohol abuse because it was discussed in detail by other speakers. People out enjoying themselves are not always happy about the vigilance shown by the Garda in this regard but it is important that garda&iacute; continue to make a major effort to ensure people are safe on our roads. This not only relates to those who get behind the wheel or mount a bike while under the influence of alcohol but the danger they will cause to other people.</P>
    <P>With regard to mandatory testing, like all Members, I am fully aware that drinking and driving is recognised as one of the most serious contributory factors in road collisions. Evidence shows that the problem is worsening in younger age groups. Despite much publicity and targeted campaigns, some drivers are not willing to change their behaviour. The number of deaths on our roads will not decrease unless strong measures are introduced and enforced to bring about the necessary change in attitudes.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister confirmed that mandatory alcohol testing has been the subject of lengthy consideration and consultation, including significant engagement by the Office of the Attorney General, supported by independent legal advice. I hope this section will discourage the rampant attempts by drivers found to have excess alcohol in their systems to take advantage of legal loopholes to avoid the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P Just="Left">All sides in this House agree on the need to introduce an immediate ban on the use of hand held mobile telephones while driving. This Bill provides specific responses to the concerns of the Oireachtas about mobile telephones and other equipment by providing for a ban on the holding of a mobile telephone by a person while driving a motor vehicle. It also provides that the Minister may regulate for mobile telephone use generally, as well as other in-vehicle technologies of an information, communication or entertainment nature, for the purpose of preventing driver distraction arising from the inappropriate use of such technologies. Given the pace and scale of innovation in these technologies, it is sensible and necessary to confer such enabling powers on the Minister. In addition to a maximum fine of &euro;2,000, the commission of an offence of holding a mobile telephone while driving will attract the endorsement of four penalty points on conviction, which will serve to demonstrate the Government means business on this vital aspect of driver behaviour. I urge the Minister to engage with mobile network operators on a publicity campaign to encourage all car users to fit car kits in advance of the introduction of the regulations. God knows what people will be using in 50 years. <Col N="102"/>As Members can attest, mobile telephones can be a nuisance but they are a fact of life.</P>
    <P>I support the provisions on driver licensing, which include the introduction of a learner permit to replace the provisional licence and a requirement that learner drivers undergo a formal course of instruction. The lessons given by parents and siblings have a role to play in learning to drive but it is essential that learner drivers take a set minimum number of formal lessons before taking the test. I encourage the Minister to consider a system involving the private sector along with the existing public testing system so all current provisional licence holders can be tested as soon as possible.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I failed the driving test when I first took it and am not sure whether I passed it on my second attempt. That failure caused me a lot of bother and grief. I eventually passed my test on the north side of the city, which is probably why it took me so long to do so.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Speeding continues to be a major contributory factor in the deaths and injuries on our roads. The best way to ensure greater compliance with speed limits is a wider deployment of speed cameras. The purpose of these cameras is to encourage road users to remain within the speed limit, particularly in locations where dangers of speed related crashes are known to arise. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that there will be no direct link between the fees paid to the private operators of these cameras and the number of detections.</P>
    <P>I served on Dublin County Council from 1991 and South Dublin County Council from 1994. During my tenure as mayor, between 1999 and 2000, the council twinned with Bad Segeberg in Germany, for reasons which I could never figure out. On one of the few visits I paid to that northern German town, I observed the effective use it made of speed cameras. People became aware when they passed cameras and the town made significant amounts of money from the fines it imposed.</P>
    <P>Speed cameras could be effective in changing people&rsquo;s attitudes. I do not want to criticise the garda&iacute; but I have often been asked why they hide in bushes or behind walls along the Belgard Road. Somebody else may be able to defend these tactics but if they prevent speeding, that is welcome. I support the target of checking 11.1 million vehicles for speeding annually. While there will be many loud complaints during the <Col N="103"/>early days of speed cameras, they are a necessary part of the strategic approach to road safety.</P>
    <P>Other colleagues remarked on the importance of maintaining roads in good repair. There is a fine network of roads around Tallaght but a number of gaps remain in that regard. The people in south-west Dublin realise the need for an extension to the Tallaght bypass, as do drivers taking the shortcut to County Wicklow. Where the need for extensions to the road network is identified, we have to make sure the NRA responds. I do not wish to be parochial but the Tallaght bypass is a dangerous road on which people have been hurt and killed. I will continue to raise that important issue.</P>
    <P>I am a strong supporter of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been since I first moved to Tallaght in 1969. I come from an era in which the only contact I had with garda&iacute; was when they tried to take the ball I played with on the roads of Crumlin but we should not underestimate the contribution they make to road safety. The establishment of a dedicated Garda traffic corps with an allocation of 60 officers per quarter represents a significant delivery on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the immediate challenges presented by those who continue to perpetrate traffic offences.</P>
    <P>It is important that we are having this debate. I have listened carefully to the contributions of my colleagues and realise the problems encountered by Deputies are duplicated throughout the country. I commend this Bill to the House and look forward to supporting it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies McHugh, Gregory and Catherine Murphy.</P>
    <P>The Green Party supports the broad measures outlined in this Bill. It is receiving widespread support because of the outrage at the ongoing carnage on our roads and the requirement for legislators to do whatever possible to halt the tale of tragedy.</P>
    <P>I was in a pub in Leitrim at 1 a.m. recently and I do not know what the licensing arrangements were but I am sure what happened was not legal. A Garda drew up outside the pub, where music was being played. It sounded its siren and we left the pub. I remarked that this was a nice Irish way of accomplishing this without creating hassle. As I was standing outside the pub, two men emerged who had consumed many drinks. The publican told them the direction the Garda car had taken. The implication was that it would be safe for the two men to drive in the other direction.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>What did Deputy Ryan do?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I advised them to walk. This is typical of what happens in every pub in every town, and we must change. The attitude of a nod <Col N="104"/>and a wink and accepting avoidance of enforcement is a culture that does not help us.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme shortly before that had shown a young man who was crippled for life in a road accident. He would spend up to 50 years in a wheelchair and his family would have to support him for this period. It was a heartbreaking scene but one that could have been avoided. The excessive level of accidents on our roads should not be tolerated. To reduce it we must change the attitude that we turn a blind eye by telling people coming out of a pub which way garda&iacute; have gone. We must enforce our traffic regulations or we will continue to have young men and women in wheelchairs for life or killed. For this reason I support the Bill.</P>
    <P>On an average three mile trip one makes approximately 450 decisions, many of which are made subconsciously. One makes decisions when one sees another driver considering overtaking and moving out. Out of 450 decisions, each of us will make one mistake. The vast majority of mistakes do not lead to collisions but on average, of every 50,000 km we drive, we will make a mistake that causes a serious collision. Anything we can do to reduce the number of mistakes is a positive development. Drinking alcohol drastically changes the number of mistakes made at the lowest level. Driving with a mobile telephone in one&rsquo;s hand alters the number of mistakes we make and will lead to increased carnage if we allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>While enforcement and education are needed, good engineering is also required. Outside the gates of this House, there is no safe way to cross from Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel to Leinster House. The pedestrian crossing arrangements are unacceptable. We must concentrate on that if we are to take road safety seriously.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>While I support most of the provisions in the Road Traffic Bill, I am uneasy at the proposal for the engagement of private sector interests in the operation of cameras and other technology for the detection of speeding offences. Speed cameras should be strictly in the hands of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities. As an essential part of the administration of justice, it should be under the control of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, the other provisions of this Bill are necessary and long overdue.</P>
    <P>The dreadful daily loss of life on the roads and the injuries suffered require that severe measures are taken to reverse the trend. Everyone is aware of the widespread practice of using hand-held mobile telephones while driving. There is no excuse for this because it is hazardous and hands-free kits are readily available.</P>
    <P>This is particularly reprehensible in the case of drivers of HGVs who speed along narrow roads with one hand holding a mobile telephone. They know that in the event of a collision with a car, the occupants of the car will suffer. Drivers of <Col N="105"/>HGVs who breach the law should be severely dealt with and specific attention should be given to this issue in the Bill. The speed limit for HGVs is 80 km/h. Has anyone seen a HGV remain below the limit on the open road? I have not but I have never seen the issue highlighted by anyone except the relatives of victims of accidents involving HGVs.</P>
    <P>The problem is exacerbated by the lack of enforcement and the lack of garda&iacute; to carry out enforcement. This Bill will be ineffective if enforcement does not receive high priority. While the Bill can progress key initiatives to assist in tackling the current unacceptable level of road deaths and injuries, that progress will be almost entirely dependent on the ability of the Garda to enforce these and other existing measures.</P>
    <P>A serious and inexplicable omission from the Bill is a reference to drug testing. There is little doubt that the widespread use of cocaine and other drugs is a contributory factor to road accidents. This has been taken seriously in Britain and other countries. It will be interesting to hear the explanation for this omission from the Minister. Perhaps some measure will be considered by him on Committee Stage. I take this opportunity to wish Mr. Gay Byrne well in his new role and hope that he meets with success in his objective. Apparently, he does not want this Bill to be delayed by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>As I represent constituents who live in the environs of Croke Park, it would be remiss of me not to draw attention to the problems traffic poses for residents on the occasion of major matches or concerts. I ask the Minister to initiate measures to address the matter. When 80,000 people descend on Croke Park or other major event centres, the residents who live nearby become virtual prisoners in their homes. They desperately need the introduction of resident-only parking schemes in specified residential streets on match days. In a recent parliamentary reply, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, stated that the Department is examining current legislation on this issue. When the matter was raised at the city council, the executive manager stated that there is no provision under road traffic legislation to provide resident-only parking on residential public roads.</P>
    <P Just="Left">If this is to be achieved for one day events at specific locations, the Department of Transport must change the existing legislation. The Minister recently met a delegation of residents on this issue and was supportive of its proposals. A permit-based system, similar to that of Britain, could be enforced within a one mile radius of major stadia, allowing only residents to park on local residential streets. Will a measure be introduced to permit local authorities to introduce such schemes when and where required? I understand the Minister will not do this in the context of this Bill but will he state how and when this issue might be considered because it will not go away? <Col N="106"/>I hope the Minister indicates he will address it soon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Road Traffic Bill 2006. I am not convinced that the provisions of the Bill will make a meaningful contribution to driver behaviour on our roads or will have any effect on the reduction of road deaths. I say that because I am convinced that the legislation currently in place, if implemented, would make a major contribution to improving road safety but is not being implemented simply because the Garda manpower is not in place to ensure enforcement. There is no point in introducing legislation here when there is no possibility of it being implemented due to shortage of Garda manpower.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Road safety is being managed on a public relations rather than a practical, effective basis. The public relations philosophy is evident every year at Christmas time and at other festive times of the year. There are television and radio interviews with high-ranking garda&iacute;, backed up by television footage of Charlie Bird, or some other Charlie, getting excited while speaking above pictures of traffic on a dual-carriageway somewhere near Dublin. It would be too expensive to move out to the country to narrow roads, where late at night the accidents generally occur. The subliminal message being received by the public is that the only times the law is enforced are when we are advised by a big public relations spree on national television, and at other times &mdash; the other 11 and a half months of the year &mdash; we need not worry because there is no enforcement. That is an irresponsible message to give out.</P>
    <P>This public relations circus was further highlighted by the appointment of Gay Byrne as chairman of the National Safety Authority. We had just got rid of Gay Byrne from the national airwaves and after suffering the trauma of being exposed to him for so many years, now the Minister for Transport foisted him on us again. Have we not been exposed to Gay Byrne too much over the years without having to suffer him for longer?</P>

   <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>That is unfair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event, it has not worked because Gay Byrne is the news and the road safety message he is supposed to be imparting to the public is consequently lost. As usual, he cannot confine himself to his brief. He must stick his nose into other people&rsquo;s business, like giving a commentary on the Opposition in this House or calling us &ldquo;the other shower&rdquo;. Will the Minister tell Gay Byrne to mind his own business, do his job and let us do ours?</P>
    <P>More public relations stunts are performed by the Garda on dual-carriageways and national routes, where up to six garda&iacute; may be congregated to carry out speed checks. That can be most <Col N="107"/>annoying and is a waste of scarce Garda resources. First, that number of garda&iacute; is not required to carry out speed checks and, second, the deaths are occurring not on dual-carriageways or motorways, but mainly on county and regional roads. It is time to ease up on the public relations, get practical and deploy the scarce Garda resources to the areas with the problems and at hours when accidents are generally known to occur.</P>
    <P>The lack of personnel to enforce the law is glaringly obvious in the enforcement of penalty points. The penalty points regime was launched in a blaze of publicity. The general reduction in the speed of motorists was obvious and remained so for some time, but then the penny dropped with motorists. The system was not being enforced, with the result that the speed limits are being ignored again.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The extension of the penalty points system, from an initial four offences to 35, has further diluted the effectiveness of that system. If the manpower was not there to enforce the original four offences, there is no hope of enforcing 35 offences. Offences now subject to penalty points include failure to leave appropriate distance between one&rsquo;s vehicle and the vehicle in front, which is totally unenforceable. Consequently, that dilutes the effect of penalty points.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am generally supportive of the objectives of the Bill. While there is no doubt that legislation is needed, for example, to make illegal the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving, it is enforcement, not legislation, that brings about results, as we saw clearly with the introduction of the penalty points. While one might ask what if the deployment of resources continued, the Irish Presidency of the European Union then kicked in and certainly broke the momentum. When the levels of enforcement fell, the levels of compliance fell. Legislation, of itself, will not make an impact, no matter how good it is. That sent out a clear signal which people understand.</P>
    <P>Many of the measures that will assist in reaching the targets set out by the European Union are already in existence. There are mountains of data at local authority level, where the Garda and the members of the roads departments in local authorities go out and map locations where there have been serious injuries or where there has been a fatality. One can clearly see the cluster areas where, for example, the roads are a contributory factor. Where there is a profile of accidents, rather than merely collecting data, the authorities should respond. Instead they wait for the provision of a dual-carriageway to bypass a town.</P>
    <P>Often it is a matter of road maintenance. Local authorities not cutting grass verges and developers leaving debris on the road, for example, lead to climbing accident rates. These might seem <Col N="108"/>like small matters but they can be dealt with immediately. My point is that this is not about legislation.</P>
    <P>Driver behaviour in terms of speed, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol and the use of hand-held devices contribute to accident rates. One trend that has become a real scourge is that of the night-time boy racers. I refer not to the lads in cars with flashy hub-caps, in which the radio volume is raised to the point where the car almost has a rhythm of its own, but to organised racing at night-time, which is evident in most communities. That is becoming a serious problem.</P>
    <P>It is very annoying that available resources like the GATSO van and hand-held devices for speed checks are deployed, for example, at 9 a.m. outside Liffey Valley almost every Sunday morning when there is little traffic or outside Heuston Station on the way out of town where there is not a single pedestrian in a segregated situation. This results in the Minister losing the goodwill among motorists for enforcement and compliance. They see that it is a matter of shooting fish in a barrel and of income generation rather than a road safety issue.</P>
    <P>Another important issue relating to road safety, which one will not see in a Bill like this, is the need to increase public transport. If one gives people an affordable means to get to and from work, one will reduce the number of people at risk. That can be done by use of the small public service vehicles and the taxi system, which is becoming a nationwide entity due to the designation of taxi-meter areas. The dispute with the taxi interests in this regard must be tackled head on because such designation will make a meaningful contribution.</P>
    <P>Last night I attended a meeting of an organisation, the Kildare Road Users Association, that has just been set up by various interests to see what can be done by people generally to improve safety on the roads. At the meeting a young man in a wheelchair as a result of an accident relayed his experience and what he wants done about ensuring road safety is prioritised. There have been several meetings of that association in Kildare. There is no doubt that there is goodwill among the public for proper enforcement. Unless this Bill and other measures are matched by adequate resources, people will feel badly let down and the carnage on the roads will continue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Johnny Brady.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. A total of 399 people died on our roads in 2005 while 185 have died so far this year, an increase of 5% on the same period last year. There has been a major outcry in the media and among the public about the behaviour of road users. The sad reality is that many of the victims did not behave badly on the road but they were caught up in <Col N="109"/>tragic accidents caused by the negligence of other drivers. Every town and county has been affected by the carnage on our roads and something desperately needs to be done, particularly in regard to driver behaviour. While young drivers are often blamed, older drivers are worse offenders in a number of categories.</P>
     <P>The Bill is a welcome development, although I am concerned about a number of sections, which I will address later. However, it is only part of the solution to the problem. Many other issues must be addressed such as road engineering and the quality of road surfaces. Repairs to roads should be carried out so that there is minimum danger to road users.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Section 4 provides for mandatory breath testing. I welcome the introduction of this provision. This system has been operated in Spain for several years and I met people who had been randomly breath tested there. When a person can be randomly breath tested at any time, it acts as a significant deterrent, even for those who might want to take a chance and have one or two drinks. Our attitude is that it is fine to drive if one has had two drinks but it is important that young people should be educated that they should not drink at all if they intend to drive. Ireland has a relaxed attitude to drink driving. I welcome the provision whereby the place where the random breath testing takes place and the date and the time is included in the written authorisation of a Garda inspector or someone of a higher rank. That is an important regulation. I am surprised the regulation on involving the private sector, for example, in speed detection does not seem to be quite as strict. Random breath testing will result in greater detection and, ultimately, in a change in behaviour. Many young people are conscious of the dangers of drink driving and they do not drink and drive while drivers aged 35 and over are more inclined to take a chance. Driver education is important and random breath testing is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Section 5 introduces a new system of fixed charges. Given that such breath testing may result in a significant increase in the number of people breathalysed who are marginally above the legal limit, the introduction of fixed charges is a good idea. Offenders can pay a &euro;300 fine and be disqualified from driving for six months. That provision will address marginal cases and it will result in a change in attitude to drink driving. I also welcome the extension of the disqualification period for certain offences.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for a ban on the use of hand held mobile telephones, a maximum fine of &euro;2,000 and four penalty points. Provisional licences will be replaced by a learner permit. It is positive that people who seek a learner permit will be obliged to take a driving course. However, I refer to the regulations covering driving schools. How will learner drivers know who is accredited? <Col N="110"/>How will they know where to go to take the course and how will they be confident the relevant standards are being met?</P>
    <P>Under section 9, when a person passes the theory test to obtain a learner permit, he or she will not have to undertake another theory test when taking the driving test. That will free up driver testers. Applicants must correctly answer 35 out of 40 questions in the theory test, which is onerous and thorough. Many provisional licence holders probably have a greater knowledge of the Rules of the Road than many full licence holders, which is a positive development.</P>
    <P>Under sections 12 and 19, garda&iacute; can detain uninsured vehicles registered outside the State. Many foreigners who travel around the country speed on our roads. A highly publicised case reached the courts recently in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency. The driver was travelling at 200 mph and while he was prosecuted and fined, his licence could not be endorsed. Can anything be done to address this issue? Drivers from other jurisdictions have a relaxed attitude to the State&rsquo;s road traffic laws. Can significant deterrents other than fines be introduced in co-ordination with other states?</P>
    <P Just="Left">The privatisation of the enforcement equipment for speeding has attracted most comment. Like many drivers, I am critical of the way speed limits have been enforced in the past. I do not know how many times I have come across garda&iacute; on the side of the road in a 30 km/h zone in both urban and rural areas. I regularly drive through a 30 km/h zone on a bad bend outside one rural town, which is immediately preceded by a 100 km/h zone. That is fine if one knows the road and is aware of the location of the sign but I do not know how many times I have passed a Garda car on the other side of the bend waiting to nab drivers as they reduce speed. Such detection is the cause of much cynicism among road users. We all want boy racers and others who speed outrageously on our roads prosecuted because it is unacceptable behaviour. Do 30 km/h zones carry so much danger? If all other speed limit zones were as well policed, it would be reasonable to focus on the 30 km/h zone. While if one is travelling at 35 km/h in such a zone, it is an offence and it should be stopped, resources should be deployed in areas where the greatest number of accidents and offences occur.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the central focus of the initiative is on saving lives rather than earning revenue. While I do not doubt him, when the private sector took over clamping operations in Dublin, it turned out to be a revenue generating exercise. The Minister further stated there will be no direct link between the fee paid to the private operator and the number of detections but when the legislation is passed, how will we know how this provision will be implemented? We will have to wait to judge whether the Minister&rsquo;s sentiment is reflected in practice.</P><Col N="111"/>
    <P>I referred to the written authorisation for random breath testing. However, the location of speed cameras will reflect both the experience of speed-related collisions and the evidence of a history of speeding. The Minister stated this project will be under the control of the Garda both at the strategic and operational levels but the Bill does not provide that a written authorisation is required to carry out speed checks at various locations. Unfortunately, the same degree of strictness does not apply to this measure. Hence, one can only assume this will be much looser. Consequently, can Members be assured that the Minister&rsquo;s sentiments, as outlined in the Bill, will be carried out in four or five years&rsquo; time?</P>
    <P>The target of checking 11.1 million vehicles annually for speeding is ambitious and will make a significant change to matters. Although I am familiar with the Minister&rsquo;s point that the Garda cannot operate this system without the private sector, I wish to sound a note of caution regarding this measure. While, overall, I welcome the points made in this Bill, Members must wait and see whether it turns out to be a genuine success.</P>
    <P>I agree with a point which has already been made, namely, that the enforcement of this Bill after its enactment will be critical. Most people would agree that, over the years, many measures have become law but have not been fully implemented. Such measures are not fully enforced on the roads. Had they been fully enforced, they might have made a significant impact in this regard. Hence, I commend this Bill to the House and hope it will be passed quickly. More importantly, I hope it will be enforced when it becomes law.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill clearly shows the commitment of the Government to dealing with the scourge of road deaths. Dealing with road accidents cannot be seen purely as the remit of the Government. It is up to all of us to address this scourge as quickly as possible. The Bill outlines the statutory background to a range of specific measures set out in the road safety strategy 2004-06 and it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The best experts have been available to us to try to devise strategies that will reduce road deaths. Some commentators have tried to corral the Government into making quick decisions on the enactment of legislation. However, if Members have learned anything from the past, it is that rushed legislation never provides the best framework for a comprehensive approach to dealing with any matter, including road deaths. This is why I believe the background work that has been carried out and the comparisons with other jurisdictions in terms of how they have handled this problem will provide a meaningful and comprehensive set of measures that will address the problem of road deaths.</P><Col N="112"/>
    <P>While it is the remit of Government to enact legislation to set out proper guidelines for behaviour on the roads, it is up to all road users to play their part. All citizens have a responsibility to look upon road travel as a privilege rather than a right. In this way, they will be obliged to utilise the road in a way that is safe not just for themselves but for others. The legislation is of the utmost importance. It has been claimed that it has taken a year to get to this stage, which is due to the reasons outlined. One must put in place a comprehensive package of measures.</P>
    <P>In my short time in the House, the issue of road safety has been a topic which has been discussed more frequently than many others. There is a good reason Members have debated this matter so often. This is a critical national issue which is being discussed in every parish and community. The matter is of concern to everyone because all either know or are related to someone who has been involved in a serious accident in recent years. From the outset, the Minister has shown a willingness and desire to tackle the scourge of road deaths. He has outlined his approach to the House on many occasions.</P>
    <P>While much of the publicity tends to focus on road deaths, the serious injuries that occur in road accidents are also a major cause of concern. Many people have been maimed for life as a result of road accidents and some are confined to wheelchairs in hospitals or other institutions. Their lives have been destroyed.</P>
    <P>It is of critical importance to adopt a united approach to putting in place a culture that does not accept the present level of death and destruction on the roads. The legislation will be helpful in contributing to this in terms of its carrot and stick approach. People must be encouraged to be more responsible on the road while putting in place measures which will penalise those who show scant regard for their lives and those of others.</P>
    <P>It is important to view the issue of road deaths in the context of the greater number of cars on the road. If one examines the period in which the Government has addressed this matter, the number of road deaths has decreased. In the past year, there has been a blip in the pattern which some have suggested was due to a lack of conviction or work on the part of the Garda in terms of finding law breakers.</P>
    <P>Any attempt to change society must address attitudes and culture. Some people have little regard for road usage. An interdepartmental task force was mentioned. Perhaps the Minister will refer to it and its level of development when he concludes. The task force would bring together the Department of Transport and the Department of Education and Science, which has made initial comments on what it proposes to do in respect of educating young people on road usage as part of the curriculum at secondary cycle.</P><Col N="113"/>
    <P>The leaving certificate examination season is drawing to a close and, while many young people have focused on it as a major element in their lives, it will become secondary for those who go to college during the coming years. A significant decision in their lives will be to find jobs, a by-product of which will be the requirement to have cars. In this day and age, there is nothing more important than educating young people in such a way that they have respect for the privilege of road usage.</P>
    <P>In this Bill and other legislation, the Minister has outlined the updating of the penalty points system, to which I have given a cautious welcome. From the outset, I signalled my opposition to the overuse of penalty points as a deterrent. In their early stages, they were effective in identifying a number of key road safety factors and ensuring the stick element of the carrot and stick approach worked. However, the system loses its impact if there are penalty points for too many offences.</P>
    <P>People have spoken about getting penalty points for turning right on a main road, driving in the wrong lane or crossing a lane. These provisions take the matter too far and have the potential to lose the public&rsquo;s enthusiasm. If the system is restricted to the main problems of speeding, drink driving &mdash; which is covered in terms of disqualification &mdash; seat belt wearing and general disregard for the lives of others through dangerous driving, it will keep the focus on penalty points and, through their use and punishments, derive the anticipated benefits.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties experienced by the Minister and his officials in trying to draft legislation that takes account of the changes in the communications infrastructure, that is, the penalty points associated with the use of mobile telephones. Like other Members, I am on the road regularly. Members travel continually, by day and by night, and have all encountered or experienced dangerous driving. All have experienced the misuse of mobile telephones.</P>
    <P>One morning, on my way to the House, as I passed through the M50 roundabout at Blanchardstown, I saw a woman with four or five children in her car. She held her telephone to her ear with one hand and had a cigarette in her mouth, while her other hand was on the steering wheel. This was dangerous to the woman, her children and other travellers. I walked to here from the Department of Foreign Affairs one morning and saw a chap on a bicycle with a child aged four or five on the crossbar. He had one hand on the bike and held a mobile phone in the other. We see lorry and bus drivers driving through our towns and villages. One day I met a cattle lorry with a trailer, the driver of which had one hand on the steering wheel and held a mobile phone in the other. I am sure my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, will convey to the Minister that the use of mobile phones <Col N="114"/>while driving is causing a serious threat to road users. I am glad this issue has been tackled at last.</P>
    <P>We also know the problems with which Northern Irish drivers on our roads confront us. The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, Deputy English and I all travel the M3 at our normal speed and see these people overtaking at great speed. I hope Ministers here and in Northern Ireland can come together and ensure Northern Irish drivers and drivers from the Republic are penalised on the same terms.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>With the agreement of the House I wish to share time with Deputies English and Deenihan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill. It gives us the opportunity to examine the entire area of road safety. I wish to raise a number of issues, some of which are covered in the legislation and others which should be.</P>
    <P>I will put this debate in context. Every 23 minutes an accident occurs on Irish roads. Some are fatal, some cause serious injuries, ambulances must be called to some and others are only material damage accidents. Every 22 hours at least one fatality occurs on Irish roads. That is someone&rsquo;s mother, father, brother, sister, son or daughter. That is what we are discussing, not statistics.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that every Member of the Government parties who spoke on this issue put the blame solely on drivers. They never mentioned road conditions, engineering, enforcement or resources. The key elements of road safety seem to be gone out the window. It all seems to be the fault of drivers, which is not the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to privatise speed cameras. Last night during his Second Stage speech, the Minister tried to give reassurance that these cameras will not be a cash cow for the private sector. It is extremely difficult for us to believe that when we see the situation regarding the national car test. People believe it is a cash cow for the company involved.</P>
    <P>It is also difficult for us to believe it when we see the instructions given to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to hit the quota every month by catching people just inside the speed limit zone. It is like shooting fish in a barrel. No matter what the Garda Commissioner or assistant commissioners state, quotas regarding the enforcement of road traffic legislation and speeding fines do exist.</P>
    <P>Unless checks and balances are put in place, privatised speed cameras will become the rural equivalent of the clampers in Dublin and other cities. The objective itself, to reduce traffic speed on many of our busiest roads, is commendable. The number of road traffic fatalities has enor<Col N="115"/>mously increased during the past 12 months and urgent action is needed. However, we do not want to see the public funding another element of private industry. Sadly, to date this Government&rsquo;s record in the privatisation of various operations has ended up with the consumer paying more without an improvement of service.</P>
    <P>The type of contract that will be put in place is critical. I urge the Minister to ensure the contract is based on the reduction of the average speed along particular sections of road. Before any speed camera is put in place, it should be discussed with local communities and they, in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should decide where speed cameras are to be placed. They deal with the problem of people coming into their communities, breaking speed limits and having blatant disregard for road traffic legislation on a day to day basis. I hope the Minister will amend the Bill when he has the opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One fifth of road deaths so far this year have been of non-nationals. Before we had an increase in the non-national population, the statistics showed that up to 15% of accidents involved foreign drivers, many of whom had driven on the wrong side of the road. In 2004, 40% of two-vehicle collisions involved vehicles that went to the wrong side of the road. I am sure the statistics for 2005 is an increase on that and that the statistics for 2006 is an increase on that again. No recognition has been given to that growing statistic.</P>
    <P>Every local authority must erect multilingual signs to make non-national drivers aware that they must drive on the left-hand side of the road. They are used to driving on the opposite side of the road and it is extremely disorienting for them when they come here. When PPS numbers are given to non-nationals, copies of the rules of the road should be distributed with them in the person&rsquo;s language of choice so he or she can understand them. Proposals were put to various Ministers with responsibility for the environment and transport in the past on the installation of electronic devices in vehicles which could remind non-national drivers they must drive on the left-hand side of the road. It is a significant issue which is being ignored. It cannot be brushed under the carpet.</P>
    <P>I want to raise other points in my limited time. This Bill deals with the issue of drink-driving, but the issue of people driving on prescribed medication is being ignored. Most speakers discussed drink and illegal drugs. However, prescribed medication which impedes driving is just as dangerous and that is not made clear to people. GPs have an onus to ensure they warn patients of the implications of taking medication and clear and concise information should be available on it.</P>
    <P>More than one fifth of accidents here happen in poor visibility conditions on wet roads, in snow, <Col N="116"/>fog or mist. In Florida in the United States, legislation is in place which makes it compulsory to turn on dipped lights when the wipers are turned on. When we travel here, we all see people in poor driving conditions with no lights on or with just parking lights on. They are virtually invisible to other drivers. The legislation needs to be changed to address this. I proposed a change in the Act of 2001 but it was ignored by the then Minister of State, Bobby Molloy. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, now has an opportunity to amend the legislation. If people have cause to use their wipers, they should also turn on their dipped lights. Research has shown this will reduce road fatalities by ensuring vehicles are highly visible.</P>
    <P>Pedestrians and cyclists who are not lit up and wearing reflective armbands or other reflective gear should be liable to prosecution, or at least to a fine. They are criminally negligent if they do not have such gear. One cannot ignore the number of pedestrians being killed. A significant contributory factor is their invisibility on our roads. Every single motorist I have spoken to on this issue in recent years has stated he or she has had narrow escapes because of the invisibility of pedestrians. There is an onus on the latter to be visible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the chance to say a few words on this Bill. I do not have much time and will just address a few aspects of it. My colleague mentioned the condition of our roads and the weather but there is a more significant issue at stake, which is not mentioned in the Bill and which was not mentioned by the Minister in his contribution. The Minister referred to the increased number of cars but did not state that the condition of the roads, especially back-roads, is absolutely brutal. In congested counties and in the greater Dublin region, the sides of roads are falling apart and there are massive potholes. Many of these are being created on foot of the increased number of motorists avoiding congested towns. We call the routes on which they drive &ldquo;rat runs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem but we are not addressing it. It will contribute and has contributed to deaths. Last night in my parish, a 19 year old lost his life in the early evening on one of these famous rat runs. He would not have been on that road only for serious traffic problems in the town. These problems take time to fix but if motorists are to use rat runs, let us repair them and have them in good condition. Let us fix the roads that are falling apart.</P>
    <P>My county is under serious pressure because of the volume of traffic and the roads are a mess, thus contributing to people dying &mdash; it is as simple as that. We can enact all the legislation we want but if we do not provide good roads, more people will die. I ask that the Departments work together to solve this problem. Money should be invested in the roads.</P><Col N="117"/>
    <P>Reference was made to having better training for motorcyclists. If a motorbike going at a normal speed hits a pothole, it will go over the hedge or into a tree or pole. A massive pothole in a road is a deathtrap. Surely to God red flags should be erected where there is a hole in a road and the bloody thing should be fixed. It is not that hard or costly to do. What price is a life?</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction but, as the Minister knows, it will not solve the problem. He hopes to introduce another road traffic Bill before the end of the year. One must ask what we have been doing for the past five or six years as road carnage has become increasingly worse. We have all spoken about road traffic problems over the past few years during Private Members&rsquo; time and Question Time, yet a half Bill is being introduced and another is to follow in a couple of months. This is not a new topic and I wonder why there is not greater urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the annual number of deaths could have reached 550 or 600 under certain circumstances. There were 399 last year and nearly 200 to date this year. This is far too many because any road death is one too many. Most road deaths are not the result of accidents but the result of incidents caused by error, bad driving, including speeding, or bad conditions. A small number of accidents will always occur but most deaths are not due to them. It must be said the Government is to blame for many of the deaths. Although driver error is part of the equation, the Government is to blame for its total lack of urgency in dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>When certain individuals were appointed to office, they announced their aim was to reduce the annual number of deaths by 150, as if to say 250 is an acceptable number of deaths on our roads. It is far from it. We should be aiming much higher to try to effect great changes.</P>
    <P>On the specifics of the Bill, I welcome the privatisation of responsibility for speed cameras. I mentioned this four years ago in the House and many others spoke about it also, yet it is not happening to a sufficient degree. This Bill does not go far enough in this regard. I want to ensure the locations of speed cameras will not be advertised so motorists will not know where they are. We should go a step further and try to have speed cameras in various vehicles, even tractors. Until such time as drivers do not know the location of speed cameras and fear that there might be one around any bend or in any hedge or tree, they will not slow down and drive properly. The fear of being caught is the greatest deterrent to any crime. Speed cameras, therefore, should be in as many places as possible and hidden such that they might have an effect.</P>
    <P>We debated the use of mobile phones in vehicles some months ago and I will not do so again. Suffice it to say that I am delighted there are relevant provisions in the Bill. They are needed badly and must be enforced. The Bill will <Col N="118"/>scare people in this regard because the penalty points for using a mobile phone while driving are sufficiently high.</P>
    <P>Consider the provisions in respect of learner permits to allow one to do driving courses. We must really improve driver education. The current test is not good enough. It is a joke and does not assess one&rsquo;s driving. We need to demand a higher driving standard and I ask the Minister for Transport to provide for the possibility to apply for advanced driver permits and encourage greater driving ability among all ages. I ask that he talk seriously to the Minister for Education and Science with a view to including driver education on the curriculum.</P>
    <P>To drive in this country is perceived as a right. It is not a right but a privilege and it should be earned. We should demand that it be earned through doing a proper test. I would introduce an assessment for those who are currently fully licensed. Motorists should be assessed every ten or 15 years and should be advised and reminded how to drive properly. I say this because it is not only young people who drive badly on our roads.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the provision for random breath testing to counter drink driving. It should have been introduced years ago. It is not only young people who are drink driving &mdash; it is mostly middle aged and older people who are doing so through force of habit and they are the ones to whom we must send a very strong message.</P>
    <P>I accept there has been a greater garda presence on the roads in the past month or two. I have encountered six checkpoints and have seen seven or eight garda&iacute; checking for speed in the past month alone. I am impressed with this and it should continue. If it continues and is not just for show every so often, it will improve driver behaviour. This Bill is only a step in the right direction and we need many more provisions and a bit of imagination. We need to train people to drive properly and demand that they do so correctly.</P>
    <P>I am fed up going to the funerals of people, who should still be alive, because of an incident involving a car on the road. A car is a lethal weapon. If driven dangerously, too fast or under the influence of alcohol, one should be prosecuted for attempted murder, and nothing short of this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill. The Minister should note that it amends six major Acts dating back approximately 45 years. Approximately 400 regulations are in some way governed by all these Acts. I recently spoke to a solicitor who deals with many road offences and is an expert on this area, on which he has written a book. He told me the regulations are virtually unreadable and legally incomprehensible at this stage. It may be time to consolidate all the Acts into one major road traffic Act. This would obviously involve a large amount of work. The Minister may refer in his response to the fact that the 400 regulations governed by the Acts are virtually unreadable. <Col N="119"/>How could the ordinary person be expected to cope if the legal people are expressing concern about the accessibility of those regulations?</P>
    <P>I was asked some weeks ago about the new version of the <i>Rules of the Road</i>, which had not been published at that time. The original <i>Rules of the Road</i> are approximately ten years old. Will the Minister of State confirm whether the updated version has been published?</P>
    <P>As regards education, the rules of the road should be taught to every primary and post-primary student. Previous speakers said schools should provide modules on driving. They could be started when the students are at a young age by teaching them the rules of the road, how to drive a car and be aware of the mechanics of a car. That is not happening. It is being done in some schools as part of transition year but there is not a set national programme to put that into effect.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provision on mobile phones but legal people tell me there may be a difficulty in enforcing that measure. The Minister of State might refer to that. If somebody is seen using a mobile phone they can drop it or put it in their pocket. This measure may be difficult to enforce unless a person stopped at a roundabout, traffic lights or elsewhere is observed using a mobile phone.</P>
    <P>I regret I do not have more time to debate the Bill because it is an area in which I am interested. The question of valid authorisation appears cumbersome and random testing will be difficult to enforce. Who will decide whether to test somebody who shows no signs of having taken a drink? That is subjective and I foresee problems in that regard. Overall, the Bill is welcome and if it saves the life of one person it will be worth its passage through the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers I welcome the Bill, which is a useful provision. There is broad agreement among Members of the House on its provisions.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting anybody has done so but we should resist adopting a preacher tone in the House of &ldquo;do what I say&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;do what I do&rdquo; because if we start telling people they should be doing this, that and the other, some of our comments will come back to haunt us.</P>
    <P>We should resist blaming young drivers or women drivers, who are the easy targets, for everything that is wrong in road traffic. The reality is that we have some difficulties that must be resolved and this legislation will go some way towards doing that. I commend the Minister for introducing this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to anybody who travels the country that the road network is constantly improving. The main roads are particularly good. Reference was made to the need for well-engineered roads. I could not agree more. The more recent ones are <Col N="120"/>examples of high quality engineering but there is no doubt that our secondary and lesser used roads are still not up to the standards all of us would wish. Quite a number of roads still have badly maintained surfaces, potholes and so on and as Deputy English said, if a motorcyclist hits a pothole, regardless of whether it is big or small, the chances of that person surviving are not great.</P>
    <P>To this day I have a memory of a Sunday afternoon many years ago when I was no more than seven or eight years of age. I was sitting on a wall in front of a neighbour&rsquo;s house when a motorcyclist hit one of those potholes and a fatal injury was suffered by one of my friends sitting on the wall beside me. The carnage continues.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, with such a volume of car ownership and traffic levels generally it is surprising there has not been an even greater level of carnage on our roads. I do not in any way condone the numbers killed, which are horrific. On a Friday, Saturday or Sunday morning one is guaranteed to hear that on a well-maintained or new road somebody or a number of people have been killed, very often in single driver accidents.</P>
    <P>The mentality of the population concerning drink driving is changing dramatically. That is particularly true in the case of younger people. It is somewhat unfair to say young drivers drink and drive. They do not. Many of them do not drink and drive because they have paid a small fortune not just for the car but for the sound system that thumps out music as they drive along. Drink is not an issue with many young drivers but it is an issue with many mature drivers who take a long time to give up old habits. New ways of getting the message across are required. I am impressed by some of the recent advertisements on television. They are dreadful to watch but the message sinks home.</P>
    <P>I spent a few days in the south west over the bank holiday weekend and saw many public houses using a local taxi service, and paying for it, to ferry home some of their customers. That is a welcome trend. If somebody wants to have a few drinks they can do so and then travel home by public transport or transport provided by somebody else.</P>
    <P>How far away are we from being prepared to tolerate a zero alcohol limit when driving? I was not a Member of this House when an attempt was made by a previous Minister to lower the blood alcohol limits. I believe, and I will not be popular for saying it, that we should work towards the European levels because it is no longer tolerable for somebody to drive with any level of alcohol in their blood.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for mandatory alcohol testing, which I support. Like other speakers, I saw an increased presence of Garda checkpoints and other checks over the past few weekends. I do not mind if I see five or six garda&iacute; manning a traffic checkpoint and pulling in seven, eight or nine cars at a time. It frightens the daylights out of most <Col N="121"/>drivers but the message goes out quickly that garda&iacute; are out in force and we must be much more careful. We must leave the car at home and use the designated driver.</P>
    <P Just="Left">On the issue of blood alcohol levels, it is unsatisfactory for anybody to say there is not a mechanism to monitor the level of drugs in one&rsquo;s system. Anybody who sees the prevalence of cocaine and other drugs being mixed with alcohol knows well that a huge number of people are driving around with a high level of drugs in their system. I read some research mainly done by UCD and in 2000 and 2001 &mdash; this goes back to a piece from 2004 &mdash; 1,000 samples revealed legal limits of alcohol or no alcohol level at all. Out of those 1,000 samples, however, 679 tested positive for drugs. Those positives may have resulted from prescription drugs or insulin that might have been in people&rsquo;s systems. Nonetheless, the individuals&rsquo; driving would have been impaired.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister of State to work towards enabling the carrying out of research. I am aware that even in Scandinavia, which has a highly developed system for monitoring substances in the blood, the authorities have not yet managed to devise a tamper-proof system as regards the presence of drugs. It is not good enough to merely state, as one Minister did in 2002, that matters need to be taken more seriously. Professor Denis Cusack of UCD said in recent days that the most dramatic element of his team&rsquo;s research in the past two years has been the number of driver blood samples testing positive for cocaine. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, said that it does not appear that anyone has yet cracked the issue. However, we are anxious to move ahead because it is a matter of growing concern. Perhaps some PhD research student might provide valuable insights into how to overcome that particular problem.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to knowledge of the rules of the road. I totally agree. When I first started teaching, it was expected that students in fifth and sixth class should, as the Minister of State will recall, be taught the rules of the road. People knew them in English and in Irish. I do not know what has happened to all of that but the practice should be reintroduced.</P>
    <P>We carried out a very valuable exercise in Dublin and I believe it is still being done. There was a fine traffic school in Clontarf to which children at primary and early post-primary school level could go. There was a track there for them to travel around, mostly on bicycles. Obviously, they did not have access to cars. They were tutored on how to negotiate roundabouts, what to do when coming to a yield or stop sign, etc. Some Members might recall participating in such exercises when they were still at school. I support those who argued it would be a worthwhile exercise for a module to be introduced in transition year where students would have access to motor vehicles of one type or another.</P><Col N="122"/>
    <P>There is a tendency for parents, particularly those in Dublin, at Christmas and also when their children make their communion or confirmation to buy small quad bikes, micro motorbikes or scooters for them. On Christmas morning last year, I was driving in Glasnevin towards the N2 when I met three small quad bike users coming in the opposite direction, on the wrong side of the road. They were aged 12 to 14 years. Luckily, it was Christmas morning and there was virtually no traffic on the road. Increasingly, however, we see these bikes being used in neighbourhoods in Dublin. I ask that those who advertise in newspapers to the effect that these can be bought and are safe to reconsider their actions. They may well be safe, but they are illegal. The Garda has repeatedly said that it is illegal for those under 16, without a licence tax or insurance, to use them. The Garda in the Finglas-Ballymun area is impounding them, but I have seen them being fairly widely used elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the following is an example of what goes on at night when the roads are pretty clear. Over the bank holiday weekend, owners of quad bikes in County Kerry raced each other along a very busy beach. Indeed, motor cars were being used to do wheelies, hand-brake turns etc. Driving along some of our newly opened roads, such as, for example, the N2, one sees tyre marks which indicate that much reckless driving has taken place in recent weeks.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The issue of speed limits has been mentioned. It baffles me that there can be such incoherence regarding the way that the speed limit system is operated by local authorities. Everybody talks about the area from the Red Cow roundabout to Newlands Cross and beyond. I talk more about those urban or almost inner city areas where there are traffic limits which clearly are too high and ought to be reduced. I strongly support the idea of having a 20 km/h speed limit in residential areas. Many people would welcome that and it ought to be enforced. In my view, it could be enforced.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to cars from other jurisdictions being used by people from other parts of the European Union and outside it, as well as those from Northern Ireland, and driven at very high speeds and carelessly on our roads. The Bill provides that penalties can be enforced against such drivers in the same way that they can be used against anyone from this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has had cause to use some of the arterial routes where heavy vehicles drive will know that few if any of them adhere to the 50 km/h limit. I wonder whether there is merit in trying to enforce the speed limiter issue on trucks and indeed on cars. I am quite impressed by what I have heard from people even older than myself who suggested that earlier in the life of this State there were speed limiters on cars for drivers who had recently passed the driving test. I am not sure <Col N="123"/>whether that is the case but if it is, it would be worthwhile reintroducing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnny Brady mentioned the difficulty relating to the enforcement of penalty points. The British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, which I have the honour to chair, is working towards trying to persuade the British and Irish Governments to introduce a mutual enforcement of penalty points, North and South. That would be a significant measure if it were introduced.</P>
    <P>The Garda traffic corps is an important new development in enforcement. Deputy Naughten referred to the issue of resources. It is clear that the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government are providing resources to the Garda traffic corps. Rather than its members driving up and down relatively empty bus lanes or swanning around on high-quality bikes, however, there should be greater levels of enforcement by the Garda traffic corps. I have yet to see a member of the Garda traffic corps get off his or her bike and relieve a traffic jam at a junction, for example, or take a proactive measure that would make a difference to the use of the road. However, I look forward to the greater use of the traffic corps.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I wish to reiterate something I have stated previously, although I presume it will again fall on deaf ears. Dublin is twinned with San Jose. I visited the latter city in 1998 and I was impressed then by the level of on-board computers that are available to the police there. I cannot understand why the Garda does not have such technology, which provides ready access at a checkpoint to drivers&rsquo; details. These details should include whether the person has a valid licence, whether the car being driven belongs to that person, the level of insurance relating to the vehicle and so on. This would be better than waiting ten days before a driver decides whether to provide the relevant information at a Garda station. It is a question of tightening enforcement and regarding this issue as important.</P>
    <P>The matter of mobile phones has been debated to death. It is clear that anybody using a mobile phone in a car should have a hands-free kit. I have not gone into the minutiae of how to enforce what is proposed. On balance, we should wait to see if it is enforceable. I have no doubt that some lawyer is probably waiting for an opportunity to test whether this provision is valid. We have all seen drivers &mdash; we may be obliged to include ourselves in this regard &mdash; talking on their phones while trying to reverse up laneways. That is irresponsible and criminal and it endangers other road users.</P>
    <P>I do not have a great difficulty with the issue of privatising the service relating to the provision of speed cameras. As long as the service is effective, plenty of cameras are provided and used and <Col N="124"/>there is no abuse of the data compiled, I do not have a problem. The so-called &ldquo;hair dryers&rdquo; are a deterrent and the more of them that are brought into use the better. I would prefer to see these instruments used on minor and secondary roads. Even though I have no difficulty with them being used on motorways, the fish in the barrel syndrome has been mentioned. It is more likely that they would be more effective on lesser roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 19, which deals with the detention of uninsured, untaxed and unlicensed vehicles. We have come through a period in which there were many such cars on our roads. There is an ambiguity regarding the entitlement of the Garda to seize such vehicles. I am pleased that this is being dealt with in the Bill, which I welcome.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Lynch.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I welcome the measures proposed in it. However, it indicates the slowness of the Government to respond to what has been a frightening increase in fatalities and road accidents. We are all conscious of the tragedies associated with the statistics. When we say that 374 people were killed in 2004 and 395 in 2005, it can sound cold and barren. If we think of each individual that was killed having a family that grieves to this day, it sets the figures in a different context. The Government response has been disappointing. Questions must be raised about the Government when such a serious issue is well known, well publicised and well debated and when its response has been very slow. At times, its response has simply been incompetent.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions in respect of random breath testing and dealing with the loophole on uninsured foreign drivers, as well a ban on holding mobile phones while driving. I must confess that I, like everyone else in the House, am a sinner on the latter score. It is an important measure and I welcome that the ban will be put in place.</P>
    <P>As spokesperson on health, I am conscious of the impact that the extraordinary level of alcohol consumption is having on our society. Anybody who has had occasion to visit an accident and emergency department at the weekend can see the direct effects of alcohol abuse. Some people can become extremely sick from the amount of alcohol consumed, while others can be injured by a fall or by violence caused by the consumption of alcohol. It was startling to read a report to the effect that Irish people spend a greater proportion of their incomes on alcohol than their counterparts in other European countries. The report in question stated that alcohol kills 115,000 people in Europe. However, Irish people spend three times more on alcohol than those in other countries and ten times more than the Greeks. One can say that the cost of alcohol is higher in <Col N="125"/>Ireland but we should be mindful of this warning sign. We cannot continue to be the binge drinkers of Europe. We cannot continue to have such a high level of alcohol consumption without paying the price. We are paying the price in terms of road accidents and ill health.</P>
    <P>We were told that it was impossible to introduce random breath testing due to constitutional issues. Suddenly and inexplicably, the Government changed its line. To have a system in which people have confidence, there must be evidence that it works. If random breath testing is to work &mdash; I hope it does &mdash; it will be tested in the courts. We have quite a tradition in that regard. The Government&rsquo;s penalty points scheme was welcomed warmly by the Opposition but public confidence in that system has been dramatically eroded by a level of incompetence that is hard to fathom. The Committee of Public Accounts produced information showing that 50% of speed cameras do not work, which is inexcusable. In commenting on this, Deputy Shortall stated that in the absence of extra garda&iacute; to intercept offending motorists and with a dedicated traffic corps only being established, speed cameras are vital in doing the work for which there is simply not the manpower to carry out. She indicated that this is merely the latest flaw in a penalty points system which promised so much when it was first announced but which, sadly, has failed abysmally to live up to the hype. She pointed out that it took three years for the number of offences covered to move beyond three, while the entire system has been dogged by various legal challenges and loopholes that have allowed offending motorists to get off scot free.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of County Wicklow, a judge recently threw out 152 speeding summonses. A total of 238 cases relating to offences of speeding along a particular section of road have been dismissed. The judge was clearly exasperated by the lack of information coming form Wicklow County Council. A basic task for a Minister introducing such a new scheme is that he or she would make sure it is implemented properly. Nobody expects a Minister to operate a speed camera or impose a fine but we expect local authorities to be formally advised as to how they can carry out the task they were set. That did not happen in this case and it has not happened in the case of other counties &mdash; County Wicklow is not unique in that respect. Many people are understandably cross about this. The people with a grievance are those who paid their fines when they were informed they had incurred penalty points for a speeding offence when driving through Kilmacanogue village, for which a fine applied. I have discovered there is not a procedure in place for those people to get a refund or to have those penalty points removed from their licences even though, according to the law and the judgment of Judge Murrough Connellan, they were not guilty of an offence. That seems harsh, and it under<Col N="126"/>mines people&rsquo;s confidence and commitment to road safety if we have this kind of fiasco.</P>
    <P Just="Left">A low speed limit applies to that stretch of road in County Wicklow as that national primary route goes through a village, which is unusual, and that has been a cause of some concern. There is a pedestrian bridge over the road but it is not properly lit at night, youths gather there and some people are frightened to cross the bridge at certain times and they take a risk when crossing that busy road. There are a number of existing dangers of which we must be conscious. The fact that a local authority and a Department are not able to ensure there is sufficient joined-up Government to make sure any Government proposal is implemented speaks volumes on how this Government is operating.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have made a point regarding education which I wish to raise. I hope the Minister for Education and Science will take on board the need to encourage and develop the skill of driving and respect for the rules of the road among young people. In transition year some students take driving lessons, for which they usually have to pay. That cost discriminates against young people from low income families who need to acquire the skill of driving. If a module on driving was made part of the school curriculum, respect for the rules of the road was developed from an early age and the provisions of legislation were properly implemented, we would have a much better chance of ensuring people would not end up dead or seriously injured in car wrecks. When one reflects on the number of young people who are grossly disabled and whose lives are impaired having survived serious car accidents, it brings home to us the level of carnage on our roads.</P>
    <P>A point was made that some road fatalities are attempted suicides or suicides, an aspect of which we must be conscious. The introduction of an anti-suicide strategy may also help in reducing at least some road deaths.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A point that needs to be made is that while this legislation is welcome it is long overdue. This debate is about taking responsibility for a problem that has robbed us of almost 2,500 lives in the past six years. The Government is not solely to blame for these deaths. There are a number of causes, including individual driver behaviour, driver error, vehicle standards and driving conditions, but the Government is charged with addressing these causes. This Bill should have been introduced a long time ago.</P>
    <P>As road safety has improved significantly throughout western Europe on a percentage basis, Ireland is the only exception to that trend. Last year road accidents accounted for almost 400 deaths, and the trend this year indicates that figure will be matched. It should make for morbid reading for the Government and for Garda management because these figures prove measures <Col N="127"/>being taken to encourage greater road safety are not adequate.</P>
    <P>It is primarily up to the Government to make sufficient resources available to the Garda and for it to use the Garda effectively to reduce the carnage on our roads. That is the central point of this debate. Will the necessary resources be put in place to ensure this Bill will be effective? In the run up to the previous election, the now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised that a 600 strong Garda traffic corps would be put in place but that is predicated on the recruitment of an additional 2,000 garda&iacute;. The people were told in 2002 that this would happen if the then Government was re-elected. We have now been told that will not happen until early 2007 or perhaps later because the figures and the dates change and they will continue to change.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of record that at least 80% of accidents are caused by human error. Despite campaigns to promote a greater safety consciousness, the causes of accidents remain speeding, drink driving and a cause of major injury is and will continue to be the non-wearing of seat belts.</P>
    <P Just="Left">When driving home the other night and I saw two garda&iacute; checking cars on the road and while one might say that is welcome, they were on duty on a major road and not on a byroad, backlane or ditch where most accidents occur. They stopped every motorist ahead of me to check if motorists and passengers were wearing seat belts and as I did not see any motorist being asked to pull over to the side of the road, I gather all the motorists and passengers were wearing a seat belt. The majority of road deaths do not occur on the main roads of Cork, rather they occur on roads leading to seaside resorts, backroads and country roads and while driving on those roads I have never been stopped a garda. The speed traps in Cork are located mid-way down a section or at the end of a motorway where accidents, in the main, do not occur. Deputy Carey said he felt the equation of speed traps with fish in a barrel was unfair. The scarce resources that are available should be deployed on roads where accidents occur, namely, late at night on country roads on which one will never see a garda checkpoint.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the realisation that there will be a Garda presence on roads has a salutary effect on the behaviour of people, with last week being a case in point, but in the absence of the promised traffic corps, this response is often sporadic and seasonal in its application. There is a responsibility on road users to exercise care and safety, and the majority of them do so, but the number of cars on the road is increasing all the time, largely because of the socio-economic demands faced by families and lack of public transport.</P>
    <P>However, despite such gruesome television advertisements, an average of 250 drivers are arrested for drink driving every week, and those are the ones who are caught. Research by the <Col N="128"/>Medical Bureau of Road Safety for 2002 indicated that 90% of those arrested were over the alcohol limit. Apart from the fatalities, approximately 12,000 people are injured in road crashes every year and, of those, 1,500 are seriously injured. We should seriously examine those findings. In terms of those who are seriously injured, we have all met individuals who have been seriously injured and their families whose focus in life has had to shift as a result of a family member suffering a long-term injury. That is what we are talking about in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for road safety and implementing the road safety strategy stretches across four Departments, namely the Departments of Transport; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and Health and Children. Yet there is little evidence that the issue is being taken seriously by the Ministers in those Departments. The truth is that for a long time there was a lethargy at the heart of Government where road safety was quite often perceived to be someone else&rsquo;s responsibility. Who would blame them? If I was the Minister for Transport and I had three other Ministers whom I could blame for inaction, why would I not do that? That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>I welcome Gay Byrne as our road safety supremo and the no nonsense approach he has adopted to date. I hope he continues in this manner and is successful. Hopefully, this new measure will bring a decrease in road carnage and put an end to our being the only state in Europe where road deaths are on the increase.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s handling of this grave issue is so inept that it has been accused of criminal negligence, a damning charge levelled by Eddie Shaw, former chairman of the National Safety Council. Disillusioned, he resigned his post in protest over the coalition&rsquo;s lack of action in tackling road carnage. Sadly, almost 400 people died on our roads last year, a depressing increase on previous years and the worst death toll since 2001 when 411 people were killed. By May of this year, 168 people had already died on our roads. It is sometimes difficult to get the concept of these numbers into our heads. This Chamber has seats for 166 Deputies. If we add just two more, that is the number that died by May this year. This is deplorable.</P>
    <P>Given the North&rsquo;s reduction in road deaths, the lowest since 1952, serious questions must be asked about the situation in the Republic. Despite their milestone achievement, authorities in the North are emphatic that the relatively low toll of 136 fatalities is still far too high. Improving road safety north of the Border is regarded as a major policing priority. In 2006, this priority will benefit from a two-track approach, education backed by robust enforcement. No stretch of the imagination could describe road safety enforcement here as robust. It is patchy, uneven and lacks resources.</P><Col N="129"/>
    <P>According to Garda estimates, one third of all fatal road accidents are drink related. This puts a heavy onus on Government to provide the resources necessary for robust policing and enforcement of drink driving legislation. It goes without saying that many deaths are attributable to driver behaviour, but it is equally true that the behaviour of motorists is influenced by how Government policies are enforced.</P>
    <P>The use of mobile phones in cars should be addressed. While it is good that fire officers and garda&iacute; can use mobile phones while on duty, it is wrong for them to be allowed to use hand-held phones while driving vehicles. It smacks of penny-pinching that a hands-free unit is not supplied to these vehicles to allow them be used safely.</P>
    <P>When I first suggested the use of random breath testing on a radio programme, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport, a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, recriminated me and said it would be unworkable because of constitutional issues. Now, I wonder how minds were changed so quickly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I offer my sympathy to the families of those who have died on our roads over recent years, particularly the families of the 399 people who lost their lives in 2005 and the 185 killed up to mid-June this year. These figures show we need continued action on the issue.</P>
    <P>Despite what previous speakers have said, the tackling of this issue is not down to the Government alone. There are so many stakeholders with regard to the problem of road carnage that the legislation must be taken in the context of a stiff conversation with all of us. When the legislation is passed, it must be seen as an action taken to deal with the matter. It must be seen as having arisen from the concerns expressed by the public, the Garda and all involved. If we accept it in that context, perhaps more people will pay heed to penalty points, to the rules, regulations and laws in place and the efforts made by legislators to ensure we deal with the issue once and for all. If the appropriate funding is put in place with the legislation, it will improve our credibility as legislators and stakeholders.</P>
    <P>The public also has a role to play. People must acknowledge that this legislation and the funding provided are our best effort to ensure deaths on our roads are reduced and people are better informed on road use. Drivers have a direct responsibility and we have a role to play in that context. Previous speakers referred to the need for the provision of driver education in second level schools to ensure the basic rules of the road are taught to pupils going through our educational system. That used to be the case. This need is so important that we need to restore driver education to a prominent position at second level. We must ensure young drivers moving on from there are provided with the best possible instruction from professionals and off-road <Col N="130"/>experience. Instruction tracks should be provided for this throughout the country.</P>
    <P>All these measures are necessary because of the increased volume of traffic on our roads. Our economy has improved significantly and most families now have two, three or four cars, depending on the number of family members who must travel to work. How we deal with the increased volume is an issue that concerns local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have great regard for the road designs implemented by the NRA. Magnificent national road projects that have come to fruition make an enormous difference to moving the volume of traffic on our roads from A to B safely. However, there are issues with regard to the NRA&rsquo;s engagement with local authorities and the delivery of projects of national importance that may have a local nature. For example, I have raised the matter of the newly constructed Piltown-Fiddown bypass several times in the House. There have been seven deaths on that new road, yet the suggestions made to address the issues by the local community through the local authority were largely ignored. Now, after just a few years of use, more millions of taxpayers&rsquo; money will be spent to provide a different system to deal with the 13 right-hand junctions on the road. More attention should be paid to local communities that raise such issues.</P>
    <P>Where the provision of this type of road project has an impact on local communities and roads, we should provide speed ramps, traffic calming measures and all of the modern concepts that lead to greater road safety. Local authorities should receive more funding to ensure urban road networks and housing estates, particularly older estates, can install ramps and traffic calming measures where necessary. We should be mindful of this when building new housing estates, like that in Kilkenny city where a whole new area is being constructed to accommodate up to 15,000 people. In building those new residential areas, the roads into and the road network within the estates should be built with ramps and other traffic control measures in mind so they do not need to be retrofitted. This would represent sound planning and good management by local authorities. Where it falls to Government to fund, we need a proactive method of funding over a number of years. At our clinics we have all received the same complaints of anti-social behaviour and the speed of traffic through estates and cities. Urban management represents a huge problem and yet these matters are not being funded adequately to allow us to remove them from the agenda. They represent serious safety issues. In some constituencies complaints have been made about roads between villages being used as speed tracks. Late at night vehicles are speeding in races with bets wagered as to who will drive fastest between two points on a county road. This activity is absolute madness and needs <Col N="131"/>to be controlled. The Garda needs funding to allow far greater monitoring of the problem and to address it.</P>
    <P>Likewise when managing urban development, inner relief roads and connections to outer roads are extremely important and we need a method of fast-tracking funding and planning in that regard. More often than not it is not the funding but the planning that represents the problem. The planning process is so slow that it fails to deliver the project on time, resulting in years wasted in dealing with the problem. We need to deal with this as an issue relative to road safety. We need to make existing roads safe and ensure safety on roads being constructed.</P>
    <P>Employers are also stakeholders in this matter. My background is in the transport industry, where I employed almost 25 truck drivers. I know the importance of speed control on those trucks. However, I also know how easy it is to defuse the system to allow a driver to drive at whatever speed he or she likes. I have seen too many accidents arise from that process. Employers should be helped to vet their drivers as they come along, to continue to educate them on road networks, new laws, penalty points etc. As we introduce regulations, we need those with a large number of drivers in their employment to pass on the information to them. As was said earlier, part of the problem relates to communication and ensuring the message is implemented as law for the individuals and employers concerned.</P>
    <P>Many transport companies are employing non-Irish nationals. We need to go an extra mile with those non-Irish employees, as they need to understand the road network, the different speed limits and the rules of the road here. It is simple for employers to communicate to those drivers and that should be encouraged. Years ago F&Aacute;S used to give a grant for such courses. While that is no longer the case, it should be encouraged at least. The Bill makes provision to deal with non-Irish drivers who bring their own cars here. On a number of occasions on one roundabout in Kilkenny I have seen cars going around in the wrong direction. We need to continue to make people aware of this problem.</P>
    <P>By comparison with other European countries, we are not up to speed on speed limit and road signage. While the signage is improving we need to increase the pace at which this is happening. Directional and speed limit signs away from the main motorways need major improvement. Local authorities have responsibility to deliver this information to drivers as they go along. Without having a proliferation of signs along such roads, there is a need to improve signage, which would help motorists, particularly those who do not know the roads or elderly people who find it difficult to make their way along the roads at some speed. Addressing this matter requires funding. <Col N="132"/>Funding will drive the Bill and will ultimately deliver results.</P>
    <P>The Garda also has a role to play. The Committee of Public Accounts in its seventh interim report highlighted the issue of speed cameras. The committee&rsquo;s investigation in 2003, 2004 and 2005 found that more than half the images generated could not be used. I am completely in favour of the privatisation of the camera system. However, we need to consider what is best practice and to benchmark that best practice against what is achieved in other countries. When the private operator is appointed &mdash; as quickly as possible, I hope &mdash; we should be able to see real results and to compare those results with what is being achieved in other countries. We should move from that benchmark to continue to improve the standard.</P>
    <P>It is only by doing so and with other concepts to be introduced by the Garda that we will restore credibility to that system and to the Garda itself. I am sure members of the Garda are affected by the failure of that system to work. The Garda is also affected by the fact that nominated drivers are particularly hard to pursue. We have had a poor success rate in identifying the driver of a vehicle within a company. It is a major challenge in the system to chase down those nominated drivers and successfully deliver summonses. Regardless of the system in place people will always find a loophole. We need flexible legislation to ensure we can adapt to the new problems on the road and deal with those who will try to get around the law.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Carey on drink driving. Irish society is willing to move towards zero tolerance of drink driving. Anyone who takes a drink and drives on the road represents a serious problem. The only way to deal with the problem is for society to begin to accept that the Government will move along the European line towards zero tolerance so drinking and driving is not acceptable at any level.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Government to investigate how it might implement prosecutions against those who use drugs and drive. Some people drive having taken prescribed drugs, which is perfectly legal. I am talking about finding a way to deal with those who use all sorts of illegal drugs, from cocaine downwards and then get into a car and drive, which is happening on our roads. I recall tabling a parliamentary question on the matter and I understand there are some complications in this regard. The use of drugs is a serious and growing problem throughout the country. I have no doubt that a growing number of people will chance driving a vehicle under the influence of some form of drug.</P>
    <P>I refer to a number of accidents involving school buses. I recently spoke to a school bus operator and to a private bus operator. The Government needs to take steps to improve standards on the school transport fleet, which is much <Col N="133"/>too old. It has been suggested that recognised dealers rather than the operators of vehicles should be responsible for ensuring a proper maintenance programme is applied to school buses, either when they are brought in for an MOT or examined on other occasions. Independent verification of the maintenance programme operated by large bus operators is also necessary, particularly with regard to the school bus system.</P>
    <P>If we are to require in law that young children wear seat belts on school buses, we must introduce a means of enforcement, for example, the appointment of conductors to travel on school buses. While I am aware this proposal would generate additional costs, I have seen seat belts on school buses which were tied in knots or used to obstruct other children. MOT certificates and buses should also be subject to random checks.</P>
    <P>Bus owners have requested that motorway speed limits for buses be increased to 100 km/h to enhance safety. We should examine any proposals to improve safety made by bus operators. I reiterate that legislation should be sufficiently flexible to allow the Legislature to amend and adapt it if necessary.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points Deputies made regarding the use of mobile telephones. All of us stand accused of taking calls on our mobile telephones while driving. Due to the pressure of modern life, far too often we instinctively answer calls while driving. This practice is common among businessmen and those who do not have hands-free car phone kits installed. I welcome the ban on the use of mobile telephones while driving and believe the introduction of a &euro;2,000 fine for those who break the law will give drivers pause for thought.</P>
    <P>On mandatory breath testing and drink driving, we should consider how we can encourage good behaviour. For example, pubs and hotels should be encouraged to provide a courtesy service for patrons. Members of the Government may not wish to hear my proposal but it should consider waiving VAT or VRT on vehicles specifically used for this purpose because courtesy services contribute to greater road safety. This option should be encouraged in the trade as it would force it to deliver a significant and tangible contribution to road safety. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the time given to me. This is important legislation. Every week we learn from radio, television and newspapers the new death toll on our roads. We are almost hardened to the fact that road traffic deaths will occur. Road traffic fatalities occur on average more than once per day, an unacceptable rate. The only time the problem impacts on the public is when we <Col N="134"/>hear the new monthly toll. Unfortunately, however, statistics do not impact on the group we seek to target, namely, young people. We want to scare young people if necessary and at least make them think twice before they go out at the weekend about the danger that they may not come back or will be involved in a serious road traffic accident. Information on the death toll from road accidents affects only one group, namely, parents such as me.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>As it is 6.45 p.m., I am obliged to call on the Minister to reply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, who, unfortunately, could not be present this evening. I thank Deputies from all sides for an informed debate on an important legislative change to traffic law and road safety. It is evident from the number of debates the House has had on road safety and the series of road traffic Bills it has passed that this issue unites all sides.</P>
    <P>The debate raised many issues and I will endeavour on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf to respond as positively and constructively as possible. The Minister looks forward to working with Opposition Deputies on Committee Stage to consider in detail some of the issues they raised. He has indicated his intention to take an open and constructive approach to amendments Opposition parties may table or issues they may raise.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the importance and urgency associated with this Bill, particularly as regards mandatory alcohol testing and the privatisation of speed cameras. It is important that the Bill is passed and in this context I acknowledge the co-operation of Opposition Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes the overwhelming view of the House that hand held mobile telephone use while driving must be prohibited. I appreciate the recognition by Deputies of the need to establish a flexible legislative framework to enable in-vehicle communication technologies posing particular road safety risks to be regulated in a speedy manner without the need for primary legislation on each occasion. As Minister for the Environment and Local Government on a previous occasion when this issue was discussed, I am delighted the matter is finally being regulated in law.</P>
    <P>Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Shortall expressed reservations concerning the robustness of the provision prohibiting hand held mobile telephone use. They cited the absence in the Bill of a definition of the term &ldquo;driving a vehicle&rdquo; and indicated this omission would likely give rise to motorists challenging prosecutions for this offence. It is important to point out that section 23 provides that, if enacted, the Bill will be construed together with other Road Traffic Acts, all <Col N="135"/>of which should be read together. The words &ldquo;driving&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver&rdquo; are widely used in traffic law and it would be impossible to have road traffic legislation without a reference to &ldquo;driving&rdquo; or to a &ldquo;driver&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;driving&rdquo; is defined in section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. This longstanding definition has passed the test of time with regard to the implementation and enforcement of road traffic law.</P>
    <P>It was suggested the defence concessions provided for in section 3(7) on the use of a hand held mobile telephone are wide open to abuse. The subsection has been drafted so that the use of a hand held telephone would be considered permissible in two circumstances only. The first of these would be to make a call to the Garda or emergency services on numbers prescribed by the Minister. It is intended to prescribe 999 and 112 as these numbers. Calls to these numbers can be traced, including, I understand, calls from &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; mobile telephones. If section 3(7) is invoked as a defence by a person caught by a garda using a hand held mobile telephone, it would be relativity straightforward to establish whether the call was to a prescribed emergency service telephone number.</P>
    <P>The other permitted use of a hand held mobile telephone relates to a genuine emergency. It is recognised that there may be other emergency circumstances in which a driver may need to use a hand held mobile telephone while driving his or her vehicle. However, it will be up to the driver to convince the Garda or the court that the use related to a genuine emergency. These defence provisions are reasonable and are not easily open to abuse. We all had the experience in recent weeks of ensuring that reasonable defences were available to us. Hands free mobile telephone use involving bluetooth telephones will not come within the scope of the prohibition provided for in subsection (1) of section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>An exemption will be provided to drivers of Garda vehicles, ambulances and fire tenders under strictly controlled circumstances. The exemption will only be available where the driver is acting in the course of his or her duties. While use of a hand held telephone would not generally arise, it is prudent to provide an exemption to providers of these independent and important services.</P>
    <P>I note the proposal to privatise the operation of speed cameras has been welcomed overall, although a number of Deputies have expressed concerns about various aspects of this initiative. The purpose of the privatisation initiative is to enhance overall road safety and help reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries on our roads. The purpose of deploying cameras is to encourage road users to drive within the speed limit, specifically at locations where there is a known speed related danger of crashes. It has been accepted that the Garda cannot operate a <Col N="136"/>system of fixed and mobile cameras without a significant private sector engagement and the target of 11.1 million vehicles to be checked for speeding annually as outlined in the road safety strategy cannot be achieved without privatisation. I assure the House the central focus of this initiative is on saving lives rather than earning revenue. There will be no link between the fees paid to the private operator and the number of detections. Decisions on the locations of cameras will reflect experience of speed related collisions and evidence of a history of speeding. A combination of fixed and mobile cameras will operate in target areas. The private operator will have no role in the selection of the camera sites. The Bill addresses the specific parameters required to facilitate the engagement of a private sector operator. The Government is fully committed to the establishment of strict criteria which will be applied in respect of the determination of the locations and the operational parameters for the engagement of the private sector in this area. I assure the House this project will be under the control of the Garda at both strategic and operational levels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall raised an issue in regard to the blood alcohol limits in this and other states. In Ireland, an 80 milligram limit is strictly applied. The lower blood limits applied in some countries do not always attract equally strict penalties. Statistics indicate that those being detected for drink driving have a blood alcohol level well in excess of the legal limit. Some 85% of blood and urine specimens and 80% of breath specimens analysed in 2004 by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety were above the alcohol limit for driving. It is even more worrying that more than half of those who failed blood or urine tests and almost one third of those who failed breath tests had alcohol contents of at least twice the legal limit. The limit, therefore, is being ignored by a core number of drivers who simply refuse to obey the law. I assure the House that the question of reviewing the limit will be kept under review. However, the priority at present is to increase the chances of being breathalysed through the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has asked officials to examine the concept of introducing lower blood alcohol limits for learner drivers, as is the practice in some other jurisdictions. The introduction of such a measure would require an in-depth examination of legal issues and widespread consultation. It is not possible to introduce such a measure in this Bill within the given timeframe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowley and others proposed that the Bill be amended so that a driver involved in a road traffic accident shall be required to undergo a mandatory test for alcohol or drugs. The Road Traffic Acts already provide that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may require a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle to provide a <Col N="137"/>preliminary breath specimen where the vehicle is involved in a road collision or where a garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed or forms the opinion that the person has consumed alcohol. The purpose of preliminary roadside breath testing is to provide the garda&iacute; with a facility to assist them in determining whether a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle has consumed alcohol. The Road Traffic Acts provide that a person may be arrested for a drink driving offence without recourse to a preliminary breath test.</P>
    <P>There may be circumstances, especially in the context of a road collision, where it may not be possible for a member of the Garda to require a person who is unconscious or injured to submit to a preliminary breath test. Under the Road Traffic Acts, garda&iacute; may place an obligation on a person to provide a blood or urine sample in a hospital. This applies where an event occurs involving a vehicle which results in a person being injured or a person claiming or appearing to have been injured, where the person is admitted to or attends a hospital and where a garda is of the opinion that at the time of the event the person had consumed an intoxicant. An intoxicant includes alcohol and drugs or any combination of alcohol and drugs. Garda discretion in the use of preliminary roadside tests is an integral element of the enforcement provisions in legislation applying to drink driving.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell and Shortall have asked for clarification on the operation of mandatory alcohol testing. Drinking and driving in Ireland is recognised as one of the most serious contributory factors in road collisions and evidence shows that drink driving is increasing. There is widespread acceptance among responsible motorists and society as a whole that driving under the influence of alcohol is potentially dangerous. Despite extensive publicity and targeted campaigns, some drivers are not willing to change their behaviour. The numbers of deaths on our roads will not decrease unless strong legislative measures are taken and enforced to bring about attitude change. The primary target of the road safety strategy commits the Government to the introduction of a form of roadside breath testing which would address in a positive way the problem of drinking and driving. The introduction of a scheme has been the subject of extensive consultation and legal advice.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Section 4 outlines the scheme for roadside alcohol testing, known as mandatory alcohol testing, and the legal basis for the establishment and operation of Garda checkpoints. Mandatory alcohol tests can only be pursued on the specific written authorisation of a garda officer not below the rank of inspector. That authorisation must be in writing and must clearly establish the place, date and the hours between which it may be operated. When setting up a checkpoint, there is a need for <Col N="138"/>absolute transparency in procedures and the wording of this section was drafted very carefully with that in mind after widespread consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General to find the correct balance and proportionality. There is a need for flexibility with regard to the timing and locations of checkpoints. The current wording allows necessary operational flexibility for the Garda to stop and start checkpoint activities according to traffic volume and other considerations. The Garda Commissioner will establish guidelines to assist and inform all members of the force in carrying out their roles in respect of the operation of tests.</P>
    <P>Mandatory alcohol testing in countries where it is not necessary to form an opinion as to whether alcohol has been consumed has proved to be an enforcement tool capable of changing attitudes towards drinking and driving. The provision on testing aims to give a clear and consistent message to drivers that drink driving is a dangerous and unacceptable activity. Random checks of vehicles are highly effective when combined with the right to breathalyse and high visibility and can reduce drink driving fatalities by between one third and one half. The introduction of a new system, combined with publicity and rigorous enforcement, will enhance the deterrents to drink driving and bring about the changes in attitude and behaviour needed to reduce the number of fatalities on our roads.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for this constructive debate. The Minister for Transport sends his apologies and looks forward to engaging with Members on Committee Stage.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies Fiona O&rsquo;Malley and Kitt. I listened with interest to the debate last night. It is topical because waste management has become a major global issue in recent years. My role is not to criticise the Green Party. In fact, although it is not popular to do so, I commend it for the work it did in this area. Most mainstream parties now address the idea of saving the environment.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s waste management policies are working. We are changing from a throwaway society and recycling rates are increasing rapidly. It is interesting to read the waste management benchmarking study recently published by Forf&aacute;s. It makes for interesting reading when one considers the advances made in recent years. When this Government took office in 1997 the recycling rate was 9%. This increased to 34% by 2004 so we are well on the way to meeting the national target of 35% in 2013. We are eight years ahead of schedule, a considerable step forward.</P>
    <P>Modern, environmentally safe methods are being introduced for the final disposal of non-recyclable materials. Concerted enforcement seeks to wipe out illegal waste activity. Much progress has been made over the past 18 months. Illegal dumping, where certain sections of society approached householders and illegally dumped their waste, was a concern. The key to the <Col N="142"/>Government&rsquo;s policy is recognition that waste is, literally, a waste of resources that costs us twice. As well as the financial and environmental costs of disposing of it, we lose the value of the materials.</P>
    <P>Ireland is becoming a nation that recycles. The role of schools and parents must be recognised. Teenagers are far more conscious of the environment than are middle-aged and older people. Ireland is especially successful on packaging waste, the recovery rate of which is 57%. This exceeds the EU target of 50% by 2005. Commercial premises are obliged to segregate at source and present certain specified waste material for recovery, leading to what is effectively a ban on these materials for landfill.</P>
    <P>Carlow County Council has provided resources for a landfill extension but we cannot continue this indefinitely. We must bite the bullet and consider thermal treatment. I have been in favour of it for a long time. As we continue to reduce, reuse and recycle the amount of residual product will be small. Nevertheless, landfills will be necessary.</P>
    <P>The majority of householders have separate bin collections for recyclables. Local authorities provide brown bins for kerbside collection of household organic waste. A move to pay per use domestic charges rewards those who recycle more. The vast majority of householders recycle and I am told recycling centres are the new centre for social gossip on Saturday afternoons. They are becoming far busier at weekends, leading to traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>The Government published its national strategy on biodegradable waste in April 2006, a document grounded in the integrated waste management approach. It sets out measures by which Ireland will achieve 80% diversion of biodegradable waste, 1.8 million tonnes, from landfill by 2016. For the first time in a national waste management strategy document, targets have been set for waste prevention and minimisation. Recycling through organic treatment is a major component of the plan. We are also developing safe environmentally friendly infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Not all waste can be recycled. The most environmentally progressive of our EU partners rely on thermal treatment despite high recycling rates. Of the benchmarked countries in the Forf&aacute;s report, only New Zealand has no thermal treatment plants. Modern incinerators are subject to the most stringent controls and, as a member of Carlow County Council I visited a number of these plants in operation in France, Germany and Denmark. A number of Irish facilities are at the planning and licensing process. Landfill will be used for residual waste but remains critical until the rest of the infrastructure is in place. We have changed from having many low quality landfills to fewer landfills operating to the highest environmental standards. In the past landfills did not have to be licensed and many farmers used quarries. One could not imagine the type of <Col N="143"/>material contained in these dumps. Greencore has closed down two of its factories over the past two years. From speaking to former workers, I am aware that workers used landfill for hazardous and chemical waste. This will take much money and time to rectify. I commend the Minister for his work in this area.</P>

	<P>I came in yesterday evening to listen to the Green Party debate this important strategic issue. I was sadly disappointed. I wasted my time. What I heard was one member of the Green Party after another kick their constituency colleagues around the place. Deputy Gormley started with his colleague, the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Was Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s output?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>No. I am speaking about the Green Party.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are they?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Would they mind not interrupting me until I make my points?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister kept interrupting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>We were treated to a kicking of local constituency colleagues. I am sorry that the people are not in the Gallery today because I would have expected&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>They are.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;such a short time from a general election, that this is the opportunity for the Green Party to put its cards on the table, to announce its policies on these important issues and to tell its constituents who were in the Gallery exactly how it will deal with this critical waste problem. The Green Party recognises it as a critical waste problem but not one of them took the opportunity to discuss the Canadian Guelph theory and process. They did not even bother to address their own motion because they, and particularly Deputy Gormley, were so keen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Malley was not listening.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, please address your remarks through the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am. Deputy Gormley, in particular, was playing to the Gallery&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Here is my speech.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which was full of his constituents. I am sorry that those constituents are <Col N="144"/>not present to hear what he would do were he in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry Deputy McDowell is not here.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but this is the problem with the policies of the Green Party, which does not finish its sentences. They tell us the problem, which we all recognise, and what we all need to do, but they fail to deal with the responsibility of the response. They have never yet been in Government and they will be a long time waiting for office because they do not live in the real world dealing honestly and responsibly with the issue.</P>
    <P>It is an important issue and I am grateful to the Green Party for highlighting and giving us the opportunity to discuss this Forf&aacute;s report. One point I have taken from that report is the progress Ireland has made. The Minister stated in his speech yesterday that we are on the right road. The road is not finished, but clearly Ireland has made enormous improvements. Deputy Nolan spoke about this. Before the Government took office in 1997 recycling rates were at an atrocious level of 9%. They are now at 33%.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the people, not the Government, who solved that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agreed targets for 2016 of 35% which we have almost reached.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the recycling happening?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be nice of them to applaud success when it is achieved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are they recycling the glass and paper?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with anybody who states that is not enough but let us try to get as much done as we can. Part of the reason that recycling efforts have been taken up so well in Ireland, to which Deputy Nolan also alluded, and which also has much to do with efforts such as programmes in schools, is undoubtedly the bring centres. My area of Glasthule has a new facility which means it is so much easier for people to recycle. We all are easily able to recycle because it is as convenient as taking rubbish with you for disposal and recycling when going to the shops or wherever.</P>
    <P>There is another glaring point in this Forf&aacute;s report. It clearly sets out the infrastructural deficit in terms of waste management. This is another area where I take issue with the Green Party. On the energy side, it continuously tells us how good other countries like Denmark are in terms of generation of wind power, renewable energy and the <Col N="145"/>like, but it fails to be honest about it and state such countries also use nuclear power. Equally, Flanders is sited as an example and I agree it is one to which we all should aspire.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley want that as well? She is her Daddy&rsquo;s daughter all right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Dessie wanted it. Now Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley wants it as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>In Flanders, which is the ideal to which we all aspire, the recycling rate has reached an incredible 70%. Would we not all like that in Ireland? Flanders&rsquo; waste recovery to energy rate is 26% and its disposal rate is a mere 4%.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>They are able to do this because they have in place the waste management infrastructure, which includes incineration &mdash; the Green Party must get its head out of the clouds and have its policy rooted in the real world. We need to be honest about this. It is part of how Ireland will deal, not only with its waste problem but equally with helping energy generation. It is something we should be embracing.</P>
    <P>Because the Green Party has never had the responsibility of office, it has never had to nail its colours to the mast. I am sorry the people from Ringsend are not here because they deserve an honest reply in response and a policy from their public representatives. That is why, to finish the sentence for the Green Party, they might tell the people what they will do and how they will do it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the closest I have seen up the Green Party come to a policy is in terms of zero waste.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Towards zero.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard them state that it is possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We never said that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible. A policy rooted in such a scenario is not dealing with the real world. The pages that all the Deputies produced last night to help with their speeches is waste generated. I agree it can be recycled but the recycling system wastes energy too. This notion of zero waste is an utter fallacy. I am sure Fine Gael and the Labour Party are quite anxious about this. We must get the Green Party grounded in real policies.</P>
    <P>I have tremendous regard for my colleague on the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan. We work well together on energy, on which, by and large, the Green Party has a sensible policy, <Col N="146"/>but it needs to get into the real world with some of its other policies. It is not behaving as if it is a real party with real policies in that sense.</P>
    <P>The Green Party has always gone into the politics of the negative. I will not list and quote statistics about what the Government has done here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Malley does not know them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because they have been recited previously. We have a good track record.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Damn statistics.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government did nothing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody will deny there are problems but if everybody in this House were honest, they would agree that some type of energy waste recovery facility is required and will be delivered in this country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Burn, baby, burn.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>We should all back it because the alternative, as we all know, is noxious, poisonous landfill. I was watching on television quite recently the opening of a new landfill site in Galway.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Where does the toxic ash go?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Malley without interruption please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same day a planning application had gone in to extend the Indaver facility in Meath. The television reporter stated he knew which place he would like to live next to. People, particularly from the Green Party, are most dishonest about emissions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is Deputy McDowell?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>According to well known statistics, what happens in back gardens is far more noxious.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Spurious.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, people burn stuff in back gardens. Certainly, living near a thermal treatment facility is much safer than living beside a landfill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Until it malfunctions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the route we should go. Landfill does not work and we need to minimise it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with all Deputy <Col N="147"/>Fiona O&rsquo;Malley said. No party here has a monopoly in this area. My contribution is based on facts because the Government has produced good results. I welcome the opportunity to demonstrate how environmentally aware are the Government&rsquo;s policies.</P>
    <P>More than anything else, this debate affords the public the opportunity to see clearly that environmental issues are not the preserve of an individual party. Over the past nine years, and in less time in some cases, Fianna F&aacute;il, with its partner in Government, has implemented a raft of successful environment initiatives that are measurable in their effects. Over its period in office, the Government has made key decisions concerning the environment and renewable energy which will serve to protect our environment for future generations, and that is what we are about.</P>
    <P>These decisions have been made at a time of unprecedented growth in our economy, which most Members have acknowledged in the debate. Less than a decade ago, we recycled less than 10% of our municipal waste but, by 2004, this had climbed to 34%, approaching the EU average, at a time when the workforce increased dramatically. How does this square with the Opposition&rsquo;s contention that the Government has failed to divert waste from landfill?</P>
    <P>We have almost reached our 2013 national recycling target of 35% while we have been particularly successful in recycling packaging waste. Between 1998 and 2004, the number of bring banks and recycling centres almost doubled. The Government has committed more than &euro;90 million to recycling and recovery facilities since 2003 and the number of facilities has continually increased as a result. The majority of households have separate bin collections for recyclables and local authorities are increasingly providing brown bins for the kerbside collection of household organic waste. In my constituency, South Dublin County Council received a huge response from the public to the provision of home compost bins.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s adoption of the polluter pays principle rewards those who recycle. Hundreds of thousands of people share my view that recycling and other environmental activities are positive acts of citizenship. In shaping our polices, we have been meeting the ever growing demands of citizens and consumers for the Government to enact creative policies and legislation that rewards modes of living that are sustainable environmentally. In 1997, only 70,000 homes had kerbside collection. By 2003, this figure had increased to more than 506,000 and the number is set to increase rapidly.</P>
    <P>The Government is finalising proposals for a new scheme to deal with scrap cars and other vehicles so that they can be disposed of responsibly and in a sustainable way. Fianna F&aacute;il and its Government partner took the decision to place a <Col N="148"/>levy on plastic bags. Does the Green Party opposite recall a time when plastic lay strewn across the countryside along roadsides and in fields?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We proposed a levy in 1994.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Millions of plastic bags were land filled for years and the levy has reduced plastic bag use by more than 90%.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We thank the Government for the levy, which we proposed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not recognised in the motion. The levy has produced its own income stream, which in itself has succeeded in funding a host of other environmental initiatives. The Government took radical action regarding the working environment of the individual, not reactively but proactively, by banning smoking in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Fianna F&aacute;il, with its partner in Government, has demonstrated itself to be the sensible and practical Irish clean environment party, implementing creative and imaginative policies which aim to care for the environment and which aim to bring about sustainable changes in attitudes. Crucially, we are doing this in a way that is consistent with our growth and development as a nation and as a developing economy. When faced with the choice, I am confident that citizens will choose those who will safeguard our future both economically and environmentally.</P>
    <P>Almost 75% of the waste discarded at home or in the workplace is biodegradable. Traditionally, the great bulk of this waste has gone to landfill. In 1998 only 11% of biodegradable waste was recycled but, by 2004, 33% of biodegradable municipal waste was being recycled. This was achieved at a time the economy was expanding. Ireland must meet a target of 80% by 2016 and the Government, in its national strategy on biodegradable waste published by my colleague, shows the way to achieve this without sacrificing our living standards, quality of life or the employment prospects for future generations. It is gradually becoming clear that the Government&rsquo;s environment policies are based on the principle of integrated waste management, which prioritises waste prevention and minimisation followed by reuse and recycling, with landfill as the final resort. Having made substantial progress on the latter two, we must continue to strive to make progress on the prevention and minimisation of waste.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government about the strong inconsistency of those who, on the one hand, praise the public for engaging in environmentally aware behaviour such as recycling, yet on the other, criticise the Government for its record in this regard. A glance at the facts highlights commitment, resolve and real results on the part of the Government. For example, construction and <Col N="149"/>demolition waste recycling in 2004 reached 84%, just below the target set for 2013. Despite strong criticism from some quarters regarding the electrical waste recycling scheme, Ireland was one of only three countries to implement the EU directive fully and on time last August. In the period to the end of February, almost 15,000 tonnes of this waste was collected for recycling.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley, regarding the Green Party&rsquo;s position on incineration. The party has left itself exposed as inconsistent and opportunistic in this debate. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated it is clear the Green Party environment Minister in Germany adopted a much more honest and responsible approach in pursuing a policy framework that had incineration with energy recovery as a core principle. Before he left office, he introduced severe restrictions on the use of landfill. How many more landfills does the Green Party want constructed throughout the State? The party has not given leadership on this issue and, while there has been a convergence of views on renewable energy, an open and honest debate is needed in this area.</P>
    <P>The European Union is at the leading edge in this field. It should be commended on having among its ranks a number of the world&rsquo;s most environmentally advanced countries</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>They are big into nuclear power.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>They can combine high rates of recycling with safe and effective use of thermal treatment. This is the way forward. It is not right that we should dump our waste on our EU neighbours or on future generations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will still have to use landfill. Where will the ash go?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Green Party is given an opportunity to implement its policies, it will force us to continue to use the least environmentally friendly way of dealing with waste.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who said the way forward is to use state-of-the-art incinerators to produce electricity or district heating. This is much preferable to burying our waste.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will still have to use landfill. Where will the ash go?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>If we do not pursue an intelligent debate on those issues, on which we must face up to hard questions, we will have buried our heads in the sand. This important debate is welcome. Waste management will be a key issue and we owe to our children and future generations to debate it in an honest and open way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="150"/>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The incineration issue is centre stage and we should, like our colleagues in the European Union, face up to it and address it properly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Including Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Gilmore. It is the stated policy of the elected members of Dublin City Council, as set out in the Dublin City Development Plan 2005-2011, to oppose the siting of an incinerator on the Poolbeg Peninsula, while it is the stated policy of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats to build an incinerator on the peninsula, despite what their representatives and candidates in the local area may claim. The Government parties solved this problem by removing all relevant powers from the elected representatives of the people on Dublin City Council and vesting them in civil servants instead. Ministerial diktat runs the waste policy of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government claimed last night in the House and on RTE radio earlier, that CHP will be undertaken in Poolbeg. He asserted there would not be incineration and certainly not a mass burn incinerator. What, a normal member of the community not fluent in the jargon of waste management might ask, does CHP mean? CHP stands for combined heat and power. CHP means a mass burn incinerator that extracts both electricity and heat from the incineration process. Does that sound familiar? Is that supposed to be okay? As Shakespeare, the Bard, might have said today: &ldquo;That which we call an incinerator; by any other name would smell as foul&rdquo;. Officials of Dublin City Council still call this an incinerator. They are not under the cosh of the Progressive Democrats and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues are using the language of public relations. Next, he will tell Members that it is not a tax hike, it is a revenue enhancement.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the Green Party for tabling this motion and for giving the many Opposition Members of this House who have been vocal on the matter a chance to voice their opinions. Several Government Members will also be keen to make statements. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, expressed his personal preference many times that no incinerator be located in Wicklow. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who is not in the House and presumably will not enter the Chamber this evening, has given similar promises regarding the proposed Poolbeg incinerator, including, as Deputy Gormley noted yesterday, in his election literature.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Minister recently issued a leaflet entitled, Michael McDowell is opposed to Dublin City Council&rsquo;s mass burn incinerator at Poolbeg. <Col N="151"/>Therefore, if he has the courage of his convictions, I look forward to seeing him cross the floor this evening to vote in accordance with the documentation with which he has flooded the constituency of Dublin South-East.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I wish to declare an interest. I represent the constituency of Dublin South-East and I live less than 500 m from the proposed location of the incinerator. There are valid and logical reasons to oppose the siting of an incinerator at Poolbeg and yesterday&rsquo;s contributions covered many of them. I will draw attention to some specific aspects which I believe are important, as well as introducing some new information to the record.</P>
    <P>The choice of Poolbeg is the first in a series of bizarre and illogical decisions made by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Poolbeg is at the heart of one of the city&rsquo;s most valuable assets, namely, Dublin Bay. The bay is not simply an economic asset in terms of the passenger and freight shipping facilities it provides. It is also a major recreational facility for those living in the city. The proposed S2S, or Sutton to Sandycove promenade, will greatly improve this facility. This is the most populated bay on the island.</P>
    <P>Hence, it is bizarre to introduce an enormous industrial plant dedicated to burning waste of all types in the middle of the most scenic part of the city. While the Poolbeg peninsula has long been left idle, the opportunity now presents itself to use it for the benefit of all citizens. The Progressive Democrats have pointed this out in wonderfully graphic literature. They have flooded the constituency with a Sydney, Australia-like image of what that part of the bay could look like. Tonight however, as Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley informed the House, they will vote for the destruction of that possibility by putting an incinerator at its heart.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention my colleagues, Councillors Kevin Humphries and Dermot Lacey, who are four-square behind me and the Labour group on Dublin City Council in respect of this issue.</P>
    <P>According to figures released by Dublin City Council officials, 600,000 tonnes of waste will be required to fuel the incinerator each year. This amounts to 1,644 tonnes per day. City officials already accept that at least 140 20-tonne trucks will be obliged to travel through the area each day, as well as an unidentified number, possibly as high as 240, according to the assistant city manager, of smaller bin lorries. More trucks will be required to transport the bottom ash, that is, the residue left over from incineration, back out of the incinerator plant, adding at least 30% to the volume of truck movements.</P>
    <P>This is in addition to the already chronic traffic problem afflicting the area, with significant volumes of traffic passing along Strand Road, as well <Col N="152"/>as trucks travelling to and from the port and local building sites. The officials claim that some of the trucks will use the port tunnel. Even if this is the case &mdash; they admit that at most, less than half will use the tunnel &mdash; the effect on the area will be enormous. There will be dust, dirt, smells and traffic jams.</P>
    <P>While my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, is more than capable of expanding on this issue, I suggest that incineration in its present form is now an outdated technology. Many European countries have stopped building new incinerator plants to deal with waste and are concentrating on combined mechanical and biological treatments and large-scale recycling. Historically, recycling in this country has been neglected and recycling on any significant scale has only taken place in recent years. However, there is a serious problem with the Government&rsquo;s basic approach to recycling. For example, no present scheme makes it financially worthwhile for a commercial company to recycle extensively. Companies do not engage in waste reduction in a broad sense because of the associated opportunity cost.</P>
    <P>The opportunity cost of not recycling or reducing must be increased greatly. If companies found it more economical to recycle than to simply feed waste into the system, one can be sure that every company in the state would so do. Why can rational market forces not be harnessed to achieve an outcome desired by all, instead of ignoring the market and extolling the motivation of companies while allowing them to dump their waste, which is in effect what is happening? The Labour Party believes it is time for the Government to properly incentivise recycling across the entire spectrum of society, not simply among domestic households.</P>
    <P>Our existing landfill systems also leave much to be desired. The days of the dump are long gone. Other European countries intensively manage their landfills and we must do the same. I will leave the more detailed examination of incineration and the other available options to my colleague, Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    <P>The particular project that has been mentioned in this motion, namely, the proposed incinerator at Poolbeg, is not quite as cut and dried as it may seem. There are anomalies in the claims made by officials in the tendering and procurement processes and in the manner in which the entire plan has been pushed through from the outset.</P>
    <P>Mr. Joe McCarthy, a name which makes officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government quake in their boots as he was one of those who exposed the e-voting machines scandal, recently produced a report on the process, based on what little information he could extract from the Minister and his officials. It is recommended reading for anyone interested in how not to manage a large-scale infrastructural project.</P><Col N="153"/>
    <P Just="Left">I wish to address several specific aspects of the project that serve as exemplars of how badly managed it has been thus far. The Waste Management (Planning) Regulations 1997 require a waste management plan to include systems to monitor &ldquo;before, during and after&rdquo; any changes made by the plan. Chapter 11.3.2. of the waste management plan agreed by the elected members of Dublin City Council requires city officials to record such statistics. However, they will not make such information available to the public and it appears they do not have the information. Starting a project without knowing one&rsquo;s starting point is not simply foolish, it is negligent.</P>
    <P>The technical model used to rationalise the decision to build an incinerator at Poolbeg was valid for the period from 1997 to 2011. Only five years remain until the end of this model&rsquo;s lifespan and I find it extremely unlikely that any incinerator will be built and functioning within that timeframe. Therefore, we will be building for a future which we have not even tried to envisage. Again, this is not simply foolish, it is also negligent.</P>
    <P>The cost model assumptions involved in the economic rationale for the incinerator are equally outdated. For example, while the interest rates used in the model for the process of construction were calculated at 6.5%, the current European Central Bank rate is 3.75%. The original plan costed the plant at &euro;146 million and the technical model uses the same cost. The siting report, used to determine the premium location, uses a cost of &euro;127 million, while the Forf&aacute;s review of 2001 refers to a cost of &euro;160 million.</P>
    <P>However, Mazars Consultants, which provides costings estimates for large-scale projects, estimates that an incinerator of smaller capacity than that proposed in Dublin would cost &euro;200 million. Must I mention the Dublin Port tunnel to provide the House with a litany of miscalculations in respect of costs?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Which number is real? Are any of the figures which I have just quoted real? How can the city&rsquo;s officials use two different costings, while central Government has a third? This is not just foolish, it is negligent to the point of being criminally so.</P>
    <P>Costs such as for the removal of the residue ash, baling, CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions under carbon trading per the Kyoto Protocol which is another cost, unsold heat from the plant, and the removal of toxic ash from the system were ignored by city officials in their calculations on this project. The cost of these four elements alone is approximately &euro;45 million per year. They have been completely ignored in all calculations and data we were able to get our hands on. This is not just foolish, it is negligent.</P>
    <P>City officials also recently admitted they have already spent &euro;10 million on this proposal for an <Col N="154"/>incinerator. Without a planning application even lodged, it seems like a significant output for a dodgy plan. Fees have flown out to consultants left, right and centre. I quote the words of my party leader, &ldquo;delighted and touched&rdquo;. The consultants were delighted, we were touched heavily and it seems it could happen again. It appears the mathematics required to cost the plant properly are missing, but those for calculating the consultants&rsquo; fees are quite in order. This is not just foolish, it is negligent.</P>
    <P>I could continue, but I have used up my time. Whatever about the theological arguments for and against incineration, and the merits and demerits of the methods proposed to deal with what is clearly a waste problem, will the Government please get this right? We had electronic voting machines and the port tunnel. We do not need the incompetence of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats to compound what is wrong environmental policy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague, Deputy Quinn, in his devastating critique of the proposal to locate an incinerator in the Poolbeg Peninsula. In recent years we were led to believe that the issue of this incinerator in Poolbeg was the subject of a titanic struggle at Cabinet and that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was blocking the publication of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill until he managed to get the Poolbeg incinerator excised from it.</P>
    <P>The Bill was published, I spent all day working on Committee Stage, and it provides for incinerators. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government states Poolbeg is not included. However, the only reason it will not be included is because the planning application will have been made before the Bill is enacted and commenced. In other words, the success of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in having the Poolbeg incinerator removed from the Bill to fast-track infrastructure projects, including incinerators, is only because it will be fast-tracked even faster than the fast-tracking Bill would have permitted.</P>
    <P>This Government certainly changed many aspects of waste management. By the time of the next election it will have had ten years in power and it will have fundamentally changed the way in which waste is managed, but not necessarily for the better. It will have changed it from being a public service to a private business. When the Government came into office admittedly the way in which waste was managed was not acceptable from an environmental point of view, but it was a public service mainly operated by local authorities and universally delivered.</P>
    <P>Two thirds of the waste collection services are now in private hands as is much of the waste infrastructure. The proposed incinerators will be privately developed as will many new landfills. <Col N="155"/>Waste has become the new means of making money in Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure. One of the most immediate requirements is for legislation to regulate the operation of the private waste industry from collection through to the end product.</P>
    <P>The Government also changed the legislation governing waste management. It took waste management out of the democratic domain and made the entire legislative framework quite undemocratic. The making of waste management plans is now a managerial function in local authorities. The setting of waste charges in local authorities is now a managerial function and is no longer a function of the elected members. It has gone further than that. It set down in legislation what is almost a diktat, a direction which must be followed by local authority managers in drawing up waste management plans.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Over the past nine years, the Government established a framework and infrastructure for waste management for the next 20 to 25 years. Incineration is at the heart of that. One of the first acts of the present Government after its election in 1997 was to require that waste management plans be drawn up on a regional basis rather than on a county basis. The rationale was that each of those regions would have an incinerator. The regions were the catchment for the incinerator.</P>
    <P>On leaving office, this Government will leave behind a waste management legacy which will be quite difficult to unravel and put right. It will require a change in legislation, regulation of the private waste management industry established under the present Government, and a move to a different way of dealing with waste rather than the way the present Government has made incineration the centre of the strategy from which everything else flows. The collection system is predicated on incineration.</P>
    <P>It would have been far better if the Government had concentrated on investment in building up a recycling infrastructure which would have treated waste as a resource rather than a problem which must be disposed of. It will certainly leave behind a major mess which will be an enormous challenge to the next Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies Cowley, Finian McGrath and McHugh.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to support this motion on recycling and waste management. One of my main difficulties with a debate on recycling and waste management strategy is that all other alternatives were not tried first and our official policy is incineration. We spend &euro;60 million to &euro;90 million building incinerators. This in turn will encourage us to produce waste to keep feeding the incinerators. They are built at high cost and will not be left lying idle. That is a major difficulty. It encourages bad practice.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="156"/>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>They must be fed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. We will not build a structure for &euro;60 million or &euro;90 million and leave it sitting idle. This is the major difficulty we have. When people are applying for planning permission for such incinerators, they are afraid or almost ashamed to call them incinerators. They want to call them power-producing plants or plants that will link into the ESB grid. The people of Monaghan find themselves in a catch-22 situation in that an incinerator is being built although planning permission was sought for a power plant. There was no reference to an incinerator in the application to the county council. The case is to go before An Bord Plean&aacute;la next week and it will be interesting to see how it develops.</P>
    <P>One reason incinerators are referred to as power plants is to take one&rsquo;s eye off the health hazards associated with incinerators. Whether we like it, incinerators produce dioxins, which are carcinogenic. This is a major difficulty and we will have to address it. Nobody has convinced me or produced evidence that incinerators do not produce dioxins and are not carcinogenic.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the proposed incinerator in north Monaghan, which is to be in an area with very poor road access. The amount of additional traffic that would be generated on the rural roads defies logic.</P>
    <P>There is now a recycling ethos. It is not just a matter of picking up cans but of stimulating the environmental consciousness of society. We have started on this journey and we should continue to do so. We should encourage young and old alike to develop better policies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, support this motion. The Green Party has done us a great service by tabling it. There is a great need for leadership on this issue and I do not feel the Government has provided it.</P>
    <P>Communities are well capable of doing what is required if they are given direction and support. We have seen that communities in rural areas in which water schemes were not available addressed the matter themselves. The necessary Government support has not been evident.</P>
    <P>Incineration is taking the lazy man&rsquo;s option and not facing up to the possibilities of reducing waste, reusing and recycling. The coming generation will be much more able to deal with these issues than we have been. The future bodes well but we must ensure we preserve the environment for our children, who will make a better fist of things than we did.</P>
    <P>There is a rush towards privatisation. The Government has been abdicating responsibility to do what is necessary. Local authorities are run by unelected people. In Mayo, for instance, all the councillors are in favour of retaining public responsibility for the disposal of waste, yet there <Col N="157"/>is a move towards privatisation just because the council is supposedly losing money. One wonders about this given that the private sector can make a profit from waste disposal. There is therefore something wrong.</P>
    <P>We cannot abdicate responsibility for the support of older people. The State has done so in respect of private nursing homes and the same is happening in regard to waste disposal. There is a move towards big business and we are told the future lies in helping people to make a bob.</P>
    <P>The people of Ringaskiddy made a decision that an incinerator was not for them. The local authority made the same decision, as did the inspector of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but it was overruled on foot of Government policy. If one put the matter to a referendum, one would find that people are much more in favour of recycling than incineration. They have proven they are capable of recycling and will do so if they get the chance.</P>

It was an absolutely disgraceful personal attack.</P>

	<P>It is very important that this issue is raised because it is not acceptable to any Deputy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Green Party on putting forward sensible solutions to the crisis that exists. I challenge the Minister on his record in dealing with this matter. He needs to wake up and deal with it in a progressive, environmentally sound and healthy way. He conned the taxpayers regarding the bin tax issue and is now conning them with the so-called waste management strategy. The vast majority of people are way ahead of the Minister regarding recycling. He is guilty of lengthy delays in rolling out planned infrastructure and there are continual increases in waste generation due to the growing population and nature of the economy.</P>
    <P>Let me state what is happening in Fairview Park following the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel. Yesterday at 10.25 a.m. I entered the tunnel site at Fairview following calls from local residents and saw at first hand the dumping of contaminated clay. I saw clay littered with metal, plastic, blood-soiled sheets and syringes. This is not the clean topsoil that was promised. I challenge the Minister on the waste crisis and the associated serious health and safety issues. What will we do about Fairview Park? What kind of clay and waste is the Minister sending down to Mountmellick? These are serious questions. The <Col N="158"/>Minister needs to wake up regarding the tunnel waste.</P>
    <P>As of today, there are 261 damaged homes in the Marino, Fairview, Drumcondra and Santry areas, although residents were told before the construction of Dublin Port tunnel that this would never happen. I have received 117 complaints from residents outside the 30 m zone. The disgraceful damage to people&rsquo;s homes is a shame and I urge immediate action and compensation for all the affected families on the north side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I deplore the Government&rsquo;s failure to introduce regulations under the Waste Management Act 1996 to give effect to the producer responsibility obligations to promote the placing on the market of reusable, recyclable and biodegradable products. I compliment the civic-mindedness of citizens who are already recycling. I challenge the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the hypocrisy of the Government and I challenge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the fact that incineration costs are significantly higher than the costs estimated by the Government. Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform support the Government&rsquo;s policy or is the rich southside boy allowed, once again, to throw his toys out of the pram and get away with his hypocrisy on incineration? I challenge all members of the Cabinet in this regard.</P>
    <P>I support the motion, which sets out a sensible plan and way forward while at the same time respecting and protecting the environment and, above all, the health of our citizens. I urge all Deputies to support it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>This necessary debate on waste is very welcome and I congratulate the Green Party on tabling the motion. To put it mildly, it was disappointing to hear the Minister&rsquo;s speech yesterday in which he made a vain attempt to undermine the motion rather than deal with the issues it raises. I do not necessarily agree with all the elements of the Green Party&rsquo;s motion but I respect its right to pursue its agenda in the House without having to put up with the arrogant approach of the Minister.</P>

	<P>The Minister should realise that nobody, including him, has a monopoly on wisdom.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that much progress has been made in this country in respect of waste management. Local authorities, under the guidance of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, have made much progress, starting at the basic level where they have focused on educational programmes for schools, including pilot programmes in this regard in <Col N="159"/>national schools. Importance has been attached to the Green flag, now much coveted by so many schools.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Much has been achieved in educating the public on the best way to deal with its waste. In general, one would have to say the public response has been positive but we must recognise that some members of the public are not prepared to play their part. The latter engage in the dirty habit of dumping their waste at the location most convenient to them, which can be anywhere.</P>
   <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <P>Last Tuesday morning, just outside Kinnegad, I witnessed what appeared to be a washing machine and a dryer dumped on the side of the N6, a national primary road. Some people must have filthy habits if they can do that. People are not prepared to take responsibility. They have the lazy, revolting view that they owe nothing and it is always somebody else&rsquo;s responsibility.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House calls for the power to be returned to local authorities to ensure that the making of a waste management plan is a reserve function. If we are to allow local authorities reach their full potential and live up to their name of delivering local government, every decision of this nature should be devolved to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities had the power to make regional waste management plans but that power was removed by the Minister at the time because he was of the view that local councillors were not prepared to make the plans. From a local perspective, however, local councillors were not making the best management plans because they disagreed fundamentally with the draft plans being put forward by the consultants. It must be said that all this happened at a time when the new approach to waste management was beginning and, because of that, it is timely that the return of the powers to local authorities be considered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Waste management is one of the most important issues facing the country. Ordinary householders have wrongly faced the double taxation of paying more than their fair share of income tax through the PAYE system and then paying further levies for the disposal of their household waste. Not content with forcing these unfair charges on ordinary citizens, they are then told they should do the extra work of sorting their waste before disposing of it. The irony is that people have been very quick to embrace that role and do what they can to help protect the environment while this Government has dragged its heels in formulating, implementing and enforcing a progressive waste management policy.</P>
    <P>A welcome feature in modern Ireland has been the introduction of recycling centres throughout the country, but the recent attempts to charge users of such facilities are scandalous. The people <Col N="160"/>who sort their rubbish before transporting it to such centres should be rewarded, not penalised. If a system were introduced whereby frequent users of recycling centres are rewarded by receiving a discount on their domestic refuse charges through a card system similar to those used in supermarkets, we might see a major increase in the use of recycling centres.</P>
    <P>The amount of waste generated by junk mail and newspaper supplements must be addressed as well, and not at the expense of the consumer. A tax should be put on those who wish to do a mail-drop. Similarly, newspaper companies who insert free books or DVDs, which invariably are wrapped in plastic and usually end up being dumped, should be taxed.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Roche, ran scared when a tax on chewing gum was mooted. Such a tax should be introduced immediately as the state of pavements throughout the country due to discarded chewing gum is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>The country has seen a dramatic increase in roadside dumping. One refuse bag quickly becomes a mini-dump as people go to any lengths to avoid paying disposal charges. There is also a rising trend of householders burning domestic rubbish in their fireplaces in another effort to avoid paying refuse charges. Local authorities must act quickly to eliminate such actions and introduce measures to continually encourage recycling and proper disposals.</P>
    <P>As other speakers mentioned, the question of landfills must be urgently addressed. Too often, landfills open with various guarantees given by local authorities only to be followed by poor management and little control. In my county, Clare County Council opened a new landfill site in September 2002, but already the county council is facing possible legal proceedings by the Environmental Protection Agency if it does not improve the operation of the site. Notice has been served on Clare County Council for operating outside the terms of its waste management licence. The main concerns of the EPA include the lack of adequate surface water control at the site. As well as this, the landfill liner membrane is not adequate, resulting in leaking from the dump.</P>
    <P>If a local farmer continued to be in breach of the EPA guidelines and compliance notice, he or she would be before the courts in double quick time, but the same rules do not appear to apply to Clare County Council. If anything, they should be more strictly enforced. County Clare attracts a large number of tourists annually but we can be sure that no one will ever be asked for directions to this dump as the odour emanating from the landfill can be smelled some distance away.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support for the Green Party motion as expressed by my colleague, Deputy Morgan. The Govern<Col N="161"/>ment&rsquo;s handling of the massive waste problem in this country has been a travesty of waste management and of democracy. During my first term in this House, I was a serving local authority member and, during those years, I saw the efforts of councillors, including of my own party, to have a real input into regional waste management plans thwarted and a sham public consultation process undertaken. The agenda was set by central Government and implemented by county and city managers over the heads of elected representatives. That was confirmed when the Government amended the law to remove powers of elected representatives to make waste management plans. That was done to impose waste incinerators on every region in this State, a project that is advancing slowly but surely. No one should make any mistake about that.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister, Deputy Roche, on the radio stoutly defending his plans for incinerators. I recall the same Minister saying he would not favour an incinerator in his county of Wicklow. His Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, with an eye to retaining his seat, is verbally opposing the incinerator planned for Ringsend. These are the very people who accuse those of us in the House who oppose incinerators on principle of being NIMBYs.</P>
    <P>It was the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, a former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who removed from locally elected representatives the power to adopt waste management plans because they refused to include incineration as a means of dealing with the waste issue. Instead, he gave those powers to unelected county managers who are forced to include incinerators in the regional waste plans because that is Government policy.</P>
    <P>Local communities, like those in Duleek and my area of Carrickroe, in north Monaghan, are now faced with incinerators being built in their locality contrary to the wishes of communities. That is unacceptable. I pay tribute to those communities which are fighting tooth and nail, and with few resources, to ensure that the environment they grew up in is passed on to their children in as good, if not better, a condition than they inherited.</P>
    <P>Local democracy has been incinerated by this Government. In our capital city, councillors voted to exclude the Ringsend waste incinerator from the development plan. The city council voted democratically against this incinerator, yet this week, my party colleague, Councillor Daith&iacute; Doolan, exposed the fact that the city management has spent &euro;10.5 million of public money promoting this unwanted scheme. A total of &euro;10.5 million has been paid out of public coffers to advance this project, including the procurement process and so-called public awareness. Of that, <Col N="162"/>&euro;104,000 has been spent by the city council on so-called public information sessions, newsletters, advertisements, posters and letters. As Councillor Doolan stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">The millions wasted on this public relations racket should rightly have been invested in promoting reduction of waste and invested in our fledgling recycling industry. That would have made a real difference to the waste crisis facing this City.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I refute the allegations of the Minister and his colleagues in the D&aacute;il and in the media that those who oppose incineration have no alternatives. For many years, the two main parties that make up the Technical Group &mdash; Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party &mdash; have had detailed practical policies on how the principles of reduce, reuse and recycle can be put into effect. During my first term in the D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in produced a detailed regional plan for waste management in my region covering counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath, including an address of the significant agricultural waste problem.</P>
    <P>Communities who oppose incinerators are the same communities who have consistently demanded more and better recycling facilities. People are ready and willing to support more initiatives to reduce waste, but this Government has been found wanting. It has failed to require industry to reduce packaging waste which ordinary householders end up paying for in refuse charges. It has privatised local authority refuse collection. This has left people on low incomes without the waiver scheme they availed of when refuse collection services were managed by local authorities. Those schemes were brought in to aid those for whom waste charges were clearly a heavy burden. At the very least we need private operators who are under contract to local authorities to operate waiver schemes. What is really needed is the reversal of the privatisation of waste management services.</P>

In regard to the heavier waste structure, including waste to energy, we are beginning to see progress at last in respect of public and private projects.</P>
    <P>During the debate the need to move segregated collections of biodegradable waste was mentioned. We, on this side of the House, could not agree more. Brown bin collections are now in place in Waterford and Galway. A pilot scheme is running in Fingal. Funding we committed last autumn will assist the construction of two facilities, which will permit the rolling out of brown bin collections across the entire Dublin region and other local authorities are following suit.</P>
    <P>There are those, however, who cling to the zero waste non-solution. It simply does not work. Those few areas outside of Europe where it has been tried have now tacitly admitted this fact. The Minister outlined some of the areas where this has been tried. The Government is committed to viewing waste as a resource.

	<P>The Minister of State wants to maximise the amount of waste.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;including the recovery of energy from waste. This is obviously a coherent integrated approach and the proper one to take. It is the course being followed by the environmentally most progressive societies including those where a Green Party is or has been in office. This sustainable approach to waste management requires that the necessary infrastructure is put in place including thermal treatment plants, but also a small number of highly engineered landfills. It really is not consistent for Green Party Deputies to rail against both incineration, with energy recovery, and landfill. If they rail against that, what credible alternatives can they offer?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The continental EU member states who achieve very high levels of recycling also rely heavily on incineration, with energy recovery. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, but complementary.</P>

	<P>What is the incinerator to be fed with?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Those who raise concerns about the health or the environmental impact of waste infrastructure conveniently ignore that Ireland has one of the most stringent regulatory systems in the world. These projects require both planning permission and waste licences. These are matters for the agencies, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the EPA, which have demonstrated their independence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the planning inspectors?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I stress in particular that both the health and the environmental impact concerns have been addressed. In the case of incineration, for example, EU standards which are the benchmark are devised with absolute regard for the best available scientific standards. I will refer to two important statements by Deputy Quinn, who questioned the Poolbeg incinerator. The test of value is whether the project meets the independently set public sector benchmark. In this case it does and this has been verified by the EIA.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore spoke about regulation of the private sector. In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Roche, he has clearly indicated that he will bring forward proposals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Cuffe and Sargent, if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle agrees.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about waste to energy or the use of energy cover to explain what is going on. As a councillor at the time when some of these decisions were made in the late 1990s, I confirm that no one ever mentioned energy. This was never on the agenda. It was purely a waste solution problem. In terms of burning, the reality is now 600,000 or 700,000 tonnes at Poolbeg, which originally started off at 300,000 or 400,000 tonnes. The plant inexorably grew in size over recent years. When one considers the energy output from it, one sees this is not an energy facility. With the equivalent of <Col N="165"/>whatever number of chimneys are put into Poolbeg one could build seven turbines within eyesight out on the Kish bank and provide the same amount of energy. If we need to provide that energy we should develop the turbines in the Kish bank, which were planned many years ago.</P>
    <P>The energy return from this, however, is remarkably poor. We are using up valuable natural resources. Plastics will have to go into this incinerator to make it burn or else fuel will have to be added. Effectively, we are taking oil-based products, scarce valuable materials which will increase in price, and burning them, and that is a waste of energy. Do not take it from me, take it from the British Plastics Federation, which said in a report on the matter that in energy terms, recycling of plastic made far more sense than incineration. Recycling one aluminium can saves 90% of the energy needed to produce a new one. Recycling 1 kg of plastics saves another 1.5 kgs of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> that is needed &mdash; and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> is our energy measurement as much as anything else these days. Again, that is saved if we are recycling.</P>
 <P>Manufacturing newsprint requires 2.5 times the amount of energy that we generate from burning it. Manufacturing glass requires 30 times the energy we would get from burning it. So this does not make energy sense. If we are serious about our energy policy, and we need to be, we certainly need to address it, but incineration will not solve our energy problems. Incineration is about dealing with waste in a certain manner. We do not agree on this side of the House that this is an effective, intelligent way of dealing with it. Matters have changed remarkably in the seven or eight years since the plan for the environment was hatched in the Department and imposed on local authorities around the country. What we have seen in the meantime is that people can, and will, go in the direction about which we are talking. In my council in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, in one year between 2004 and 2005, the tonnage brought to civic amenity increased 165%. The tonnage brought to bring banks increased 16%. The tonnage of green bin waste collected increased 25%. People want to do this. They want the alternative. Once they start putting stuff in the green bin, they do not want to go back. We are telling people we now need some of their waste because we need to burn it. That is not the clever way forward. It is not what the people of this city, Cork or any other part of the country want to do. They know they can do the right thing and recycle and that in energy, natural resource and economic terms, as well as in environmental terms, it is the clever thing to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody wants to recycle, but they are currently not being given enough opportunity to do so, despite Government pronouncements. The recent Forf&aacute;s waste management benchmarking report and the European Envir<Col N="166"/>onment Agency&rsquo;s report, entitled The European environment &mdash; State and Outlook 2005, highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s growing waste generation levels. The Forf&aacute;s report showed that individuals in Ireland produce more waste on average per annum than any of the other nine countries studied. The EEA report placed Ireland 24th out of 25 countries on the same measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will argue that increased waste generation figures result from increased economic growth, but does that mean we must wait until the economy slows down before we tackle our waste crisis? Economic growth and a building boom may have made our task more difficult, but that cannot be an acceptable excuse for doing nothing. The plastic bag levy is one of the few examples of the Government adopting measures to dampen waste generation. It is only today that the Minister grudgingly announced that he might consider adding 4 cent to the levy. I am not sure if that will change consumer behaviour. He should have made the legislation open enough in the first place to double the levy, because that would concentrate people&rsquo;s minds.</P>
    <P>Many Dubliners have been appalled by the level of litter and waste generated by the introduction of freesheet newspapers. They would be even more appalled if they realised the Government had been in discussion with the newspaper industry for over five years regarding the establishment of a producer responsibility scheme for the industry. To date, those negotiations have produced no results. The policy of the Green Party is to encourage industry to reduce the volume of packaging waste it generates. We need a carrot and a stick approach. We need to provide tax relief to businesses and industries that carry out research and development into redesigning products to extend their life cycle. We need to require manufacturers to make greater use of refillable, returnable containers for their products.</P>
    <P>However, this Government sees higher environmental standards as a threat to our economic competitiveness, despite much evidence to the contrary. An English report entitled The Contribution of Good Environmental Regulations to Competitiveness stated that waste minimisation could yield British manufacturers &euro;4.5 billion per annum. In other words, profits can be made by improving environmental quality. However, this Government is not going down that road. The Minister of State&rsquo;s embarrassment on where we stand in the European recycling leagues has led to him announcing recycling volumes in terms of how many times material could fill sports stadia. Second last is still second last, no matter how many times Croke Park can be filled.</P>
    <P>The Government established a market development group to identify new applications and markets for recyclable materials, but two years after its establishment, the group has made <Col N="167"/>no report or recommendations. We need a statutory agency charged with promoting research and development on recyclable materials, providing guidance to companies that wish to switch to more environmentally friendly products and providing grants to companies seeking to establish recycling facilities.</P>
    <P>In a recent reply to a D&aacute;il question, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said the costs of introducing deposit and refund infrastructure in Ireland would be prohibitively expensive and that Ireland had gone too far down an alternative route to consider deposit and refund schemes. When I asked him on 9 May whether the Department had carried out any financial and environmental comparisons between these schemes, I was informed that no formal study on the matter had been carried out in Ireland. The Minister is making poor decisions on critically important national issues. This is bad enough, but to make those decisions without carrying out formal studies is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The EPA&rsquo;s waste survey for 2004 showed that three quarters of Ireland&rsquo;s recyclable waste stream is exported. I wonder how stringent are the checks which ensure that all the material is recycled. A project on verification of waste destinations revealed irregularities with 30% of these waste shipments. Only one in five of the checks on Irish exports were actually carried out, so we cannot be smug when saying our waste is going to be recycled.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le gach duine a labhair sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r na daoine a thug taca&iacute;ocht don r&uacute;n &oacute;n gComhaontas Glas, le Fine Gael, P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre, Sinn F&eacute;in agus leis na Teachta&iacute; Neamhsple&aacute;cha.</P>
    <P>When we first drafted this motion, it was in response to the shameful growing international waste levels which Forf&aacute;s highlighted. However, it seems we have an even greater crisis on our hands following this debate, which is the failure of the Minister, Deputy Roche, to take any action to reduce waste levels. Such action has nothing to do with recycling, dumping or burning &mdash; it is about reduction. On that yardstick, this Minister and this Government are an abject failure. The Minister&rsquo;s insults &mdash; we got plenty of them last night &mdash; are no use whatsoever to the communities faced with plans for incinerators, landfills or any of the quick-fix solutions with which this Government has a fixation.</P>
    <P>Our motion is an honest attempt to address the need to reduce waste amounts generated under the watch of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has responsibility for waste reduction in the first instance. However, we now know that the Mini<Col N="168"/>ster is more familiar with obscure Canadian rock music than he is with waste reduction. Guelph in Ontario, Canada is an example of a city that faced up to the principle of looking after its own waste locally in every useful way possible. The incentives to reduce, reuse and recycle were strengthened in that city by a ban in the province of Ontario on the location of landfill on agricultural land or any wetland.</P>
    <P>There are reasons to be cautious. There is a need for a level of cleanfill, but that is not what we are getting from this Government. Landfill has given rise to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> entitled Birth Defect Risks Higher for Babies Living near Dumps. This is in reference to a study carried out by Imperial College London, which noted no particular difference between domestic refuse dumps and hazardous waste dumps. When an incinerator was proposed 20 years ago in Guelph, the people said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This was mainly because they did not want to see material burned which could be recycled. As they say about incinerators, &ldquo;when you get a pig, you have to feed it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are many companies creating jobs that do not want incinerators. Representatives from Wellman International, located on the Meath-Cavan border, have described to me that an incinerator would be a travesty for their company because an incinerator would demand the same material that their company uses for recycling.</P>
    <P>There are many examples of incinerators causing untold problems for communities. A newspaper report, entitled Cancer Village Fights for Justice over Incinerator, provides such an example from France. The report states that senior French officials face a toxins inquiry. Is that what the Minister wants to give us and is that what he is proposing? Let the record show that up to now the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has not shown up here for this debate. Likewise, when the Green Party had a previous debate on waste and gave him an opportunity to set out his position on the Poolbeg incinerator plan, he did not show up either.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Will he vote?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The interesting point is that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, now has a difficult decision to make because he knows from a statement made by the Minister, Deputy Roche, on a radio programme this morning that the Poolbeg incinerator plan is Government policy. I wonder if the Minister is elsewhere at the moment considering his resignation, as that would be the only logical thing for him to do.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Ten years ago Montreal had to forfeit a large amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money to have an incinerator removed. Perhaps the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government needs to come clean about the real costs that will be incurred over the next 30 years if his preferred <Col N="169"/>waste facilities are allowed to be built. The figure of &euro;250 million is the price tag so far for the Poolbeg black box incinerator plan. Meanwhile the first step to be taken, which the Minister, Deputy Roche, has still not made a requirement, is the total segregation of wet material from the remaining dry material. This is now legally required in Toronto and in more than half of the towns, cities and municipalities in Ontario. This results in more than 50% of waste being diverted from landfill from the start in terms of wet or dry material. It is a very simple requirement. The dry materials are then further segregated and any awkward composite items are then collected and returned to the importer or the manufacturer. The Minister needs to get his finger out and use the law we have given him to reduce waste.</P>
    <P>In Canada they call this the stewardship programme; here we call it the Waste Management <Col N="170"/>Act 1996. If the Minister reads section 29(3) and (4) of that Bill, he will note the powers contained in it to tackle the importers, manufacturers and people who are polluting and creating the waste. If Ireland can end litter generated from the use of plastic bags, we can also reduce other forms of waste. If Canada can ban Teflon frying pans because of cancer concerns and waste disposal problems, Ireland can do likewise.</P>
    <P>The Government has the power to design the taking of waste out of homes, workplaces and countries but it chooses instead to support the polluters and they dump on the people. When the election is held perhaps the polluters will vote for a Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government but the people certainly will not.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Glennon. I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise in the House the condition of the harbours in north Fingal, namely, Balbriggan, Skerries, Loughshinny and Rush, and to demand that the Minister of State provide the necessary Department funding to save the harbours, especially those in Balbriggan and Skerries which are in a deplorable condition.</P>
    <P>Prior to June 2004, the Balbriggan and Skerries harbours were under the jurisdiction of the Dublin Port Company. Over the years the company neglected its obligations and failed to carry out ongoing inspections and maintenance of both harbours, which led to the structure of the harbours being undermined to the extent that they are dangerous and liable to fall into the Irish Sea. Without any consultation, the Dublin Port Company in 2004 advertised for interest in the purchase of the two harbours. Two working harbours of strategic importance to the towns of Balbriggan and Skerries representing an important amenity for the people of the two towns and the wider areas were to be privatised and sold off.</P>
    <P Just="Left">This proposal was unacceptable to the Labour Party in Fingal and other community-based organisations and a campaign was embarked upon to save our harbours. The Deputies from the constituency, the county manager and Dublin Port Company met the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the <Col N="174"/>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss the crisis. At the meeting, my constituency colleagues and I demanded that the harbours be retained in public ownership and that if the company were unwilling to meet the capital costs of reinstating the harbours, one of the Departments should come up with the necessary funding.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Ministers unilaterally decided to transfer the harbours to Fingal County Council, which I welcomed. However, they failed to provide the finance necessary for the restoration. Following the transfer of responsibility to Fingal County Council, it commissioned a detailed structural survey of both harbours and also included the harbours at Rush and Loughshinny. Damage to the outer wall of the Balbriggan Harbour and the collapse of a portion of the west quay at Balbriggan occurred shortly after the transfer.</P>
    <P>Based on the findings of the survey, in July 2004 the cost of the restoration was estimated at &euro;2.96 million for Balbriggan, &euro;1.025 million for Skerries, &euro;15,000 for Rush and &euro;45,000 for Loughshinny, giving an overall total of &euro;3.88 million. Fingal County Council made an application for funding and received a paltry &euro;235,000. In 2005 the initial survey found that, based on the information available at the time, Skerries Harbour, which has existed for hundreds of years, is generally in a poor condition. A recent report by Royal Haskoning to Fingal County Council has major implications for the harbour. For example the steel pilings of the newer section of the harbour have reached the end of their useful life. The council needs to assess whether it is economically viable to retain the harbour as a working one in view of the works required.</P>
    <P>The company recently wrote a letter outlining its increasing concern about the structural viability of the extension of Skerries Harbour which may need to be closed pending the commencement of repairs. Arising from the recent studies, the cost will be an additional &euro;733,000 for Skerries, bringing the total required for that harbour to &euro;1.758 million and the total cost for the four harbours will be &euro;4.75 million. Action is <Col N="175"/>required. Fingal County Council and the people of Fingal cannot come up with this money nor should they, especially given the negligence of the Dublin Port Company in the past. Given the amenity value to north County Dublin, it is imperative that the Government comes up with the funding for these harbours.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan for allowing me to share his time and I endorse what he has said. The amenity value of these harbours for the people of the entire north side of Dublin cannot be overstated. The transaction giving rise to the current public ownership was rushed, to put it mildly. Both harbours have been described by some local councillors as pigs in pokes. At least pigs are still alive and we have a chance of getting them out of the poke.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Balbriggan and Skerries harbours were transferred from the ownership of the Dublin Port Company to the control of Fingal County Council, by ministerial order dated 29 June 2004, as provided for in the Harbours Act 1996.</P>
    <P>Government policy on ports, including regional harbours, is set out in the ports policy statement published in January 2005. The policy statement notes that many regional harbours have neither the resources nor the capability to comply with aspects of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, whereas their transfer to local authority control would bring improved corporate governance and allow the harbours to realise their amenity potential.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to advance the implementation of the ports policy statement with regard to the transfer of regional harbours to local authority control. The Department has invested in essential public safety works at a number of regional harbours in 2004 and 2005 and plans to continue with a similar programme of works in 2006. The Department proposes to make funds available to allow additional works to be undertaken at the regional harbours, where appropriate and justifiable, to protect the public and the fabric of the harbours. The Department is assessing what essential works might be undertaken in 2006 within the limited budget available.</P>
    <P>A Royal Haskoning proposal was received from Fingal County Council outlining the options for possible works at Balbriggan and Skerries harbours. In addition to existing disrepair at the harbours, storms in January 2005 caused substantial damage to the storm wall in Balbriggan which has historically been susceptible to partial collapses. Subject to verification by the engineering division of the Department responsible at the time, the Department of Communications, <Col N="176"/>Marine and Natural Resources, it was recommended that a grant payment could be made to Fingal County Council in respect of any invoiced works carried out in 2005 at Balbriggan and Skerries harbours.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Following receipt of a submission regarding works required at Balbriggan and Skerries harbours by Fingal County Council in 2005, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources made a once-off payment of &euro;231,817&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the horrific murder of James Purdue, aged 22, at Grattan Wood, Donaghmede, last Sunday night. This brutal assassination was the sixth horrific murder in the Dublin North-East area in the past five months. On 2 June, Keith Fitzsimons, aged 23, was savagely murdered in a garden at Millbrook Road. On 29 May, Patrick Harte was shot dead in Edenmore Avenue, Raheny. On 24 April, Gerard Goulding from central Dublin was callously murdered at St. Donagh&rsquo;s Road and on 5 March public opinion was rightly outraged when a young innocent mother, Ms Donna Cleary, aged 22, was a tragic victim of an appalling gun attack on a home in Coolock. Prior to her murder, a young Latvian man was stabbed to death in Artane.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The people of Dublin North-East whom I represent are outraged and deeply upset by this appalling catalogue of murders. My constituents are shocked that such horrors could be perpetrated on peaceful residential streets. They are rightly angry that children and ordinary householders have had to witness murder crime scenes and the spectacle of killers operating with apparent impunity in quiet residential streets. They are also rightly fearful that another such atrocity could be perpetrated at any time.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Taoiseach yesterday, the chief superintendent for the Dublin north metropolitan region, Peter Maguire, has called for political leadership in response to these appalling gun crimes and the vicious, drug-fuelled gang criminality which produced them. I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give such leadership. The Minister indicated yesterday that he had reported <Col N="177"/>to the Cabinet that dealing with the murderous gangs who perpetrate gun homicides is not a question of resources. If this is the case, why are vulnerable communities not saturated with garda&iacute; and specialist surveillance teams and why is blatant and regular drug dealing not stamped out and the criminals arrested and charged? The Taoiseach and the Minister never gave the Garda authorities sufficient resources to tackle this scourge. In my Garda district, for example, only 200 garda&iacute; struggle to meet the needs of almost 100,000 people, a larger population than that of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>Our 25 year campaign for a new Garda station in Donaghmede has gone unheeded and unanswered. Even Operation Anvil, as the Acting Chairman, Deputy Costello, has noted many times in the House, was only an <i>ad hoc</i> response to terrible crimes and the Garda authorities were not given sufficient resources to extend the operation to the whole north and west sides of Dublin. Responses in areas such as CCTV have been feeble, disorganised and poorly resourced.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In a thoughtful article in yesterday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, criminologist Dr. Ian O&rsquo;Donnell noted that high detection rates and a high probability of arrest are the best deterrents to the types of appalling crimes we have sadly witnessed in my constituency in recent months. It is time for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce new policies to remove evil gunmen from our streets once and for all and create a society in which casual and nihilistic violence will not be permitted and will not arise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this important debate on recent violent deaths and crime on the north side of Dublin. I offer my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. The vast majority of northside residents are disgusted by the recent horrific increase in violent crime and demand action from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and senior garda&iacute;. One death is too many and it is only by the grace of God that many other innocent people have not been killed in crossfire. The Minister must wake up to this major problem.</P>
    <P>People in Coolock and Clontarf are fed up with their areas being tarnished by negative images and publicity. Tonight I stand up for Coolock, Clontarf and all the northside. Drugs barons must get out of our communities, get off our streets and leave our young people alone. Our young people must ignore these violent criminals who bring death and destruction to our areas. They are not their friends or pals but peddlers of death on the streets of the northside.</P>
    <P>I demand action from the Minister and make three sensible proposals to deal with the current crisis. The Government must develop Operation Anvil and target violent drug gangs, ensure more community garda&iacute; are deployed on the streets to <Col N="178"/>work with people on the ground in communities and invest as a priority in the most disadvantaged areas, particularly in pre-school and primary education, housing and drug treatment schemes.</P>
    <P>Six people have been murdered in the area since February, five of them by firearms. Recently, I met the father of Donna Cleary, a 22 year old mother of a three year old boy who was shot dead at a party. Her family is devastated by the loss of their young daughter and have pleaded for the removal of guns from the city&rsquo;s northside. Let us do this in the coming months.</P>
    <P>We must also support the many residents of the northside who are being bullied and intimidated by gangs every night. Many serious incidents are not reported and the silence further allows the problem to spiral out of control. I urge action and demand the deployment of more garda&iacute; on the streets to tackle violent gangs. Above all, I demand leadership and more support for the decent people of the north side of Dublin.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Finian McGrath and Broughan for raising these matters on the Adjournment. I speak on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is unable to be present. As we speak, the Minister is attending a conference at Santry Garda station with the Garda Commissioner and other senior officers to discuss the recent murders and related policing and security issues.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the Minister and I consider the recent murders in the area concerned to be of the utmost gravity and the significant resources available to the Garda authorities will be brought to bear in a focused and methodical way to bring to account the persons involved in the crimes to which they referred. Sadly, the recent fatal shootings make it all too clear that a small number of criminals are prepared to take whatever action they deem necessary to protect what they regard as their interests, including resorting to extreme violence and murder. I, too, express my sympathy to the families of the victims of recent terrible murders.</P>
    <P>Killings within the criminal fraternity are usually well planned and often, due to their nature, more difficult to resolve. Fewer evidential links may be available to aid Garda investigations and witnesses are often unwilling to co-operate with the Garda. On Monday, the Minister had a meeting with the Garda Commissioner and senior management. The Commissioner set out how he is deploying the significant resources available to him this year to tackle serious crime, including gun crime. He informed the Minister that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not fall under any resource constraint in deploying garda&iacute; and equipment to address the challenges arising in the areas of crime and the maintenance of public order. Nevertheless, the Minister reiterated to the Commissioner that any resources required by him would be provided. In the meantime a further <Col N="179"/>conference was arranged to discuss the local aspects of these issues. This conference is in train this evening.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner informed the Minister that of the 29 murders that have taken place this year, 13 of which involved the use of a firearm, 20 have already been solved and files have either been sent to the DPP or are being prepared for submission to the DPP. Regarding the other nine murders, investigations are ongoing and steady progress is being made in these investigations.</P>
    <P>Since June 1997, it has been a priority of the Government to tackle crime in all its manifestations. Never before in the history of the State has our criminal justice system been better resourced in terms of manpower and funding. The Government has legislated wisely and extensively and will continue to do so. We have undertaken an ambitious reform of the institutions that make up our criminal justice system, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the court and prison systems.</P>
    <P>Despite the understandable concern which follows serious incidents such as those mentioned, the headline crime rate has decreased from 29 crimes per 1,000 in 1995 to 24.5 crimes per 1,000 in 2006. Serious crime in the Dublin north division has declined by 7% on the same period last year. These figures notwithstanding, the fight against crime is a never-ending battle. Deputies will be aware that Ireland has a low headline crime rate, including the rate for murder, compared with other western societies and, for this, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s top policing priority for 2006 is to continue to target organised crime, including drug trafficking and the gun culture associated with it. This is being implemented through the deployment of specialist units by the Garda authorities and the use of targeted intelligence led operations to tackle specific criminal activities. Contrary to the comments made by the Deputies, Operation Anvil has proven to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs. It has resulted in a number of high profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals. This year, it has been extended nationwide from the Dublin metropolitan region. A budget of approximately &euro;11 million has been allocated for Operation Anvil during 2006 and the Garda Commissioner was recently advised that an additional &euro;10 million has been made available for further operations to tackle gang related crime.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures available to me show that since the introduction of Operation Anvil in May 2005, 527 firearms have been seized. It has also resulted in more than 2,830 arrests for serious crimes, including 43 in respect of murders, and a total of 1,298 individuals have been charged.</P><Col N="180"/>
    <P>With the attestation on 8 June of 273 new members, the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,641. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 on 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,939, or 18.1%, in the personnel strength of the force since then. Every three months, 275 newly attested garda&iacute; come on stream and the strength of the force will be 14,000, including attested officers and those in training, by the end of this year. The Garda budget is at a record high of &euro;1.3 billion, an increase of 117% on the 1997 provision of &euro;600 million.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government will continue to prioritise the fight against criminals and that the fight will be won.</P>

    <sTitle>Schools Building Projects.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter, which is of considerable importance in terms of the safety of the students attending Col&aacute;iste Mhuire, Mullingar, and greatly concerns parents and the board of management of the school. Col&aacute;iste Mhuire is one of a number of secondary schools in Mullingar and my own <i>alma mater</i>. I remember attending the school in the late 1960s.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Education and Science to provide the funding to complete the entrance to the school, the work on which was begun at the request of her Department. The original vehicle entrance to the school passed through the primary school playground. Annual intake at the school was 110 pupils but increased this year to 130, with many more on the waiting list. Last year, a new extension was added to the school&rsquo;s already fine building. It is a tremendous educational establishment and, like the other schools in Mullingar, has achieved strong academic results for its students.</P>
    <P>A new entrance is essential from a health and safety perspective. The original entrance through the playground was not a danger in the past when traffic was lighter and mostly pedestrian. Now, however, a significant volume of traffic passes through the entrance, which is located beside Mullingar cathedral and Garda station.</P>
    <P>The school made two applications to the Department. It first applied under the emergency fund scheme but was told to apply under the summer works scheme. As soon as the school applied under the latter scheme, however, it was told that the Department had no more money. Talk about running around in circles. The essential issue of safety has not yet been addressed. A few minor accidents have occurred at the original entrance but, thankfully, none was serious.</P>
    <P>The new extension to Col&aacute;iste Mhuire was opened with great fanfare by the Minister, an event I was delighted to attend as a former pupil of the school. After the opening of the extension, the school was advised to desist from using the original entrance and to construct a new entrance. <Col N="181"/>Planning permission was received for the project and it was then put to tender. The lowest bid for the work was &euro;160,000. However, funding under the summer works scheme for 2006 has been refused.</P>
    <P>The principal, board of management, parents association and the pupils have asked me to intervene in this important matter and to help ensure that a safe entrance is constructed. All the school needs is &euro;160,00 but, even if it were funded to the extent of &euro;100,000, the parents association and board of management could raise the remaining funds.</P>
    <P>This safety issue has caused great concern to everybody involved. I will not compare &euro;160,000 with the vast sums wasted on other projects over recent years. In the context of our children&rsquo;s safety, &euro;160,000 is a small figure. If an accident occurred involving one of the students because of the Department&rsquo;s failure to provide the funds to complete the entrance, what would we say? We have an opportunity at present to prevent an accident by completing the entrance to this excellent 600-pupil school. I urge the Minister to provide the necessary funds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science on capital investment at Col&aacute;iste Mhuire, Mullingar.</P>
    <P>Modernising the facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging demands in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, this Government has shown its determination to improve the condition of school buildings and ensure that appropriate facilities are in put place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the Government has invested in the largest school building programme in the history of the State. Between 1998 and the end of 2004, almost &euro;2 billion was invested in school buildings and approximately 7,500 large and small projects were completed in schools, including 130 brand new schools and 510 large-scale refurbishments and extensions. Funding for school building and renovation projects has increased five-fold since 1997. In 2006, &euro;491 million will be spent on school building projects compared with &euro;92 million in 1997. In its own right, the 2006 allocation represents an increase of more than 9% in real terms on the 2005 allocation.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, at the end of last year, the Department of Education and Science outlined its spending plans for primary and post-primary schools for 2006. With &euro;491 million to be spent on school buildings, more than 1,300 projects will be active in schools throughout the country. This significant investment will allow the Department to continue to progress its prog<Col N="182"/>ramme of school building and modernisation, which includes improving the equipment needed for new technologies.</P>
    <P>With regard to capital investment at Col&aacute;iste Mhuire, in September 2002, the Department of Education and Science approved a large extension project of more than 1,300 sq. m. at a cost of &euro;2.8 million. This extension consisted of two general classrooms, ten specialist rooms and a number of general areas. The project was completed in late 2004.</P>
    <P>The school made an application to the Department for capital grant aid for a new entrance under the 2006 summer works scheme. The application was examined by the Department&rsquo;s school planning section but was not approved because a large number of other applications received in respect of projects had a higher priority under the terms of the summer works scheme. Projects totalling more than &euro;84 million across 824 schools were approved under the 2006 summer works scheme earlier this year. The Deputy will be aware that the Department recently published details of the 2007 summer works scheme and it is open to the school authorities in question to apply under this scheme if it wishes to be considered for funding for the proposed improvement works.</P>
    <P>I will speak to the Minister with regard to this project. My late father taught in Col&aacute;iste Mhuire a long time ago, so I would certainly like to see the entrance built.</P>

    <sTitle>Water and Sewerage Schemes.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter because it is of critical importance to the towns of Dunmore and Kilkerrin in my constituency of Galway East. These towns are seeking modern sewerage schemes which would serve their expanding populations. After much lobbying and work done locally, limited progress was made in this matter. Both schemes were approved for funding by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s water services investment programme for 2005-07.</P>
    <P>In September 2005 the tender recommendations for the construction of the collection networks for both schemes were approved by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The collection networks for both towns are substantially complete. The tender documents for the design build operate treatment plants have not yet been approved so the project cannot proceed. While 50% of the modern sewerage system for both towns, comprising the collection system and the treatment system, has been allowed to proceed, the remaining 50% has not been approved. The pipes are in the ground but the waste matter cannot flow to an end receptacle or treatment plant.</P>
    <P Just="Left">If this was not so serious it would laughable. This is the greatest example of gombeen plan<Col N="183"/>ning. Where is the strategic planning the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would have us believe exists in Government? How did the Department allow this to happen? How can the Minister stand over this slipshod behaviour and who is responsible for this debacle? Dunmore and Kilkerrin have been deprived of basic infrastructure for too long. They cannot expand and progress as other towns have done. Builders and developers willing to invest cannot get planning permission for developments, a totally unacceptable situation. Have the tender documents been approved? Can the Minister of State give an undertaking that they will be approved immediately? If Galway County Council must supply further information, can this be demanded immediately? How can documentation prepared by consultants, approved by local authority officials and forwarded to the Department be found unsatisfactory? Can a phone call not be made to clarify a point, sanction the documentation and move on? Our rural towns must make progress, red tape must be eliminated and gombeen processing of projects must be stopped. We must move into the modern world of efficiency and strategic planning.</P>
    <P>The tender document for the design build operate element of the contract was forwarded to the Department in 2005. At the Department&rsquo;s request it was revised and resubmitted in January 2006. It has remained in the Department since. I fear the Minister of State will tell us that additional information is being sought from Galway County Council. If that is the case, someone is negligent. The Minister of State should inform us if that is the case and outline the action intended by the Minister to eliminate incompetence and approve these projects for the people of Dunmore and Kilkerrin.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond on behalf of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heri<Col N="184"/>tage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. The water services investment programme 2005-07, published last December, includes some 60 water and sewerage schemes, with a value of more than &euro;451 million for Galway. Many areas of the county, such as Carna, Kilkieran, Tuam and Headford, will benefit from improved water supplies. New regional water supply schemes for Costelloe, Gort, Ballinasloe, Clifden, Loughrea, Dunmore, Glenamaddy and Portumna are also included. Towns and villages such as Athenry, Ballinasloe, Barna, Carraroe, Clifden, Glenamaddy, Headford, Miltown, Oughterard, and Tuam can also expect new or upgraded sewerage schemes. All schemes will play a major role in the development of the residential, tourism and commercial sectors of these areas.</P>
    <P>The Dunmore and Kilkerrin sewerage schemes are also included in the water services investment programme and are approved for funding under the rural towns and villages initiative. Galway County Council&rsquo;s tender recommendations for the construction of the collection networks for both these schemes using a single contract were approved in September 2005. The network in Kilkerrin is substantially complete and that work is well under way in Dunmore.</P>
    <P>The treatment plants for both schemes are being procured by way of a single design build operate contract that also includes Leenane. The Minister approved Galway County Council&rsquo;s revised tender documents for the treatment plants for the three locations earlier this month. Approval of the tender documents allows the council to invite tenders for the construction of the treatment plants from a panel of short-listed contractors already in place. Further progress on the scheme is now a matter for the county council.</P>

	<P>The introduction of Knowledge Acquisition Grants and Innovation Vouchers were recommended by the Small Business Forum in its report submitted to me last month. I set up the Forum last year to consider the environment in which small businesses operate and to advise on the appropriateness and adequacy of the public policy responses in the context of that environment.</P>
    <P>Since publishing the report last month my Department has been pursuing the recommendation concerned with the relevant agencies and initial consultations have already taken place with Enterprise Ireland in relation to the proposal for the provision of knowledge acquisition grants. We will be developing an appropriate response to this recommendation over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The proposal to introduce innovation vouchers is based primarily on a similar scheme which has recently been put in place by the Dutch Innovation Agency. The proposal is intended primarily as a means of promoting innovation amongst the small business community. This is a novel concept and it will require detailed consideration to establish how exactly it would work. My Department has initiated this examination and <Col N="186"/>hopes to be in a position to respond to the recommendation over the coming months also.</P>

	<P>The Health and Safety Authority were involved in 40 legal proceedings &mdash; 22 summary and 18 on indictment in 2005. The overall conviction rate was 85%.</P>
    <P>In addition to the prosecution options, the Health and Safety Authority also has a range of other enforcement remedies available to it, including the seeking of a High Court Order to have a dangerous workplace closed down and the issuing of enforcement notices such as Prohibition and Improvement notices. In the specific area of construction, the Health and Safety Authority carried out 6,203 inspections in 2005 and of this figure, 46% resulted in enforcement action of varying degree, i.e., the issue of 393 Prohibition Notices, 118 Improvement Notices and 2350 written advices. Follow up inspections are undertaken to ensure compliance. Non-compliance in the construction sector showed a marginal reduction in 2005 at 28% in comparison with 33% in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Since the year 2000, 70 successful trials on indictment have been concluded on foot of investigations by the Health and Safety Authority, some of which have been in cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These have resulted in fines of up to &euro;1m in some cases and suspended prison sentences for breaches of health and safety legis<Col N="187"/>lation and the offence of reckless endangerment under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The value of entrepreneurship amongst young people and enterprise education in contributing to the future strong economic development of this country has been acknowledged in two recent significant policy Reports i.e. the Report of the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) and Report of the Small Business Forum (SBF). Both Reports have outlined a recommended strategic approach to enterprise education going forward and I have asked my Department to examine, in consultation with the Department of Education and Science, how we can best progress these recommendations.</P>
    <P>My Department is, however, already involved in a number of initiatives to promote entrepreneurship amongst young people. State funding <Col N="188"/>for enterprise promotion, including the promotion of enterprise within the education system, is primarily channelled through the relevant State Agencies.</P>
    <P>In this regard the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have a well-established role in the delivery of enterprise education. As part of their enterprise promotion activities the CEBs support teachers in the delivery of enterprise programmes designed to give students practical experience of setting up and running their own business. The annual &lsquo;Student Enterprise Awards&rsquo; (SEA) scheme, organised by the CEBs, involves some 10,000 second-level students each year. The activities of the CEBs in this area already represent a considerable commitment of resources and expenditure of public funds.</P>
    <P>In addition Enterprise Ireland is actively involved with all Universities and Institutes of Technology in fostering entrepreneurship amongst the student population and particularly in supporting the translation of research activity into commercial enterprises through its Student Enterprise Awards. Enterprise Ireland is also involved in a number of other enterprise education initiatives such as the &lsquo;Campus Companies Initiative&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Innovation Partnerships Scheme&rsquo;. Under this latter scheme financial support is provided to encourage companies to undertake research projects with Irish universities and Institutes of Technology. Enterprise Ireland is also working with Institutes of Technology to develop on-campus incubation centres to facilitate the generation of new high growth companies and Institutes of Technology will receive over &euro;380m for the establishment of business incubation centres.</P>
    <P>There are also, of course, a number of non-State organisations involved in enterprise education whose focus is different to that of the CEBs in terms of approach and target audience. As part of the future approach to enterprise education we will need to explore options for closer co-operation between all the players so as to ensure that we can deliver an enterprise education that is integrated and complementary.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 56 together.</P>
    <P>The principal objective of the Consumer Sentiment Index is to record details on consumer attitudes towards trends in the economy. It, therefore, complements other data such as the value of personal consumption. In this respect consumer spending is still very strong with early CSO figures on the value of retail sales showing a 7.6% year-on-year growth for March of this year.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the Index attempts to measure the &lsquo;mood&rsquo; of consumers, tracking it from month to month. It is not based on hard economic data. As such it is a volatile measurement and while the figure was higher in April, the May figure is, in fact, identical to the figure for March of this year. Accordingly, caution must be exercised in drawing conclusions from short-term movements in the index.</P>
    <P>It is a primary objective of this Government to maintain and strengthen the competitiveness of the Irish economy. As stated in the new Partnership Agreement, improving competitiveness also means bringing more competition and a fair deal to consumers. Providing better consumer information and protection will empower consumers <Col N="190"/>to achieve good value for money and help lower costs. The value of a pro-consumer agenda will be promoted in stronger terms as the National Consumer Agency strengthens its operations and as its mandate develops into consumer advocacy, research, information, enforcement, education and awareness. The Agency will, accordingly, become a forceful statutory advocate for consumer rights and will be empowered and resourced to promote the consumers&rsquo; case with regulated industries and individual regulators. These actions should underpin consumer confidence going forward.</P>
    <P>The Small Business Forum, that I established last Summer, has just completed a review of the key issues facing the small business sector. The Forum&rsquo;s report has presented me with a comprehensive set of proposals which were designed to enable the small business sector to achieve its full potential and to enhance the significant contribution which the sector already makes to the economic well-being of this country. I will be seeking to implement all the recommendations that fall within my Department&rsquo;s remit over the coming months and I am working closely with my Government colleagues to look at an implementation path for the remaining recommendations which do not fall within my area of responsibility.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
     <Quest>if the Government plans to ratify the 1990 UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families in view of the fact that there is a need for greater protection of the interests of migrant workers and their families here which is not catered for by Irish law.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23478/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I and other Ministers have indicated in response to similar questions in the past, Ireland is not a party to the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990. Nor has Ireland ratified this Convention.</P>
    <P>Other Member States of the European Union have not signed or ratified this Convention either. In fact, up until last year only 27 countries worldwide had actually ratified it.</P>
    <P>This Convention is a complex cross-cutting one, which has been examined by several Government Departments. I understand that before Ireland could consider ratifying it there would need to be significant changes across a wide range of existing legislation, including employment, social welfare, education, taxation and electoral law. Many of the issues addressed by the Convention would have a European Union dimension and this would also complicate any <Col N="191"/>proposed ratification by Ireland of it, if our European partners were to continue to refrain from ratification, as they seem likely to do.</P>
    <P>In this context there are no plans to ratify this Convention. However, that is not to say that I am not committed to many of the ideals and aspirations which the Convention tried to further. In particular, I am fully committed to the prevention of exploitation of migrant workers and to ensuring that all workers benefit from the full range of our employment rights protections.</P>
    <P>In this respect I would point out that this range of protections has been added to by the Employment Permits Bill 2005, which was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 14th June 2006. It provides a number of new important protections for migrant workers including: the granting of the employment permit to the employee, rather than the employer, the employment permit containing a statement of the rights and entitlements of the migrant worker, including that the employee may change employment through the application for another permit by a new employer.</P>
    <P>I would also emphasise that the current proposals for a new Social Partnership agreement contain a new employment rights compliance package for all workers, which includes new legislation as well as the establishment of a new Office for Employment Rights Compliance.</P>

     <P LI="1">3. An impact assessment was carried out on the EU&rsquo;s draft REACH Regulation during 2004 on commissioned by Forf&aacute;s. While the assessment was far more in-depth than a screening RIA, it was not a full RIA in the sense that it was confined to economic impact, and did not address other impacts.</P><Col N="192"/>
     <P LI="1">4. A screening RIA is currently being undertaken on the amended draft Directive on Services.</P>
   <P LI="1">5.

The Strategy sets out a vision for Ireland as &ldquo;internationally renowned for the excellence of our research by 2013, to the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture&rdquo;, and then clearly identifies the challenges ahead and the practical steps which we need to take to deliver on this vision. It is all about enabling Ireland to develop world class people and enterprises with the drive and resources to succeed.</P>
    <P>The Strategy clearly identifies how we should develop a world class research system. This will involve us doubling the number of PhDs, addressing the capture, protection and commercialisation of knowledge generated from publicly funded <Col N="193"/>and collaborative research and providing supports and encouragement to industry to dramatically grow business expenditure on R&amp;D to &euro;2.5bn. The Strategy tackles the need to promote science as a subject and a career choice among our young people and the need to give teachers the skills to do this. It covers the whole range of research-performing sectors and focuses on the potential in areas like health, agri-food and forestry, energy, marine and environment. It builds on the potential synergies between sectors and underlines the importance to Ireland of international collaboration and enhanced cooperation on STI issues on the island of Ireland as a whole. In so doing, the Strategy clearly demonstrates that the whole island of Ireland is an excellent place to do research.</P>
    <P>The Strategy sets clear targets which will continue to be monitored and fine-tuned during its lifetime by a small number of interconnected high-level groups, including Technology Ireland under the direction of the Cabinet Committee on STI which I chair. This ongoing monitoring will ensure that the important whole of Government approach adopted in preparation is maintained throughout the period of delivery of the Strategy. The timeline of the Strategy is an eight-year one, to 2013 and resources of &euro;192 million up to 2008 have been provided by Government to enable work on delivering the Strategy to commence with immediate effect.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Strategy, which will form a central plank of the forthcoming NDP, will involve Government expenditure of approximately &euro;2.7bn up to 2008. Over &euro;2bn will be spent on maintaining the existing levels of service while almost half a billion euro has already been provided in the form of Capital Envelope commitments by Government Departments in the current budgetary cycle. Of the additional sums available for the years 2007/2008 (&euro;66m in 2007, &euro;126m in 2008) funding will be made available for public sector research, enterprise support, infrastructural support and programmatic measures.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the allocations in the existing Capital Envelopes and existing levels of service spending projected to 2013, the net additional resources required to implement the Strategy in full have been costed at &euro;1.88 bn over the period to 2013. As the Strategy indicates decisions on the detailed funding arrangements for the remainder of the Strategy beyond 2008 will be made by Government in the context of the new National Development Plan to be published later this year.</P>
    <P>The implementation mechanisms for delivery are set out in detail in the Strategy itself, but, essentially funding under the Strategy will be allocated using a variety of existing means including EI, IDA, SFI, PRTLI and the Research Councils operating in a coordinated manner, with oversight by a Higher Education Research Group and Technology Ireland and reporting to the <Col N="194"/>Interdepartmental Committee on STI, which in turn will report to the Cabinet Committee on STI. This will ensure a complementarity of approach between research funding bodies and focus our research performance in areas of economic and social priority.</P>
    <P>Within this process, the Institutes of Technology will have a very important and valuable role to play, supporting the development of R&amp;D performance in regional enterprise and building on collaborative efforts with enterprise. The Strategy envisages that the IoTs will develop a shared agenda that will serve to strengthen their research and commercialisation performance.</P>

	<P>This Government is committed to addressing the needs of those with disabilities. In particular, we are committed to removing the obstacles which make it difficult for people with disabilities to participate in the <Col N="195"/>labour market. We have already done a lot in this area.</P>
    <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s mainstreaming policy, my Department through F&Aacute;S is seeking to increase the participation of disabled workers through a three-pronged approach involving:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>facilitating progression into sustainable employment through skills development</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>stimulating awareness amongst employers of the contribution that disabled people can make and encouraging them to recruit them, and</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>providing specific employment supports for disabled people and employers.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">People with disabilities now benefit from the full range of FAS training programmes and services. Since 2002 FAS has realised approximately 29,000 placements of people with disabilities in employment, training and other options and the FAS budget for vocational training and employment for people with disabilities has increased from &euro;54 million to over &euro;67 million. Of this &euro;67 million, &euro;46.8million is being used by Specialist Training Providers, over &euro;10 million is for the new Wage Subsidy Scheme, &euro;8 million is for the Supported Employment Programme and &euro;2million is being used for Disability Support Awareness.</P>
    <P>FAS also provides an extensive range of schemes and grants specifically to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector. These include:</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The Workplace or Equipment Adaptation Grant</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The Employee Retention Grant Scheme</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The Job Interview Interpreter Grant and</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The Personal Reader Grant.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">In 2005 I launched a new Wage Subsidy Scheme. This is a significant initiative, which has a 2006 budget of &euro;10.25m, administered by FAS. The scheme offers financial support to employers outside the public sector to encourage them to employ disabled people who work in excess of 20 hours per week. Unlike other schemes, the potential exists for both the employee and the employer to receive an incentive.</P>
    <P>The Sectoral Plan, which my Department is currently finalising for its area of responsibility in the context of the Disability Act, 2005 will help set the agenda for future work addressing issues for people with disabilities participating in the labour market. The Plan will provide for an overall employment strategy of engagement, in collaboration with other key Government Departments and agencies. In this way we will support people with disabilities into employment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 101 together.</P>
    <P>The Expert Advisory Group&rsquo;s Report on Workplace Bullying was launched and published by me on the 17th August 2005. The 2005 Report follows on from a 2001 Report by the Taskforce on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying. The recommendations of the 2001 Taskforce were implemented; the main ones being,</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the publication of the dignity at work charter</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the formulation of codes of practice by the Health and Safety Authority, the Equality Authority and the Labour Relations Commission, and,</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central coordinating State agency. The Authority established a specialist anti-bullying unit and recruited a psychologist for the work involved.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">Despite this, it became evident that the problem of bullying in the workplace has persisted. The Expert Advisory Group, which reported last July, although there was not full agreement within the group, made proposals to deal with the problem. An important recommendation contained in the 2005 Report was that a follow up survey on workplace bullying, similar to that commissioned for the 2001 Report, be conducted as soon as practicable to establish a baseline from which the effectiveness of the new structures and processes would be measured. I am implementing this Recommendation in order to have up-to-date information on which to base further action.</P>
    <P>The Department advertised in November 2005 for tenders to undertake the survey but only one tender was received. It was readvertised in January 2006 following which 4 tenders were received. The contract for the survey was recently awarded to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) following a competitive tendering process. I understand that it will take <Col N="197"/>the institute about 6 months to conduct the survey and report.</P>
    <P>I have already given a commitment to publish the results of the survey and to bring the results to Government along with the Report and the views of the Social Partners and other interested parties. The Government will then decide on how best to implement the Report&rsquo;s Recommendations.</P>
    <P>When the report of the Expert Advisory Group was published 17 submissions were received in the Department from the Social Partners and other interested parties. The main elements recommended by the Advisory Group are that,</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>there should be a statutory provision which required all employers to set down a policy in their Safety Statements to deal with incidents of bullying which come to attention in all workplaces, which the Health and Safety Authority would be responsible for enforcing</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the Labour Relations Commission would be responsible for providing the option of mediation or investigation,</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>if internal procedures did not bring about a resolution of a problem at the level of the workplace, even after mediation and investigation, then the State should legislate to provide the services of existing industrial relations machinery to investigate and bring a conclusion to each particular case,</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the recommendations of the Advisory Group in this latter regard are that the services of the Rights Commissioner Service should be availed of; and in the event of an appeal the services of either the Labour Court or the Employment Appeals Tribunal should be used. The decision of either of these two bodies should be final and conclusive; and if necessary legally enforceable through the civil courts.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">When the results of the ESRI survey on the incidence of bullying in the workplace are reported the Government will decide on how best to implement the Advisory Group&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>

     <Quest>the measures which have been taken within the framework of the National Development Plan for locating an increased proportion of new investment projects in objective one regions designated under the EU regional aid; the measures adopted in response to the loss of 50 per cent of coverage under the new EU regional aid guidelines.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment to this country and its regions. Under the Industrial Development Acts I am precluded from giving directives in respect of individual cases or in giving preference to one area over others.</P>
    <P>One of the key objectives of IDA Ireland strategy since the beginning of the current Operational Programme for Industry in 2000 has been to encourage more balanced regional development. IDA Ireland has taken a number of proactive steps to promote this objective. The Agency has adopted a target of trying to achieve 50% of all new Greenfield FDI first time jobs to locate in the BMW region. This is an ambitious target relative to the 25% share being won by the BMW region in the late 1990&rsquo;s. Over the 2000-2005 period an estimated 40% of all new Green<Col N="199"/>field first time jobs have been located in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>Over recent years the Agency has substantially upgraded the scale, resources and management responsibility of its regional offices, in order to enhance its ability to maximise the amount of FDI that locates in the BMW region. The level of infrastructure in much of the Objective 1 region, in terms of scale, capacity and quality, is still being developed with a view to accommodating high technology and infrastructure intensive investment projects. FDI projects also have a very strong preference for locating in a major urban centre, with its concentration of labour, services, transport links, and infrastructure. Development of the NSS Gateways and Hubs will assist in offering a wider choice to potential FDI projects in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the loss of coverage in part of the country from the beginning of 2007 it should be noted that Regional Aid coverage will be retained in the Objective 1 region and the South-East Region (Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow and south Tipperary), albeit at reduced rates, for the entire 2007-2013 period. The reduced coverage in regional aid directly affects capital and employment grants. Ireland will continue to retain full national coverage for other forms of grant such as R&amp;D and Training, which are classified as &ldquo;horizontal aids&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;regional aids&rdquo;. This is important since a key focus of IDA strategy for some time has been to develop the mandate and strategic importance of the existing FDI base, and win new client companies, by promoting Ireland as a premier location for high value/high skill innovation orientated functions such as R&amp;D.</P>
    <P>In light of the reduced capability to grant aid in much of the country in the future the current IDA Ireland strategy puts a critical focus on the areas of infrastructure, education and innovation, and is centred round developing an innovation-driven value proposition for Ireland and connecting this offering to international companies in a more globalised world economy.</P>

	<P>Last month the Small Business Forum reported to me, making a number of recommendations to improve the environment for the conduct of small business in Ireland. These recommendations include measures to address the administrative burden on small business. These are being followed up on by my <Col N="200"/>Department, other Departments or agencies, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am currently fast-tracking legislation to raise the audit exemption limit applying to small companies to the maximum permitted by EU legislation, i.e. turnover of &euro;7.3m and balance sheet of &euro;3.65m. This will remove the compulsory annual audit costs from the very large number of companies qualifying from the enhanced exemption level.</P>
    <P>The Business Regulation Forum is currently gathering evidence on regulation with a view to making recommendations at the end of this year for reform of areas where regulation is considered disproportionate, inefficient or ineffective. All businesses will benefit from this. The analysis may also suggest measures specifically appropriate to small businesses.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past year the number of persons in employment increased by 89,800 or 4.7%. This indicates that the Irish labour market remains extremely buoyant, with job creation far exceeding job losses. Over 500,000 jobs have been created since 1997, which is testament to the successful economic and enterprise development policies which this Government intends to continue into the future through the implementation of the Enterprise Strategy Group Action Plan. I am confident that these policies will create more jobs into the future.</P>
    <P>There were 88,200 persons unemployed in the first quarter of 2006, as measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, which is an unemployment rate of 4.2% among the lowest rates in the EU. While this represents an annual increase of 6,100, it is 3,100 lower than in the previous quarter. The number of long term unemployed has fallen by 1,600 in the past year to 26,200 and at 1.3% remains extremely low by international and historical standards.</P>
    <P>However, we are not complacent about the level of long term unemployment and in order to reduce it a range of measures are being implemented. These include increasing the focus on the activation of the long term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups through the Community Employment and Job Initiative Programmes, the F&Aacute;S and Local Employment Services, and the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) referral process.</P>
    <P>Under the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP), F&Aacute;S offers unemployed people training, re-training, job placement and other employability measures. This referral process has been very effective in encouraging and supporting the unemployed to participate in the labour market. The extension of the referral process to other disadvantaged groups is currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>Other innovative responses developed by my Department and F&Aacute;S to assist unemployed persons, have included:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the Pathways programme which identifies the most appropriate development pathway to assist clients to obtain employment</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the High Supports Process which assists clients on a multi-agency basis to address personal barriers to employments</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the Customised Training Fund to flexibly meet training needs of the unemployed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the question relates to the recent abolition of the Groceries Order. The Groceries Order was abolished because it allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices being charged to consumers, virtually eliminated price competition in the grocery trade, resulted in more than 2,000 small independent retailers going out of business in a fifteen year period, and caused the grocery trade in Ireland to become more concentrated in the hands of fewer participants. The combined impact of these events was to create a floor price below which groceries could not be sold and this resulted in Irish consumers paying more for their groceries than would otherwise have been the case.</P>
    <P>The Groceries Order was in existence for a period of 18 years and it fundamentally altered the structure and composition of the grocery trade. It is simply unrealistic to expect this process and the damage caused by 18 years of the operation of the Order to be reversed in the space of 3 months. I do not think we should expect to see fundamental changes in market share, for example, in the short term.</P>
    <P>Recent inflation figures suggest that grocery prices have increased since the Order was removed. However, suggestions that such increases are as a result of greater competition following the removal of the Order, or that the removal the Order has failed in its objective, are a nonsense and do not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>There are many factors which impact on the price of groceries in our supermarkets. The lack of competition caused by the Groceries Order was only one such factor. Others would include production costs, labour costs, interest rates, overheads, international exchange rates and so on. Because of this, and despite the implication in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I never made any predictions as to the likely extent of price reductions resulting from the removal of the Order or as to the period of time over which such reductions might be expected to occur.</P>
    <P>If we are looking for explanations for rising grocery prices, do not blame the removal of the Groceries Order. On the contrary the removal of the Order will undoubtedly counter other inflationary pressures.</P>
    <P>I think consumers are already seeing early benefits with one multiple recently announcing <Col N="203"/>their intention over coming months to implement reductions in the prices of products previously covered by the Groceries Order. The real benefits however will be felt over time, as price competition re-emerges at retail level in the trade thus reversing the 18 years of damage done by the Order.</P>
    <P>The removal of the Groceries Order will stimulate competition, drive increased efficiencies at all levels of the distribution chain and eliminate the fixing of minimum retail prices by suppliers. This will create a downward pressure on grocery prices from which consumers will benefit.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Competition Authority to closely monitor this process &mdash; not least to ensure that the benefits of removing the Order are not thwarted by the emergence of other anti-competitive practices. That is why for example the Competition Act 2006 prohibits practices such as resale price maintenance, which were institutionalised by the Order. It would be very damaging to consumer interests if such practices were to emerge within the grocery trade in another guise.</P>
    <P>My officials have had some preliminary discussions with the Authority in this regard and will meet them regularly as the process develops. I have also asked the Authority to report periodically on the results of their monitoring and to make any recommendations they consider appropriate in the light of their findings.</P>

I have also confined my response to briefings made by my Department&rsquo;s Officials to members of the Oireachtas other than myself and the two Ministers of State at my Department.</P>
    <P>In May 2005, officials of my Department attended two briefings which were given to opposition party members on the proposed Landlord &amp; Tenant Bill. The first briefing was held with Fine Gael &amp; Sinn F&eacute;in and the second briefing was held with Fine Gael, Labour, the Green <Col N="204"/>Party and Sinn F&eacute;in. Both briefings were held in my D&aacute;il Office.</P>
    <P>In November 2005, an official of my Department attended a meeting with the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 93, 99 and 122 together.</P>
    <P>The National Employment Survey, which is conducted by the Central Statistics Office, pro<Col N="205"/>vides more detailed comparisons than previously available of employees&rsquo; earnings. This Survey is a valuable source of information and will help in the consideration and development of policies in the relevant areas.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Primary responsibility for policy in relation to equal pay is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is, however, a multifaceted task involving a number of Government Departments. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment undertakes the following actions.</P>
    <P>The National Framework Committee on Work/Life Balance Policies, which is chaired by the Department, undertakes a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work/life balance arrangements at the level of the enterprise. The committee&rsquo;s activities include the provision of financial assistance to organisations, information dissemination activities, seminars, and research activities.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the national minimum wage has also had an impact in addressing the gender pay gap. In this regard, I accepted the Labour Court recommendation and increased the <Col N="206"/>minimum wage to &euro;7.65 per hour with effect from 1 May 2005. Furthermore, the new Social Partnership agreement provides for a further adjustment to the minimum wage with effect from 1 January, 2007.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Expanding the Workforce&rdquo;, which is run by F&Aacute;S, is aimed at proactively encouraging women to return to work. The initiative facilitates women returnees by ensuring that training is provided in a flexible manner and is tailored to meet business requirements and skills needs of employers.</P>

     <Quest>the timeline and content of the Government&rsquo;s proposed research and innovation strategy and the material contribution it will make to reach the target set by the EU&rsquo;s Lisbon Strategy of increasing economy-wide research and development spending to 2.5 per cent of gross national product by 2013.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23950/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government launched its Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-13 on Sunday morning last and copies of the Strategy have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The timeline of the Strategy is an eight-year one, to 2013 and resources of &euro;192 million up to and including 2008 have been provided to enable work on delivering the Strategy to commence with immediate effect.</P>
    <P>Advancing the knowledge economy and building world class people and enterprises with the drive and resources to succeed are among the key pillars of the Strategy which covers all sectors in which research, technology development and innovation have a role to play. The Strategy sets out a vision for Ireland as &ldquo;internationally renowned for the excellence of its research by 2013, to the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture&rdquo;. It then clearly identifies the challenges ahead and the <Col N="212"/>practical steps which we need to take to deliver on this vision.</P>
    <P>The Strategy clearly identifies how we should develop a world class research system. This will involve us doubling the number of PhDs, addressing the need to capture, protect and commercialise knowledge generated from publicly funded and collaborative research, and providing supports and encouragement for industry to dramatically grow expenditure on R&amp;D to &euro;2.5bn per annum by 2013. It tackles the need to promote science as a subject and a career choice among our young people and the need to give teachers the skills to do this. It also covers the whole range of research-performing sectors and focuses on the, potential in areas like health, agri-food and forestry, energy, marine and environment and the potential synergies between these sectors. It also underlines the importance to Ireland of international collaboration and enhanced cooperation on STI issues on the island of Ireland. The aim is to demonstrate clearly that Ireland is an excellent place to do world class research.</P>
    <P>Targets and indicators in respect of the key issues have to be set out in the Strategy. These will continue to be monitored and fine-tuned as necessary, under the direction of the Cabinet Committee on STI which I chair. This ongoing monitoring will ensure that the important whole of Government approach adopted in preparation is maintained throughout the period of delivery of the Strategy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the EU&rsquo;s Lisbon agenda target for expenditure on R&amp;D, Ireland will continue to <Col N="213"/>make a valuable contribution to the attainment of these goals over the period to 2013. The aim is that the implementation of the Strategy will result in the achievement of a spend of 2.5% of GNP by the public and private sector by 2013. The progress in this direction will be monitored throughout the period.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As none of the existing sectoral regulators come within my remit as Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment, this is not a matter for which I have any direct responsibility. Having said that, I have no plans to establish a single national regulator.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that our national system of regulation encourages and promotes competition within the economy and that individual regulators recognise such objectives as an important national priority. Indeed, in this regard I am aware that the Competition Authority has already Co-operation Agreements in place with many of the existing sectoral regulators.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that the scope of a single regulator would be too broad and that as a consequence speedy decision making would be hampered. Furthermore, the trend internationally is away from the concept of a consolidated regulator towards a sectoral approach.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 84, 90, 118 and 121 together.</P>
    <P>The General Scheme of the new Company Law Consolidation and Reform Bill is being drafted making use of an advisory body, the Company Law Review Group (CLRG), which is representative of business, regulators, professional bodies and social partners. The General Scheme has been drafted on the basis of a standing consultation process. The outline of the Scheme and the individual Heads are posted on the website of the CLRG for comment by any interested party. These draft Heads are updated on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>The relationships governed by company law are those between a company&rsquo;s officers, shareholders and creditors and it is not proposed to change this emphasis. Obligations arising from employment and environmental law are dealt with appropriately in those respective codes. It is recognised however that at present many of the duties of a company director exist in case law rather than company law. The opportunity will be taken in the new Bill to set out, on a non-exhaustive basis, the main duties of directors.</P>
    <P>How any company structures its Board is a matter to be addressed by an individual company and may be provided for in that company&rsquo;s articles of association. It is not the intention to restrict this power in the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>The simplification focus of the proposed Bill will particularly benefit small companies as it <Col N="215"/>should reduce their compliance costs. An immediate concrete expression of our concern to assist the viability of small businesses is that arising from the Report of the Small Business Task Force. I am fast-tracking separate legislation to raise the audit exemption limit applying to small companies to the maximum permissible under EU law. I anticipate taking the General Scheme of the overall Company Law Consolidation and Reform Bill to Government for agreement to draft the Bill proper later this year.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that there is a disproportionately high level of fatal injuries in the workplace among non-Irish nationals is a cause of considerable concern both to me as Minister for Labour Affairs and to the Health and Safety Authority, the State body charged with overall responsibility for administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. A total of 9 non-Irish national worker fatalities occurred in Ireland in 2005 and to date in 2006 4 non-Irish national worker fatalities have occurred.</P>
    <P>A lack of clear communication and of understanding in any workplace could potentially pose a risk to the health and safety of the workers therein. It is clear that in the construction sector there are many workers who do not have English as a first language and, accordingly it is appropriate that employers and those who are in control of workplaces in this country put in place clear systems of communication to ensure that all safety critical information is conveyed clearly to all workers in the workplace. The Health and <Col N="218"/>Safety Authority has called on all employers to ensure they are adequately communicating the risks and providing appropriate safety training.</P>
    <P>There is legislation in place specifying information requirements in workplaces and the Health and Safety Authority recognises the new challenges that the growth of non-Irish nationals within the workforce brings and is taking steps to assist those in workplaces to meet those challenges. Section 9 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 sets out the type of information on safety health and welfare required to be given by employers to employees. It specifies that the information must be in a form, manner and language that can be understood. It must include information on hazards, risks and measures taken as regards safety, health and welfare and the names of emergency staff and safety representatives.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under section 20 of the 2005 Act, an employer is obliged to prepare a written safety statement, based on the identification of hazards and an assessment of risks. This statement must also be in a form and language that can be understood.</P>

The matter has been referred for advice on the legal issues arising. A decision will be made on the application as soon as possible.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 104 and 123 together.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its report on corporate killing in October 2005 recommended that as the current law of corporate liability for manslaughter does not provide a clear basis for constructing liability, a new basis, in legislative form, is necessary. The Commission also recommended that there should be individual statutory liability for managers who were culpable in the causation of death.</P>
    <P>At the time of the drafting by the Department of a Bill, which ultimately became the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was consulted on the matter of corporate killing and its appropriateness in an occupational safety Bill. That office was of the opinion that there were much broader <Col N="220"/>issues than safety, health and welfare at work relating to the overall criminal justice system which needed to be considered, as legislating in the relatively confined area of occupational safety and health would omit other sectors where such an offence could be committed. Therefore it was decided that it was not appropriate to deal with the issue of corporate killing in a Bill which was providing for the law and regulation of occupational safety, health and welfare.</P>
    <P>The matter of consideration of the recommendations in the report of the Law Reform Commission is one for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of his main responsibilities for the criminal law system. This Department has not had discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the matter. The matter is dealt with as far as practicable in the 2005 Act under Section 80 which provides for directors, managers or other similar officer of an undertaking to be held liable by the Courts for an offence that is attributable to connivance or neglect on their part.</P>

     <Quest>if, in order to enable the Labour Inspectorate to meet the needs of a changing workforce and the specific difficulties faced by migrant workers he will ensure affirmative action is taken in order that a proportion of the inspectors are from these communities; and if, failing same, he will ensure that a proportion of all new inspectors employed are proficient in foreign languages relevant to where the majority of the migrant workers are from.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The enforcement of Employment Rights Compliance is primarily based around the legislative provisions governing the statutory records that employers are required to maintain. The generality of investigative work undertaken by Labour Inspectors does not require that they be competent in a variety of languages. Where the need for interpretation services are required, such as in the area of Statement taking or the translation of documents, the Inspectorate has adequate access to a panel of competent individuals who can provide the services necessary in a very broad range of languages.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that the Labour Inspectorate can, and is, discharging its remit I am equally aware that there are undoubted new and growing challenges arising out of the changing nature of the workforce and economic development. In this regard, I am confident that the proposals for enhancements to the Employment Rights Compliance regime, as agreed with the Social Partners in the new National Agreement, will enable the <Col N="221"/>Labour Inspectorate to manage that evolving remit most effectively.</P>
    <P>In the context of other commitments undertaken in the recent Social Partnership talks a major Education and Awareness programme dealing with all aspects of Employment Rights entitlements and obligations will be delivered over the period of the Agreement. While both employers and employees generally will be targeted in the programme a particular feature of this initiative will be a focus on dissemination of Employment Rights information to workers from overseas.</P>
    <P>The Employment Rights Information Unit (ERIU) produces a range of materials, e.g. information leaflets and booklets that provide a condensed and simplified version of the large corpus of Employment Rights legislation that is currently on the Statute Books. With particular regard for the needs of workers from overseas the Department has translated key Employment Rights information into nine languages and made this available both in leaflet form and on the Department&rsquo;s website. This information is available in the following languages; Chinese, Czech, English, Hungarian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian and Russian. The Employment Rights Information Unit distributes thousands of information leaflets and booklets either directly to applicants, through the nation-wide network of citizen information centres and other outlets.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I met with Minister Eagle on 1 June at InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s offices in Newry. This was my first opportunity to meet with Minister Eagle since her recent appointment as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement gave a new impetus to North/South economic co-operation and led to the establishment of the North/South Implementation Bodies. InterTradeIreland, the all-island body responsible for co-ordinating work on North/South trade and business development, is co-sponsored by my Department and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Minister Eagle and I were briefed by the Chairman and Chief Executive of InterTradeIreland on the Body&rsquo;s current programmes and activities and its overall strategy to enhance the development of the all-island economy. InterTradeIreland is supporting a wide range of actions that <Col N="222"/>offer businesses the opportunity to address a larger all-island market and to engage in inter-firm co-operation. Its key strategic objective is to increase the number, effectiveness and value of all-island trade and business development networks. All-island business networks allow firms to share resources, to gain knowledge and expertise, to partner with research institutions, to achieve economies of scale and to open new market opportunities. The work of InterTradeIreland is an example of the practical benefits accruing from cooperation. The Government is committed to supporting the work of the North/South Bodies and to seeing them realise their full potential.</P>
    <P>Minister Eagle and I also reviewed progress on the comprehensive study to identify areas for further co-operation in the development of the all-island economy. This study, which was announced recently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify and take forward new initiatives. The study is being carried out under the direction of key policy Departments, North and South, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. InterTradeIreland is providing the secretariat for the study and is working closely with relevant Departments, agencies and business interests, North and South. A progress report will be submitted to the next meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>At our meeting Minister Eagle and I gave our full commitment to the North West Gateway Initiative, which will provide a strategic action plan to further develop the North West region of the island of Ireland. Both Governments are committed to a joint approach to the development of the North West, that is focused on enterprise development, employment, skills, spatial planning and infrastructure.</P>

    <P>In launching the report of the Small Business Forum last month I indicated that the Forum had presented me with a comprehensive set of proposals which were designed to enable the small business sector to achieve its full potential and to enhance the significant contribution which the sector already makes to the economic well-being of this country.</P>
    <P>I confirmed that I would be seeking to implement all the recommendations that fall within my Department&rsquo;s remit and that I would be working closely with my Government colleagues to look at an implementation path for the remaining recommendations which do not fall within my area of responsibility. My Department has commenced its detailed deliberations on the appropriate means to implement the relevant recommendations, including consultations with relevant agencies. I am confident that significant progress will be made in respect of implementation by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As I also promised when launching the report, I have now invited the members of the Forum to remain in place to act as a body to review the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and progress in achieving the report&rsquo;s core objectives and I am confident that this will ensure consistent and thorough follow-up and timely implementation of the various recommendations.</P>

     <Quest>his views on whether the level of fines for failure to properly display prices are adequate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Price display law is covered by Orders made under Section 19 of the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 and under the European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002, Statutory Instrument No. 639 of 2002. The various Price Display Orders made under the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 cover Drinks Display in Licensed Premises, Hairdressing Services, Petrol and Diesel and Restaurants. The European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 requires retailers to display the selling and where appropriate the unit price (the price per litre or kilo) for all products covered by the scope of the Regulations.</P>
    <P>The fine for a summary conviction under all of the above legislation is &euro;3,000. I recently increased the maximum fine for a summary conviction under the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 to this level under Part 7 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 where I took the opportunity to increase the level <Col N="224"/>of fines for a range of consumer law some of which had remained unchanged since the 1970s.</P>
    <P>There is therefore a uniform maximum fine of &euro;3,000 for summary convictions of price display law, both domestic and EU. However it is for a Court to decide the amount of any fine taking into account the facts of a specific case.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the level of fines for offences involving price display infringements is satisfactory. However I am keeping the situation under review and in the legislation I propose introducing this year to establish the new National Consumer Agency and to transpose the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC) I will explore the possibility of increasing the fine for a summary conviction for the consumer legislation to be covered by this legislation.</P>
    <P>I would, however, point out that convictions under the legislation are not the only method of ensuring compliance. The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs whose function it is to enforce consumer laws, regularly undertakes surveillance with a view to securing voluntary compliance on the part of traders.</P>

	<P>The proposal referred to in this Question is an operational matter for Shannon Development and not one in which I have any direct involvement. Shannon Development has entered into an option-to-purchase agreement with Shannon LNG, in relation to 281 acres of the 600-acre Shannon Development owned land bank between Tarbert and Ballylongford, County Kerry. The site, which has been designated by Shannon Development for deep-water projects, is about 25 km from the national gas pipeline grid.</P>
    <P>Under the agreement, Shannon LNG, an Irish subsidiary of Hess LNG Limited, a 50/50 joint venture of Hess Corporation and Poten &amp; Partners, is proposing to build a &euro;400 million liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal on the Shannon Development owned land bank on the Shannon Estuary. The Tarbert/Ballylongford site is considered suitable for deep-water projects, and Shannon Development has accordingly actively marketed the potential of the site to an international business audience over many years. I understand that the purchase option allows time for the detailed design and appraisal of the proposed project and for full consultation with the relevant authorities and the local community.</P><Col N="225"/>
    <P>The promoters advise that the terminal will provide about 50 long-term permanent jobs, along with additional support jobs and around 350 construction jobs at its peak. Shannon LNG has also indicated that it is fully committed to active communication and consultation with the local community and all interested parties. They anticipate that they will apply for planning permission in a year&rsquo;s time and, subject to planning approval, expect to begin construction work in 2008 with the terminal becoming operational in 2011 at the earliest.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 86 and 119 together.</P>
    <P>The Government places top priority on our economy&rsquo;s ability to compete in the global marketplace. Our commitment to taking forward and quickly progressing implementation of both the Enterprise Strategy Group and Small Business Forum recommendations is evidence of our own resolve to ensure that we can continue to compete effectively in global markets.</P>
    <P>Being one of the world&rsquo;s most open economies has allowed Ireland to prosper for over a decade but also leaves us prone to the pressures of rising external costs. Escalating and inflationary energy costs are a factor every economy is currently facing. Eurostat recently reported a rise in euro zone inflation to 2.5%, and several of our EU partners are dealing with inflation figures considerably higher than our own.</P>
    <P>Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a priority of the Government&rsquo;s economic policy. There are a number of variables, which drive inflation such as oil prices, exchange rates, <Col N="226"/>interest rates and the level of demand in the economy. Not all of these factors are within our control.</P>
    <P>The Government is playing its part in controlling inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies, promoting stronger competition and strengthening consumer protection. In addition, the new Partnership Agreement has reconvened the Anti-Inflation Group to monitor the inflationary threat. The Partnership Agreement also includes proposals to support manufacturing targeted at such key areas as upskilling, R&amp;D and the establishment of a High Level Manufacturing Group to address a broad range of issues affecting Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing sector.</P>

	<P>The details sought in respect of those bodies under the aegis of my Department which have a regulatory function are as follows: The Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB) is the national body with responsibility for accreditation in accordance with the relevant International Organisation for Standardisation ISO 17000 series of standards and guides and the harmonised EN 45000 series of European standards. The INAB provides accreditation of laboratories, certification and inspection bodies, attestors and attestation bodies and is the statutory body responsible for GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) and EMAS (European Eco-Management and Audit Schemes). INAB has 11 members of staff.</P>
    <P>The Legal Metrology Service is a statutory body within the National Standards Authority of Ireland. Under the Metrology Acts 1980 to 1998 it exercises regulation making and control functions with regard to measurements, in particular those used for the purpose of trade. There are currently 27 employees.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies is a statutory independent office responsible for the registration of Industrial and Provident Societies, Friendly Societies and Trade Unions, to ensure that various societies and trade unions comply with their statutory obligations and the provision of accurate information to the public about the affairs of Societies and trade unions supervised by the Registry. There is ten staff assigned to the Office.</P>
    <P>The Companies Registration Office is the statutory authority responsible for ensuring the filing of returns under the Companies Acts, provision of public access to accurate company information, the issue of certificates of incorporation <Col N="227"/>for new companies, the maintenance of a register of mortgages and charges and the registration of business names and limited partnerships. There is currently 150 staff assigned to the CRO.</P>
    <P>The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority was established pursuant to the provisions of Part 2 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act, 2003 to supervise the regulation by the accountancy bodies of their members. The Authority currently has eight employees, including one temporary staff member.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement was established in 2001 and is responsible for encouraging compliance with the Companies Acts and investigating and enforcing suspected breaches of the legislation.

    <P>The Irish Takeover Panel, established by the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, is the statutory body responsible for monitoring and supervising takeovers and other relevant transactions in Ireland. The Panel has a total of five employees.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs was established under the Consumer Information Act, 1978. The Director is an independent statutory officer, responsible for enforcing a wide spectrum of consumer protection legislation, including the power to seek court orders and to prosecute for breaches of the Consumer Information Act, Consumer Credit, Package Travel, Food and Textile Labelling, Price Display Orders, Product Pricing, Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts and Product Safety legislation. There is 65 staff assigned to the office.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority is an independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State. The Authority currently employs 47 staff.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court provides a comprehensive service for the resolution of disputes about industrial relations, equality, organisation of working time, national minimum wage, part-time work and fixed-term work matters. Some aspects of the Labour Court&rsquo;s responsibilities have a regulatory function, e.g. in relation to Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements. There is 25 staff assigned to the Labour Court, including four shared with the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the national statutory body charged with responsibility for enforcement of occupational safety and health law; the promotion and encouragement of accident prevention; and the provision of information, advice and research. The Authority is a state-sponsored body, established under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, formerly known as the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health (NAOSH). Since <Col N="228"/>the passing in 2005 of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 the Authority&rsquo;s remit is now based on the provisions of that Act. The Authority is the designated interim national competent body for the administration and enforcement of EU chemicals regulation in this country and it is also the national competent authority for the implementation of EU regulations concerning transportable pressure equipment. The Authority&rsquo;s sanctioned staff numbers are 185 for 2006 (including 21 for EU chemicals regulation).</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESRI carry out a monthly employment and vacancies survey for F&Aacute;S. This survey provides very useful up-to-date information on how the labour market is performing. The May survey did show a decline in the number of firms reporting vacancies from 22% to 16%. However, this does not indicate a decline in vacancy activity in the labour market. The previous months figure of 22% was unusually high with the average number of firms reporting vacancies over the last few months at 15%. Thus, the results of the May survey simply show a return to this trend. I understand from F&Aacute;S that there may be seasonal factors underpinning the change between April and May and as yet, there is no firm indication of a contraction in employment or vacancy activity.</P>
    <P>The survey also provides information on employers&rsquo; expectations regarding future employment growth. The May survey indicates that employers expect their current employment levels to remain more or less the same over the next few months. In addition, the most recent Quarterly National Household data issued by the Central Statistics Office shows that the labour force increased by 95,800 to 2,086,500 in the year with the number of persons in employment increasing by 89,800 or 4.7%. This continued strong growth indicates that the Irish labour market remains extremely buoyant.</P>

	<P>The Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal, hearing both sides in a trade dispute. It then issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled. In line with the voluntarist nature of the industrial relations system in this country, Labour Court recommendations for the resolution of trade disputes are not legally binding. However, as the Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, namely the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
    <P>I recently met with a union delegation in relation to this matter and my colleague Minister Martin met both parties and urged them to resolve their differences. However, responsibility for the settlement of a dispute ultimately rests with the parties themselves.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health and Safety Authority carried out a campaign in 2005 which focused on health and safety issues within Local Authorities and, in particular, on roadworks. While most local authorities are in broad compliance with health and safety requirements I understand that some of them would need to do more to demonstrate full compliance.</P>
    <P>A concentrated inspection campaign was instigated during the September 2005 Construction Safety Campaign. The campaign was divided in two distinct focus areas &mdash; namely site inspections and senior manager meetings. The site inspections focused primarily on roadwork activities, whereas the meeting with the senior managers within local authorities focused on their safety <Col N="230"/>management systems and policies for all construction related activities.</P>
    <P>During the course of the campaign inspectors reported on the commitment and willingness of all individuals interviewed. Assurances were offered to inspectors that improvements in health and safety policies and procedures within the Local Authority areas would continue. The Heath and Safety Authority took appropriate enforcement action where necessary during the campaign.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority prepared a report on the campaign detailing the findings and recommendations which was circulated to all Local Authorities. Subsequently, in 2006, the Health and Safety Authority held Seminars for City and County Mangers and are supporting the Local Authorities.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Authority that following on from the campaign the County and City Managers, supported by the Local Government Management Services Board, have made strong commitments to ensure that a robust health and safety management system is put in place and are working with the Health and Safety Authority to this end.</P>

    <P>In the area of pay and conditions, it is primarily the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 that apply to employees who are employed in domestic service. Employees, working in the provision of domestic service, as is the case for employees in most other areas of the economy, are not categorised in any unique fashion in current employment legislation.</P>
    <P>Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the Inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.

	<P>The recently published Expert Group on Future Skills Needs report SME Management Development in Ireland concluded that while there was no evidence that Irish SME managers were less skilled or competent than those in other countries, enhanced capabilities are required to meet future business challenges. It therefore recommended that both the incidence and effectiveness of management development activities be increased and that Ireland move to a situation where all SME principals would be able to identify their own training needs and those of their staff and find cost effective, relevant, development opportunities to meet such needs.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Report found that the majority of owner/managers have not engaged in formal management development. It suggested that much of the existing management development provision may be provider-driven and not sufficiently focused on the real needs of SMEs.</P>
    <P>The Small Business Forum Report also published recently concluded that SME owner/managers would not participate in training unless they see a clear connection between specific programmes and the success of their individual businesses. It concluded that, with the substantial increases in State funding for in-company training over past two years, that resource constraints are not the primary barrier to enhancing management competence.</P>
    <P>The Small Business Forum considered that many owner/managers feel that available training is insufficiently targeted at their needs. They therefore recommended that a Management Development Council be established under the auspices of my Department to ensure targeting is informed directly by business needs.</P>
    <P>I agree with the conclusion that expanding awareness of the value of investment in management training, both in terms of commercial profitability and providing the competencies to meet emerging change and challenges, is central. I am currently considering how this can best be achieved.</P>

The Authority published the Strategy Statement 2006-2008 in March 2006. The Strategy Statement sets out the Authority&rsquo;s objectives for the next three years and its plans on how it proposes to implement those objectives. The Authority states that the focus of its strategy over the next three years is no longer on building capacity but rather about discharging its functions in the most timely, efficient and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>In addition to these various reporting requirements, the Authority Chairperson is obliged to attend, if required, before the Committee on Public Accounts in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report on the Competition Authority&rsquo;s audited accounts. The Authority&rsquo;s Chairperson is also obliged, under Section 38 of the Competition Act, 2002, to attend before any other committee of the Oireachtas, if required.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority, through the Director of Public Prosecutions, has secured fifteen criminal convictions for breaches of competition law so far this year. There are a further five defendants before the courts in relation to this particular case which involved a price fixing cartel in the home heating oil sector in the West of Ireland. To date, fines amounting to &euro;98,000 and one six month prison sentence have been imposed. These are the first criminal convictions on indictment for competition law offences in Ireland and in Europe. The additional resources provided to the Authority this year for its cartel enforcement work will increase the Authority&rsquo;s capacity to investigate and prosecute serious breaches of competition law.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland is not unique in terms of recent employment losses in manufacturing. Employment in manufacturing is falling globally and this trend is not limited to developed countries. ILO and UNIDO employment estimates for key non-OECD countries such as Brazil, China and Russia show that manufacturing employment has also declined in these countries. A recent study cites a net job loss of more than 4 million jobs between 1995 and 2002 in China&rsquo;s manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>This suggests that the decline in manufacturing employment in OECD countries is not solely attributable to a shift of production from OECD to non-OECD countries. While this has certainly played a role for some countries and some industries, an important factor driving the decline in manufacturing employment is productivity growth.</P>
    <P>CSO data indicates that manufacturing production (in volumes) increased by 28 percent between 2000 and 2005. This implies that in recent years more manufacturing goods have been produced by fewer people, indicating that productivity growth has been a contributor to the decline in employment of manufacturing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Also, other factors such as increased offshoring and trade play a role in explaining the decline in manufacturing employment in Ireland in recent years. Offshoring of lower value-added functions <Col N="235"/>is a reality of modern global manufacturing. Offshoring can occur because of increasing cost competitiveness in other locations or because firms need to gain more efficient access to vital markets. Productivity gains achieved through offshoring represent an opportunity to develop higher end manufacturing and related activities domestically, such as R&amp;D, marketing and sales functions.</P>
    <P>The increasing price of oil must be paid for by manufacturers the world over, so this does not place Ireland at a particular competitiveness disadvantage. The issue of cost competitiveness and the health of manufacturing depends on a much wider array of issues, from the availability of suitable skills to the impact of higher wage costs.</P>
    <P>The difficulty being faced by some manufacturing sectors in Ireland is mainly due to shifting patterns of international comparative advantage and the process of structural change, with capital and labour resources of declining firms and industries now being allocated to other higher value-added activities more suited to the new, higher cost, Irish operating environment. While employment within manufacturing has fallen by 31,000 since peaking at 251,000 in 2000 at the same time there has been a large increase in employment in the services and construction sectors. Employment in financial services and other business services grew by almost 100,000 while employment in the construction sector grew by 130,000 since 1997. Overall employment has increased by 500,000 in that period.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the role played by manufacturing and its continuing importance in the Irish economy. To assist industry maintain competitiveness and increase productivity the economic development agencies are working on an ongoing basis to promote the adoption of new technology and best practice at company level. The agencies aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise in Ireland through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, and strong supports for innovation and for research and development. The recently concluded social partnership agreement Towards 2016 also recognises the importance of the manufacturing sector with a proposal to establish a high level manufacturing group.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 124 together.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations on non- agricultural market access, Ireland and EU Member States are asking that all participants contribute according to their means with due regard to their level of development. The EU approach is that developing countries should do less than developed and that the poorest and most vulnerable should make no new market access commitments. It is on this basis that the EU have sought the use of two coefficients in the industrial tariff negotiations. Using a coefficient of 10 for developed countries, in a formula, will deliver final maximum tariffs of no more than 10%. The use of a higher coefficient of 15, in the case of developing countries, would result in developing countries having to reduce their tariffs to a maximum of 15%.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Framework Agreement agreed by WTO Ministers at the General Council, in July 2004, includes elements of flexibility for developing countries which remain subject to negotiation and final agreement. These elements of flexibility include, for example, less than formula cuts on a certain percentage of tariff lines, or keeping tariffs unbound, or not applying formula cuts to a certain percentage of tariff lines, all of which can contribute to developing countries delivering tariff cuts on a basis of less than full reciprocity.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Framework Agreement, adopted by all WTO Members, specifies that least developed countries (LDCs) shall not be required to apply the formula tariff cuts nor participate in the sectorial approach, but that as part of their contribution to the Round of negotiations they are expected to increase their level of binding commitments. In addition, as reflected in the Industrial Goods Market Access Annex of the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, of December 2005, &ldquo;there appears to be a common understanding that LDCs will be the judge of the extent and level of the bindings that they make.&rdquo;</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 102 together.</P>
    <P>I have provided funding of more than &euro;30m to the County and City Enterprise Boards this year. This represents an increase of nearly 8% on the allocation provided in 2005. In addition to the Exchequer funding provided, the CEBs have an increasing flow of funds available to them from repayments of refundable grants provided in earlier years. It is estimated that some &euro;3m will be available to the CEBs in 2006 from this source.</P>
    <P>I believe that the level of funding available to the CEBs is adequate and appropriate at this time and that it enables all CEBs to fulfil their function and their remit in maximizing entrepreneurial development in the micro-enterprise sector throughout the country. The CEBs play an extremely important role in the development of indigenous enterprise in Ireland and it is my intention that an appropriate level of financial support for all CEBs will continue to be made available. I am confident that the level of funding available is sufficient to enable any CEB support any good quality projects that may present.</P><Col N="238"/>
    <P>In determining the allocations for individual CEBs, my Department adopts a systematic approach to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment. This approach involves the provision of funding on the basis of a standard initial allocation to each CEB as well as an additional allocation that is determined mainly by population but which also takes account of issues such as local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread. Furthermore, my Department works closely with the CEBs throughout the year to ensure that the available funding is utilised to the maximum extent possible. This can involve funds being reallocated from Boards that are not in a position to spend their full allocations to Boards that have a demand for additional funding.</P>

	<P>The basic criteria under which the County Enterprise Boards have been operating since their inception in 1993, and under which funding is available, is based primarily on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size or proposed size of the enterprise. CEBs can assist, through either financial or non-financial means, in the establishment and/or development of new and existing enterprises from individuals/sole traders, companies and community groups subject to the following eligibility criteria:</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the enterprise must be in the commercial sphere;</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the enterprise must demonstrate a market for the product/service;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the enterprise must have a capacity for growth and new job creation;</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the enterprise must not employ more than 10 people.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">Within the above eligibility criteria there are certain priorities and restrictions imposed such as the following:</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>priority must be given to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector which over time can develop into strong export entities and <Col N="239"/>graduate to the Enterprise Ireland Portfolio;</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>tourism enterprises must be aimed predominantly at overseas visitors;</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>locally provided enterprises promoted by the unemployed, those recently made redundant and women re-entering the workforce can be supported provided that those enterprises do not give rise to concerns about deadweight or displacement;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>it is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc), construction, as it is considered that these generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>in relation to the provision of financial assistance there has been an increasing recourse to repayable forms of assistance.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">In 2003, my Department, through Forf&aacute;s, commissioned a comprehensive review of the role and functions of the CEBs in the development of micro-enterprises. The Review largely endorsed the activities and operations of the CEBs and concluded that there is justification for continued state support to micro-enterprises and that the CEB network can continue to play a useful role in the overall national enterprise development policy. It also recommended that, in providing assistance to micro-enterprises,</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>CEBs should focus more on economic, rather than social or local development, objectives;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>there should be a renewed focus on the core enterprise mission;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the issues of potential deadweight, displacement and duplication should be more systematically and rigorously addressed and</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>there should be a move away from direct grant aid to repayable finance as well as a greater provision of soft supports as an alternative to grant aid.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">The recent report of the Small Business Forum endorsed the key recommendations of the Fitzpatricks Report in relation to the future focus of CEB support and assistance. My Department is in dialogue with the CEBs in relation to the implementation of these recommendations in an appropriate manner and in relation to determining how best the CEBs can re-focus their supports in line with the recommendations of both the Reports in order to ensure that the eligibility <Col N="240"/>criteria remain fully relevant to current market conditions.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s offices are spread over 8 separate buildings, none of which have cafeterias or restaurants. My Department has only a medium sized canteen in Davitt House and a very small canteen in Kildare Street. As indicated in my reply to a similar question by Deputy McManus last month, the tea, coffee, sugar and other products served in those two canteens are not confined to Fair Trade products which, I understand, is also the position in relation to any canteens, restaurants or cafes of the agencies under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>I have asked that consideration be given to the enhanced sale of Fair Trade tea, coffee, sugar and other products in my Department&rsquo;s two canteens and in those of the agencies under the aegis of my Department but it would not be appropriate to impose an obligation on the proprietors involved to use only Fair Trade products. Since the matter was raised by Deputy Liz McManus last month, I can confirm that the two canteens in my Department have introduced Fair Trade products for sale or are in the process of doing so, which is a development I very much welcome.</P>

	<P>I am conscious of the difficulties sometimes experienced by non-native speakers in understanding their rights and conditions of employment. With particular regard for the needs of employees from overseas the Department has translated key Employment Rights information into nine languages namely Chinese, Czech, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Russian. The information, <Col N="241"/>which is also available in Irish as well as English, can be obtained in leaflet form and from the Department&rsquo;s website. The Employment Rights Information Unit in the Department distributes thousands of information leaflets and booklets through citizen information centres and other outlets around the country.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Statutory employment rights and protections apply to all workers whether they are Irish Citizens or workers from overseas. There is no legal obligation on employers to provide information to employees on the generality of Employment Rights legislation.

    <P>In the context of commitments under the National Partnership Agreement Towards 2016 a structured programme of Education and Awareness in respect of Employment Rights entitlements and obligations is planned.

	<P>The Deputy appears to be referring to a recent speech by Commissioner Mandelson, at Renmin University in Beijing, at which he encouraged China to meet its World Trade Organisation (WTO) obligations or risk a backlash from Europe. I have noted the Commissioner&rsquo;s comments in which he pointed to the need for effective action by China on several WTO fronts including, in respect of Intellectual Property (IP) issues.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that China has made significant strides since joining the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in strengthening its legal framework and amending laws on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to comply with the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).</P>
    <P>Despite these improvements, known IPR infringements, in the form of counterfeiting and piracy, remains a major problem. There remains <Col N="242"/>considerable concern over enforcement measures which to date have not been sufficient to deter IPR infringements effectively. IP in trade terms is not the sole preserve of Member States. The European Commission, on the basis of a mandate from the European Council, negotiates on behalf of EU Member States with Third Country WTO Members. In this regard the EU has recently transmitted a Communication to the WTO TRIPS Council designed to raise the level of awareness of problems regarding effective enforcement.</P>
    <P>In addition the EU has on-going bilateral initiatives with countries, including with China, aimed at improving communication and co-operation on the protection of IPRs and the establishment of a long-term strategy on IPR enforcement supported by EU technical assistance programmes.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as with other EU Member States, supports the EU approach on enforcement. This approach to China, and to other third countries presenting challenges in this regard, is based on the collective trading interests of the EU Member States and on the need to protect our firms&rsquo; IP. The objective of the approach is to improve the legal and institutional and also, the enforcement regimes, in third countries to facilitate trade.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to provide definitive information on proceedings relating to the delay or <Col N="244"/>non-implementation of Directives prior to 2001. However, since 2001, my Department has received 26 notifications (additional to the nine extant notifications in the Table below) from the Commission in respect of the non-transposition of EU Directives. All of the Directives covered by the previous 26 notifications have now been transposed. My Department continues to accord a high priority to the transposition of Directives and makes every effort to transpose Directives in time to meet the deadline given for transposition.</P><Col N="243"/>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Support for job creation and investment in individual counties and regions is a day-to-day operational matter for the development agencies as part of their responsibility under the Industrial Development Acts. While I may give general policy directives to the agencies I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of the national goal of balanced and sustainable regional development is an important goal for my Department and the agencies under its remit. The National Spatial Strategy provides a framework for this goal wherein the focus is on the Gateway and Hub locations throughout the State.</P>
    <P>The agencies under the remit of my Department are endeavouring to attract new investment, encourage the start-up of new businesses, grow existing businesses and develop the labour market in the Western region. The agencies offer supports to prospective and existing employers ranging from mentoring, training and development programmes to employment, research and development grants.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland which is the agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment to this country has set itself a target of trying to achieve 50% of all new Greenfield FDI first time jobs to locate in the BMW region including Galway, Roscommon and Mayo. Where appropriate, IDA utilises the higher grant ceilings available in the BMW Region relative to the rest of the country in order to encourage investment projects to locate within the BMW region. In addition IDA is investing significantly in the provision of planned and focussed property solutions in the West region.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of Enterprise Ireland is to transform Irish companies into market-focused and innovation-driven businesses and to increase their exports, sales and employment. Enterprise <Col N="248"/>Ireland provides preferential funding for companies, with detailed export plans, that are establishing or expanding a business in the West as part of the BMW Region.</P>
    <P>In addition, during 2005, the Galway, Mayo and Roscommon County Enterprise Boards paid out over &euro;1m in grant aid to 113 projects in the Western region and assisted in the creation of 238 net jobs in the area. I am confident that the policies being pursued by the agencies together with the commitment of Government to regional development will continue to bear fruit in terms of investment and employment for the region.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 167 together.</P>
    <P>My Department is required to move 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme. In addition, four of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise as follows: F&Aacute;S is to move 383 posts to Birr, Co. Offaly; Enterprise Ireland is to move 292 posts to Shannon; The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, and The National Standards Authority of Ireland is to move 132 posts to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.</P>
    <P>My Department is required to move 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme. The second iteration of the Department&rsquo;s Decentralisation Implementation Plan, which was submitted to the Department of Finance last year, sets out how the decentralisation programme will be implemented within the Department.</P>
    <P>The number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow, as at 16th May, is 276. The following business units have been earmarked for decentralisation:</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Companies Registration Office / Registry of Friendly Societies</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Work Permits </P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Labour Inspectorate / Employment Rights</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Redundancy &amp; Insolvency</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">Having regard to the Department of Finance agreed staff protocols, my Department has approached all General Service staff who expressed a first preference before 7th September 2004 i.e Priority Applications for relocation to Carlow through the Central Application Facility and there are currently 169 priority first preference applications for Carlow, with good interest across all grades.</P>
    <P>Officials in my Department have analysed the so-called Two to Ten priority applicants &mdash; those who before the 7th September 2004 deadline identified Carlow as their 2nd or subsequent choice. In addition, given that there still remains a deficit in some grades my Department has assessed the post September 2004 CAF applicants, in line with Department of Finance policy. As a result of these trawls we expect to be in a position to fill a further 39 posts.</P>
    <P>My Department currently has 97 Carlow-bound applicants assigned to decentralising posts and we expect to have all decentralising posts filled in sufficient time to ensure that staff are adequately trained in advance of the move to Carlow.</P>
    <P>With regard to the property side of the Department&rsquo;s move, the Office of Public Works completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre late last year. On 31st May 2006, the OPW commenced the tendering process by seeking expressions of interest from developers in relation to the design, build, finance and mainten<Col N="250"/>ance of new office accommodation and car parking for the Department in Carlow.</P>
    <P>On completion of this stage, a short-list of developers will be drawn up from whom tenders will be invited. Following the tender evaluation process the preferred tenderer will be requested to seek suitable planning permission. On obtaining this, the OPW will formally award the contract and construction will commence. The OPW expect construction to begin early in 2007 and the construction phase may take up to 24 months.</P>
    <P>In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are actively exploring the option of an earlier move to Carlow, subject to securing high quality temporary accommodation. This latter option could allow for the movement of approximately 80 decentralising staff to Carlow during the first half of next year, on a voluntary basis. A revised implementation plan will be drawn up by my officials once a decision has been taken on the temporary accommodation available.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to provide advice and support to each of the four Agencies in progressing their decentralisation programmes and there is a dedicated Agency Decentralisation Committee to drive the process forward. In addition, I am satisfied that each Agency is fully engaged in the process and taking all of the relevant steps to advance their decentralisation plans. In outlining the current Agency position on decentralisation, it must be remembered that CAF data is based on priority first preference applications.</P>
    <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, F&Aacute;S is due to transfer its head office including 383 staff to Birr, County Offaly with a target date of 2009. Contracts for the purchase of a site in Birr have been signed. To date, a total of 152 staff have expressed an interest in relocating to Birr, of which 85 are internal F&Aacute;S staff, broken down as follows:</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>14 F&Aacute;S staff have volunteered to move (outside of CAF)</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>6 F&Aacute;S staff have signed up trough the CAF</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>29 New Entrants have signed contracts with the relocation clause</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>36 Promoted staff have signed contracts with the relocation clause, however these cases will be examined by the parties as part of the LRC proposed process.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">With regard to the ongoing dispute between F&Aacute;S and SIPTU in relation to decentralisation, I welcome the fact that an LRC proposal has been accepted by both sides. The proposal provides for the parties to enter a process of discussion, facilitated by the LRC, on the arrangements to apply in respect of promotion in light of the relocation of F&Aacute;S Head Office to Birr. The process should <Col N="251"/>conclude not later than two months from the date of the first meeting, and any unresolved issues at that stage should be referred to the Labour Court for recommendation.</P>
    <P>All the duties/activities carried out in the Head office of F&Aacute;S are scheduled to be transferred to Birr. In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment on this issue, all employees not wishing to transfer out of Dublin will be facilitated with an alternative post in Dublin, and all relevant issues will be discussed with the unions.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is to move 292 posts to Shannon. The most recent CAF figures show that a total of 52 people (of which 19 are internal EI staff) have signalled their interest in moving to Shannon, at this stage. The most immediate implementation step for Enterprise Ireland is to provide for a new HQ building, designed to meet the business needs of the organisation. Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW), has identified but not yet acquired a preferred site in Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny. The Authority has been advised by OPW that as the site procurement is in the final stages, the current timeline for availability for occupancy is late 2008. To date, a total of 62 people (11 HSA staff (including 9 promotions), 41 Civil Servants, 10 Public Servants) have expressed an interest in transferring to Thomastown, through the CAF. In addition, there are 21 staff in the process of being recruited for the REACH Chemicals Strategy. These 21 new recruits, along with four serving staff who wish to move in advance of the Thomastown premises being available, will shortly move to interim accommodation in Kilkenny city.</P>
    <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland, with a total of 132 staff, is to be relocated to Arklow. The latest available CAF figures show a total of 130 first preference priority applications for Arklow (of which 11 are from within the Authority). NSAI are working closely with OPW in identifying and securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area and the NSAI anticipate a target date of April 2009 as the completion date of its decentralisation plan.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Quarterly results need to be interpreted with caution. Quarterly Indices are best compared to performance relative to the corresponding quarter of the previous year rather than relative to the preceding quarter. Furthermore, quarterly indices tend to fluctuate fre<Col N="252"/>quently and should more appropriately be viewed in the context of overall annual performance.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing sector in Ireland continues to perform strongly, both in terms of increasing turnover (monetary value) and production (volumes of units produced). According to the latest CSO Release &mdash; Industrial Production and Turnover (dated 9th June 2006), overall production in 2005 is up 28 percent relative to 2000 in manufacturing industries. While the CSO data indicates that production decreased by 5.3% in the period Feb-April 2006 compared to the period Nov. 2005-Jan. 2006, it should be noted that, on an annual basis, production for manufacturing industries in April 2006 showed an increase of 8.6% over April 2005 with the modern sector, comprising a number of high-technology sectors, showing an annual increase in production to April 2006 of 12.2 percent while an increase of 6.9 per cent was recorded in the Traditional sector.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the role played by manufacturing and its continuing importance to the Irish economy. To assist industry maintain competitiveness and increase productivity the economic development agencies are working on an ongoing basis to promote the adoption of new technology and best practice at company level. The agencies aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise in Ireland through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, and strong supports for innovation and for research and development. The recently concluded social partnership agreement Towards 2016 also recognises the importance of the manufacturing sector with a proposal to establish a high level manufacturing group.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the call for submissions is, firstly, to apply good practice in terms of consulting on this important area impacting on national economic and social issues and on competitiveness and secondly, to collect evidence directly from business and those who deal with businesses about the specific regulatory burdens they face as well as to seek suggestions for pos<Col N="253"/>sible solutions in instances where they perceive regulations to be disproportionate, inefficient or ineffective.

     <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to reports from the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland that a skills shortage is putting foreign direct investment at risk; his Department&rsquo;s views on this claim; the actions being taken by his Department and the discussions his Department has had with other Government Departments in relation to a possible skills shortage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In a tight labour market such as exists in Ireland, it is understandable that there will be some difficulty at times for individual companies in recruiting suitable personnel for their vacancies. However, I think it is valid to claim that in Ireland, more than in most countries, there is a sustained commitment to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the necessary pool of qualified and skilled labour is available and that all reasonable and appropriate steps at Government level are taken to anticipate skills gaps.</P>
    <P>The work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Group has been monitoring our future skills needs since 1997 and much has been done in the interim to ensure awareness of, and responsiveness to, our national skills needs at all levels. The Expert Group is currently undertaking research for my Department to underpin a National Skills Strategy out to 2020.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the National Skills Bulletin in 2005, which is to be published annually by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit under the aegis of the Expert Group and F&Aacute;S, provides a comprehensive picture of the skills demand and supply situation in the economy. The most recent information from this source confirms that there are some shortages of both labour and skills in particular sectors and occupations. That is understandable given the pace of growth across all sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>A particular concern expressed in the American Chamber of Commerce survey relates to fourth level graduates, especially in engineering and finance disciplines. In this regard, I should mention that the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-2013 which was launched earlier this week includes a target of doubling the number of post graduates, many of whom it is expected will be utilised by the enterprise sector.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
     <Quest>the measures he has taken to monitor and respond to the reasons for job losses in view of the 12 per cent increase in redundancies in the first quarter of 2006; and if he intends to formulate employment solutions for vulnerable industries.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23952/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department operates an internal Early Warning System of potential job losses and firms in difficulty, based on material provided on a confidential basis by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. This information includes details as to why each particular situation has developed. While the number of redundancies was higher in the first three months of 2006 than the corresponding months in 2005 this trend has ceased and the number of redundancies in April and May were less than in the same months in 2005.</P>
    <P>Changes in the level of redundancies must be viewed in the context of sustained employment growth. The latest data from the Quarterly National Household Survey for Quarter 1 2006 shows that employment increased by 89,800 (4.7%) to 1,998,100 in the year while the rate of unemployment continues to be low by both international and historical standards at 4.2%. In addition, the latest F&Aacute;S/ESRI job vacancy data indicates that the demand for labour remains strong. This indicates that the Irish labour market remains extremely buoyant, with job creation far exceeding job losses.</P>
    <P>Where redundancies occur, the State agencies under the aegis of my Department (F&Aacute;S, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA) endeavour to find alternative employment for those involved. In addition, to the existing initiatives aimed at low skilled workers and workers in vulnerable industries there are proposals outlined in the new social partnership agreement which provide for a number of initiatives aimed at workers in vulnerable industries. These include enhanced programmes to upskill the low-skilled, older workers and those in vulnerable employment and the establishment of a High Level Working Manufacturing Group which will review the challenges facing the sector and identify further measures to meet those challenges.</P>

I should point out that the more reliable indicator of redundancies relates to those people who have actually been made redundant during the same period. The number for the first five months of this year is 9933 an increase of 6.6% over the same period last year. It is not possible to say at this stage what the final tally will be by year-end.</P>

	<P>A range of dental services for adult medical card holders are available under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) from participating dentists holding contracts with Health Service Executive (HSE). The treatments provided include examinations, fillings, extractions, dentures and x-rays. The scheme is administered by the HSE &mdash; Primary Care Reimbursement Service on behalf of the HSE and it is monitored at a local level by Principal Dental Surgeons with a regional responsibility for the DTSS.</P>
    <P>A DTSS Review Group has been established to undertake a comprehensive review of Primary Care Oral Health Services provided under the DTSS. Represented on the Review Group are the HSE, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Finance, the Irish Dental Association and the HSE Employers Agency. The schedule of services provided for under the DTSS will be examined as part of the review, as well as monitoring and evaluation procedures.</P>

	<P>Last week I formally launched a new Strategy for Cancer Control which has been developed by the National Cancer Forum. The Strategy makes recommendations in relation to organisation, governance, quality assurance and accreditation across the continuum of cancer care from prevention and health promotion through to treatment services, palliative care and research.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to significant additional investment in cancer control based on the reform programme now being implemented by the HSE. Additional investment will be addressed from within the annual financial allocation approved by Government commencing in 2007. To this end, I have asked the HSE to prepare a robust needs assessment for cancer control for the next five years to reflect priorities in cancer control, equitable distribution and priority setting that maximises efficiency and reduces dependancy on hospital in-patient care.</P>
    <P>The HSE has announced the establishment of a National Cancer Control Programme to implement the new Strategy, details of which will be outlined by the Executive over the coming weeks. The Programme will provide the necessary leadership, governance and integration to create an essential framework for cancer control. It will be led by a National Programme Director and will host a single national budget for all cancer control activities. Since the implementation of the National Cancer Strategy commenced in <Col N="260"/>1997, approximately &euro;920 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. The Vote for the Health Service Executive in 2006 includes a sum of &euro;9 million to continue to meet the additional service pressures in cancer care, improve the quality of care, facilitate better access to radiation oncology services and to continue the preparation for the national cervical screening programme.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has issued interim guidelines in respect of the administration of patient private property accounts, in advance of the issue of final guidelines following the enactment of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill 2006. These guidelines standardise the operation of these accounts throughout the HSE.</P>
    <P>Following the death of a patient there is a legal obligation on the HSE to ensure that any funds held on behalf of the patient are preserved for the beneficiaries of the patients&rsquo; estates. Patients&rsquo; funds can be released to the administrator of an estate on production of the letters of administration issued by the Probate Office. In instances where, having made all reasonable enquiries, the HSE is advised that there is no will and no intention to seek formal appointment of an administrator, the HSE may pay out patient funds where the balance held is less than &euro;15,000. In such instances payment will be made to the next of kin, on production of the required documentation and following consultation with a solicitor acting on behalf of the HSE, in accordance with the succession act.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the placing of a person in a private nursing home is a private matter between the person or his or her representatives and the nursing home proprietor, as are the fees charged in these facilities. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 allows for the payment of a subvention towards the cost of such care based on a medical and means assessment. The process used in determining a person&rsquo;s eligibility for subvention is set out <Col N="261"/>in the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993. The repayment scheme for charges for publicly funded residential long term care does not apply to individuals in private nursing homes who pay the full cost of private nursing home care or who have entered these homes under the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme.</P>

The Bill has now been forwarded to the President for signing into law. This Bill provides a clear legal framework for a scheme to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term care.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) are in the process of announcing the appointment of a preferred service provider to administer this repayment scheme. On appointment the company will immediately begin work on the scheme to ensure that a significant proportion of patients will receive their repayments within a short period. The company will, within four weeks of appointment, begin to issue application forms and begin notifying approximately 7,600 living patients of the amount of repayment due to them.</P>
    <P>The HSE has indicated that the details of these repayments have been prepared in advance of the appointment of the company. On submission of an application and receipt of notification of the calculated amount of repayment due, the applicant will have a period of 28 days in which to appeal or reject the calculated amount of repayment due prior to the issuing of money by the HSE.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Life Assurance Directive 2002/83/EC is effectively a consolidation of Directive 79/267/EEC (First Life Directive), Directive 90/619/EEC (Second Life Directive) and Directive 92/96/EEC (Third Life Directive). The original Directives were transposed into law by the European Communities (Life Assurance) Regulations, 1984 (S.I. No. 57 of 1984) and by the European Communities (Life Assurance) Framework Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 360 of 1994). Therefore, no further transposition was required for the provisions of the early Directives that were consolidated into Directive 2002/83/EC because these already existed in Irish law. However, Directive 2002/83/EC contained new updated solvency requirements and these were transposed by the European Communities (Life Assurance) Framework (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2004 (S.I. No. 729 of 2004). My Department is not aware of any problems with the transposition of the Life Assurance Directive.</P>
    <P>In May this year, the Commission was in touch with my Department seeking certain details <Col N="264"/>about the transposition process. My Department provided the details required to the satisfaction of the Commission. The Insurance Mediation Directive (2002/92/EC) was transposed into Irish law on 13 January 2005 by way of Statutory Instrument No. 13 of 2005. A number of representations were subsequently made to my Department in relation to certain technical drafting issues arising from the transposition of the Directive. These have been examined carefully by my Department in consultation with industry representatives and I expect to be in a position to bring forward revised Regulations shortly.</P>
    <P>In November 2005, the Department received a query in quite general terms from the European Commission regarding the way in which we had transposed the IMD. The Department replied that Ireland had met the transposition deadline but that the domestic industry had subsequently identified some technical difficulties with our transposing legislation, that we had been in consultation with them with a view to resolving these difficulties and that this was likely to necessitate an amendment to our original transposing S.I. In response the Commission asked to be kept informed of developments.</P>
    <P>In April 2006 we received a further letter from the Commission asking us to clarify certain issues in our original transposing Regulations. These queries were of a routine nature and, indeed, referred to some of the issues which were identified in the consultation exercise and which it is intended to address in the revised Regulations.</P>

	<P>Wind energy projects are currently supported on a community and commercial scale. Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has published a study on the metering options for Small Scale Renewable electricity and Combined Heat and Power Generation (CHP) in Ireland. The study identified a number of areas which require further analysis including the ability of such processes to secure adequate payment for their exports; connection standards and processes for smaller generators, and the implications of the single electricity market for small-scale electricity generation. SEI is commissioning work to address these issues in 2006 <Col N="267"/>and this will inform further policy decisions in relation to domestic wind turbines.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 155 together.</P>
    <P>Ireland only ratifies ILO Conventions where we can accept every single provision with which our legislation is fully in conformity. This also allows for absolute compliance. In adopting Conventions, the ILO operates by way of a double discussion procedure whereby proposals for International Labour Standards are discussed over two successive years at the annual International Labour Conference which is held in Geneva in June.</P>
    <P>ILO Conventions have the status of International Treaties, and as such are subject to ratification, whereas ILO Recommendations, which mostly cover the same issues as Conventions, are more aspirational in nature and do not have to be <Col N="269"/>ratified by Member States. The choice between favouring a Convention or favouring a Recommendation is dictated not so much by the content of the proposed standard, but influenced by whether the Government sees it appropriate to legislate in order to achieve the desired end. To ratify a Convention may require legislation, whereas a Recommendation can be put into effect through a change in policy without necessarily going through the legislative route. The fact that Ireland has not ratified a particular Convention does not mean that we do not have in place effective and up-to-date legislation and enforcement mechanisms relating to the sector in question i.e. such legislation tends to reflect an approach developed within a broader EU framework.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Conventions referred to in the Questions, the position is that Departments have not confirmed conformity with the following Conventions:</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Convention 167 and associated Recommendation 175 concerning Safety and Health in Construction, 1988</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Convention 168 and associated Recommendation 176 concerning Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment, 1988</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Convention 171 and associated Recommendation 178 concerning Night Work 1990</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Convention 174 and associated Recommendation 181 concerning the Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents, 1993.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">I am pleased to state that Ireland is ready to ratify Convention 184 and to adopt the associated Recommendation 192 concerning Safety and Health in Agriculture, 2001. I will bring proposals in this regard to Government and place the associated White Paper before both Houses in the near future. I should also point out, that in 2005, the Health and Safety Authority signed up to the ILO&rsquo;s Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems (ILO-OSH 2001). These Guidelines promote a management systems approach to safety and health at work and were developed in the tripartite ILO system. A growing number of countries have already signed up to these Guidelines.</P>

	<P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children and F&Aacute;S, has commissioned Indecon International Economic Consultants to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of contracted vocational and rehabilitative training services for people with disabilities. The study will make recommendations on the appropriateness and effectiveness of current levels of State funding and the extent to which it is positively impacting on the vocational advancement of programme participants and compare training services provided for people with disabilities with similar types of training available nationally and internationally. This comparison will address costs, training duration, the outcomes achieved for the different types of training courses, and delivery methods relating to both vocational training and rehabilitative training.</P>
    <P>The cost of the review is &euro;152,599, inclusive of VAT, and is being shared by the three commissioning parties as above indicated. The recommendations to be made by the consultants will provide a basis for improved financial and operational transparency. They will also facilitate the progressive improvement of training services that are resourced from public funds for people with disabilities. The three items referred to by the Deputy relate to the achievement of quality accreditation rather than reviews and as such are not duplicated by the current review.</P>

	<P>Section 14(4) (as amended) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 provides that where an employee is dismissed, the employer shall, if requested, provide particulars in writing of the principal grounds for dismissal to the employee within 14 days of the request.</P>
    <P>However, the Unfair Dismissals Acts generally do not apply to employees with less than one year&rsquo;s continuous service, with certain exceptions. These are:</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>an employee&rsquo;s pregnancy, giving birth or breastfeeding or any matters connected therewith;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the exercise or proposed exercise by an employee of a right under the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004;</P><Col N="271"/>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the exercise or contemplated exercise by an employee of the right to adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave under the Adoptive Leave Acts 1995 and 2005;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the exercise or proposed exercise by the employee of the right to parental leave or force majeure leave under and in accordance with the Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2006;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>an employee&rsquo;s entitlements, future entitlements, exercise or proposed exercise of rights under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000;</P>

    <P el="5" FLI="0">When determining if an employee has the necessary service to qualify under the Acts, a Rights Commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, may consider whether the employment of a person on a series of two or more contracts of employment, between which there were no more than 26 weeks of a break, was wholly or partly for or connected with the avoidance of liability by the employer under the Acts. Where it is so found, the length of the various contracts may be added together to assess the length of service of an employee for eligibility under the Acts.</P><Col N="272"/>
    <P>Employees with less than one year&rsquo;s service, and who do not qualify under any of the above exceptions, may consider availing of a mechanism under the Industrial Relations Act 1969 whereby the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission may investigate disputes and grievances (including matters associated with dismissal) which are referred to them by individuals or small groups of workers. Having carried out an investigation, a Rights Commissioner issues a recommendation giving his/her opinion on the merits of the dispute. The matter may then be appealed to the Labour Court or, alternatively, the matter can be heard by the Labour Court in the first instance under certain conditions. It is important to note that the recommendations made by the Rights Commissioners and/or Labour Court under this process are not legally enforceable.</P>

	<P>Inward investment into Ireland by foreign companies has played a critical role in the performance of the Irish economy over the last two decades, and our ability to attract the world&rsquo;s leading firms will continue to be an important aspect of our future prosperity. In this respect, Ireland has many reasons to be optimistic for the future. IDA Ireland recently announced strong results for 2005, with the successful nego<Col N="272"/>tiation of 71 new business projects with new and existing clients, involving a total investment over the coming years of more than &euro;760 million. The IDA reported a net gain of jobs of 3,412, the highest net gain since 2000.</P>
    <P>Of course, with an economy characterised by very high employment levels, the quality of jobs is increasingly a more important measure of Ireland&rsquo;s success in attracting FDI than the number of jobs. As such, it is encouraging that of the jobs created, half were very high quality, requiring third-level or higher qualifications, covering a range of disciplines. The IDA also report that this strong performance is continuing into 2006.</P>
    <P>In recent years this Government has been placing a greater emphasis on the development of indigenous companies, to ensure that our econ<Col N="273"/>omic prosperity is built on as wide an enterprise base as possible. We continue to make significant efforts to enhance our framework competitive conditions, and to develop new areas of competitive advantage, such as by developing our R&amp;D base as envisaged in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation. Our focus is on the creation of new jobs which are concentrated in high value added, knowledge based companies that offer greater security in the face of intense international competition. To this end, the enterprise development agencies have been mandated to work with companies to develop management capabilities, workforce skills, capacity for innovation and for research and development, to build productivity and to support the development of strategies for market entry, development and growth.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 166 together.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s success as an open market economy depends on its export performance. The seasonally adjusted NCB Purchasing Mangers&rsquo; Index for May shows the best figures for Irish manufacturing since July 2004 with strong growth in new orders and output, particularly for exports. Indeed, May saw the highest rate of export orders growth in Ireland for six years. This is in the wider context of an economy that has seen its goods and services exports grow eightfold in fifteen years.</P>
    <P>The Government is working successfully with business to promote competitive Irish exports. I have given a strong mandate to Enterprise Ireland to drive the transformation of its client base as the agency&rsquo;s new corporate strategy is aligned with the needs of Irish business in a competitive and global economy.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is achieving both rapid and tangible progress in accelerating the capacity of its clients to enter export markets and their success in winning business. In 2005, export sales from Enterprise Ireland clients rose by 7.2% to &euro;10.7 billion. Of this an impressive &euro;1.25 billion came from an increase in new exports, an indication both of the success of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s policies and of growing competitiveness and indigenous sector strength. Despite the challenges in terms of new competition and lower <Col N="274"/>costs coming from Asian economies, EI&rsquo;s clients grew their exports to this region by almost 15% last year. This suggests that Irish firms are competitive in those markets where we are building competitive advantage in terms of skill, innovation and high value products and services. The overall impressive export performance was supported by EI streamlining its overseas network, in line with the Enterprise Strategy Group&rsquo;s Action Plan to improve support for Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>The level of industrial costs is of particular concern to this Government. Some costs, such as interest rates, fuel prices and the high demand for raw materials in Asia, are not under the direct control of Government. However, the Government is examining how to alleviate industrial costs in other areas. I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the recently concluded Social Partnership negotiations where, pending formal ratification by the parties involved, it has been decided to re-establish the Anti Inflation Group and to set up a High Level Manufacturing Group. These will work towards creating a better competitive environment for our exporters.</P>

	<P>The table provides details of the top 10 EU and non-EU countries for which Ireland has had the most favourable trade balance, in descending order, in respect of each of the years 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Based on the table it can be seen that there has been a considerable degree of consistency in regard to the list of countries with which Ireland has had the most favourable trade balance over the past five years, in both the EU and non-EU categories. For example, Belgium, France, Germany Italy and the Netherlands have regularly featured in the first five EU countries with the most favourable trade balance, whereas elsewhere, in the non-EU category, the USA, Switzerland, Australia, Hong Kong and Mexico have tended to predominate during the five year period.</P>
    <P>It is notable also that in 2001 Ireland had a favourable trade balance with China but, since then, the growth of Chinese exports to Ireland has created a trade deficit with China at a ratio of approximately 3:1. Although Irish exports to China are growing at a significant rate, imports from China are growing at a faster rate due to the phenomenal growth of the Chinese economy.</P>
    <P>At the macro level, however, Ireland has for many years now been in the fortunate position of having an external trade surplus, and latest figures for 2005 indicate a trade surplus of &euro;31.6 billion. Against the continuing background of a <Col N="275"/>difficult global trading environment, therefore, I consider that Irish exporters have performed extremely well and are well poised to take advantage of an expected upturn in world trading conditions, going forward.</P>

	<P el="0">Figures are not available for overall numbers of enterprises established in the economy over the last three years. The performance of the enterprise development agencies, however, gives an indication of the relative strength of the economy. From 2003 to 2005, 2,025 new start-up projects were approved for grant assistance by the County and City Enterprise Boards. Of these 724 start-ups were approved for assistance in 2003, 618 in 2004 and 683 in 2005. (Grant approval does not always indicate a viable subsequent start-up, so these figures should only be taken as indicative).</P>
    <P>In 2005, Enterprise Ireland supported the establishment of 75 new export-focused high potential companies, which had a total investment of &euro;83m (Enterprise Ireland approved funding of around &euro;17 million). In 2004, Enterprise Ireland supported the establishment of 65 new export focused high potential companies involving a total investment of &euro;80m (around &euro;18 million approved by EI) and 61 new high growth <Col N="276"/>potential start-up businesses in 2003 involving a total investment of &euro;75 million (support in the region of &euro;14 million provided by Enterprise Ireland). In 2005, Shannon Development supported 38 start-ups in the mid-west region, 21 of which were HPSUs. This compares to 10 projects in 2004 with a job potential of 200 over 3-5 years and 11 in 2003 with a similar job potential.</P>
    <P>During 2005, 20 new start-ups were supported by IDA. In 2004 there were 24 such start-ups, in 2003 there were 27. Moreover, in 2005, IDA negotiated 71 new business projects with new and existing clients, involving a total investment over the coming years of more than &euro;760 million, with 46 of these locating outside Dublin. In 2004, 70 new business projects were negotiated with new and existing clients, which involve a total investment over the coming years of over &euro;5 billion. Some 64 projects were negotiated and secured by IDA during 2003. In the period in question Shannon Development supported 2 start-ups in the Shannon Free Zone and a number of FDI companies also expanded their operations.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the leading countries in Europe in terms of entrepreneurship, with levels of early stage entrepreneurial activity approaching those of the US. Research suggests that almost one in ten of the population living here is actively planning or has recently set up a new business. The recently published report of the Small Business Forum, Small Business is Big Business, examines the issues and challenges currently facing the small business sector and makes a number of key recommendations designed to enable the small business sector to achieve its full potential and enhance the significant contribution the sector already makes to the economic well-being of our country.</P>
    <P>In the context of the various pressures affecting global markets during the period, our overall economic performance is one of which we should be proud. Having said this, we must remain proactive in the context of maintaining and developing our competitive advantages. One of my Department&rsquo;s principal tasks is to ensure that Ireland continues to be an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, we have made significant efforts to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and to promote new areas of competitive advantage, such as developing our R&amp;D base.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As we have seen over the past 15 years, long term, sustainable economic growth and expansion in employment depends on a competitive and adaptable economy. The effects of <Col N="277"/>globalisation are being felt in even the smallest markets and global competition will both intensify and extend its reach well into the foreseeable future. For a long time this Government has recognised the inevitable changes taking place across world markets for both trade and investment. Enterprise policies that equip companies with the ability to better compete in world markets, capture the opportunities from globalisation and build competitive advantage in innovation and knowledge have been central to policy development and the impact is tangible.</P>
    <P>While some economic activity has moved to lower cost locations, for the most part this has been confined to lower value added activities where we no longer have a competitive advantage. Meanwhile employment creation and investment has developed in areas of product and service sophistication and we have won considerable new foreign investment in high technology sectors, research activities and from global companies selecting Ireland as a location for their European headquarters. For example, last year IDA Ireland supported some 50 research and development (R&amp;D) projects involving business investment of over &euro;275 million. This was a record both in number and value.</P>
    <P>At the same time Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to help transform its client base is making solid progress. Its support to Irish companies helped them increase exports last year by over 7% and to Asia in particular by almost 15%. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s mandate to prioritise R&amp;D supports helped 515 of its clients invest over &euro;100,000 each in meaningful R&amp;D in 2005, while 33 companies were involved in significant R&amp;D, i.e. involving an investment over &euro;2 million.</P>
    <P>This commitment of both resources and policy development is reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s employment performance. According to the CSO, employment increased by an annualised 89,800 to February 2006, or by 4.7%. This was the largest growth in employment Ireland has seen since 2000 and compares very favourably to the eurozone average of 1%.</P>
    <P>Maintaining the capacity of the economy to consistently generate new employment opportunities requiring higher skills and providing higher rewards is a key policy of this Government. Our policies have a strong competitiveness focus and we are succeeding. Recent research by the IMD World Competitiveness Scoreboard ranked us as the world&rsquo;s 11th most competitive economy, up one place on last year&rsquo;s position.</P>
    <P>Many challenges remain and while Ireland has traditionally underperformed in research and development, this Government is leading change with the announcement this week of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation. This Strategy is a key element of investment in the next National Development Plan and will oversee investment of &euro;3.8 billion by the public and private sector &mdash; investment that will help secure the future competitiveness of the economy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 164 together.</P>
    <P>I presume the questions relate to the recent abolition of the Groceries Order. The Groceries Order was abolished because it allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices being charged to consumers, virtually eliminated price competition in the grocery trade, resulted in more than 2,000 small independent retailers going out of business in a fifteen year period, and caused the grocery trade in Ireland to become more concentrated in the hands of fewer participants. The combined impact of these events was to create a floor price below which groceries could not be sold and this resulted in Irish consumers paying more for their groceries than would otherwise have been the case.</P>
    <P>The Groceries Order was in existence for a period of 18 years and it fundamentally altered the structure and composition of the grocery trade. It is simply unrealistic to expect this process and the damage caused by 18 years of the operation of the Order to be reversed in the space of 3 months. I do not think we should expect to see fundamental changes in market share, for example, in the short term.</P>
    <P>Recent inflation figures suggest that grocery prices have increased since the Order was removed. However, suggestions that such increases are as a result of greater competition following the removal of the Order, or that the removal the Order has failed in its objective, are a nonsense and do not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>There are many factors which impact on the price of groceries in our supermarkets. The lack of competition caused by the Groceries Order was only one such factor. Others would include production costs, labour costs, interest rates, overheads, international exchange rates and so on. Because of this, and despite the implication in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I never made any predictions as to the likely extent of price reductions resulting from the removal of the Order or as to the period of time over which such reductions might be expected to occur.</P>
    <P>If we are looking for explanations for rising grocery prices, do not blame the removal of the Groceries Order. On the contrary the removal of the Order will undoubtedly counter other <Col N="279"/>inflationary pressures. I think consumers are already seeing early benefits with one multiple recently announcing their intention over coming months to implement reductions in the prices of products previously covered by the Groceries Order. The real benefits however will be felt over time, as price competition re-emerges at retail level in the trade thus reversing the 18 years of damage done by the Order. The removal of the Groceries Order will stimulate competition, drive increased efficiencies at all levels of the distribution chain and eliminate the fixing of minimum retail prices by suppliers. This will create a downward pressure on grocery prices from which consumers will benefit.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Competition Authority to closely monitor this process &mdash; not least to ensure that the benefits of removing the Order are not thwarted by the emergence of other anti-competitive practices. That is why for example the Competition Act 2006 prohibits practices such as resale price maintenance, which were institutionalised by the Order. It would be very damaging to consumer interests if such practices were to emerge within the grocery trade in another guise. My officials have had some preliminary discussions with the Authority in this regard and will <Col N="280"/>meet them regularly as the process develops. I have also asked the Authority to report periodically on the results of their monitoring and to make any recommendations they consider appropriate in the light of their findings.</P>

	<P>The tabular statement gives redundancies notified to my Department from 2001 to date. These figures do not show the number of companies which have ceased trading; <Col N="280"/>companies can have redundancies without ceasing to trade. Figures relating to company closures are not available. Nor is it possible to determine the number of these jobs, if any, which have relocated to lower wage economies. Relocation is just one factor in the many enterprise-related issues that determine employment levels.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to work to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business. In that regard, we are making significant efforts to enhance our framework competitive conditions, and to promote new areas of competitive advantage, such as by developing our R&amp;D base as elaborated in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation. Our priority <Col N="281"/>remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy, and that are consequently less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences.</P>
    <P>To enhance competitiveness and increase productivity, the enterprise development agencies are working with companies to provide mentoring and developmental supports, develop management capabilities and critical workforce skills, support the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, to build productivity, and to provide support for innovation and for research and development. Furthermore, we are continuing to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, to help them find alternative employment.</P>

	<P>Our economy now has more than 1.9 million people in employment and continues to experience growth. This has led to skills shortages in some areas. However, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) has been charged with monitoring emerging Ireland&rsquo;s skills requirements. Since 1997, it has produced estimates of skills requirements by sector, including in ICT, Biotechnology, Finance, Engineering, and Construction. These estimates are regularly updated as the influencing factors change.</P>
    <P>The EGFSN provides my Department with a summary of current and future skills requirements in the form of a National Skills Bulletin. This identifies areas of growth where skills are in short supply; and also contains data on skills supply provided through the education and training system. It also provides advice to both my <Col N="282"/>Department and the Department of Education and Science on how numbers and skills needs may be met through education and training, as well as through managed migration.</P>
    <P>Additionally much has been done to ensure that the skills needs of the economy can, to the extent possible, be addressed through the upskilling of the existing workforce. Significantly, increased funding has been made available since 2005 for in-company training and for the development and expansion of the education system. My Department is currently preparing a National Skills Strategy which will review the likely skill needs of the economy to 2020.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Perry</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if he plans to replace the rent supplement with housing benefit in view of the Comptroller and Auditor General expressing concern regarding the rise in the cost of rent supplement; the amount expended in the scheme to date in County Sligo; if he has received representations from local authorities to increase the maximum rent offered as rents have risen significantly; if he will grant such increases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[24005/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to replace rent supplement with housing benefit. While expenditure on rent supplement is unavailable on a county by county breakdown I can confirm that expenditure this year on the rent supplement scheme up to the end May 2006 in the HSE North West Area covering counties Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim is &euro;5.63 million while expenditure nationally is &euro;161,172 million.</P>
    <P>Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. I have not received representations from local authorities seeking increases in these limits. Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels and in landlord income. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants in low income employment who may not qualify for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>My Department is in regular contact with the community welfare staff of the Health Service Executive regarding the various elements of the scheme. In the course of these ongoing contacts, the prescribed upper limits on rent levels supported under the rent supplement scheme have not emerged as having a detrimental impact on the ability of eligible tenants generally to secure suitable rented accommodation to meet their needs.</P><Col N="283"/>
    <P>My officials will again be reviewing the current levels of rent limits later this year in order in determine what limits should apply from December 2006 onwards. The review will take account of prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, based on indices from the Central Statistics Office, together with detailed input from the Health Service Executive on the market situation according to patterns of rent supplement applications within each of its operational areas.</P>
    <P>The review will also include consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In addition, it is expected a number of the voluntary agencies working in this area will also make detailed submissions. This process will ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</P>

	<P>In November 2005 EU and US negotiators concluded work on the text of a first-phase EU-US Open Skies agreement. The text was unanimously endorsed at the December 2005 Transport Council subject to sufficient progress by the US side on opening up ownership and control of US airlines to EU investors. The formal US process of changing its ownership and control rules was expected to be concluded early in 2006 so that a final decision could be taken at the June Transport Council. However, due to difficulties on the US side the rule-making process has been extended but they remain confident that the matter will be concluded in August in time for agreement at the October Transport Council.</P>

	<P>Penalty points are recorded on the relevant driving licence records contained in the National Driver File, which is held and administered by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The record is established under section 60 of the Finance Act, 1993, which provides that an officer of a Minister of the Government, a licensing authority or the competent authority for licensing vehicles and drivers of vehicles in another Member State of the European Communities, an officer of the Revenue Commissioners, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or such other persons as may be prescribed shall have access to and may inspect and examine these records. Article 11 of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999 allows licensing authorities to supply such information as is requested in relation to a driving licence or provisional licence to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    <P>In relation to access by motor insurer&rsquo;s to penalty point data the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in exercise of the powers conferred on him by sections 58(1) and 60(3) of the Finance Act 1993 has made regulations which provide for the release of data, inter alia, to &ldquo;Motor insurers approved by the Department of Transport for the purposes of supplying details of Driver Penalty Points imposed under the Road Traffic Act 2002 to facilitate insurance premium discounts to policy holders&rdquo;. Currently penalty point data is being made available to one motor insurer. A licence holder may make application to his or her licensing authority for a statement of the penalty points held on his or her licence record.</P>

    <P>Maintenance and cleaning of the Canal network is an operational matter for Waterways Ireland, who inform me that they carried out a major clean up of the area in and around the site of the large graving dock at Ringsend Basin on 30 May 2006. The site, known locally as Heiton&rsquo;s Yard, contained remnants of old boats and general rubbish and the material was loaded into skips and removed to an approved landfill site.</P>
    <P>In relation cleaning of the canals in general, I am informed that Waterways Ireland employs dedicated Operational Staff who are responsible for the upkeep of the canal network. These staff carry out day-to-day maintenance, operation and cleaning duties including weed control (cutting and spraying), dredging, grass cutting, hedge cutting, towpath/bank maintenance and litter collection. The litter removal and grass cutting work is generally undertaken on a continuous basis with each section being attended to on a rotating basis. In 2005, approximately &euro;7.57m was spent on maintaining the Canals. Approximately &euro;2.88m has been expended for this purpose to date in 2006.</P>

	<P>The Neighbourhood Watch scheme was established in 1985 by the Garda authorities as a crime prevention measure. In common with other community based schemes, it enlists the voluntary help of the community in co-operating with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is most <Col N="292"/>suitable for urban areas. There are approximately 2,600 Neighbourhood Watch schemes in operation nationwide with over 400,000 households involved. The Community Alert programme is a community based crime prevention initiative in rural communities which was set up by Muintir na T&iacute;re in association with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1985. It is a national movement with a network comprising over 1,290 local groups dedicated to improving the quality of life of people in rural communities.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the numbers of Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert schemes in County Sligo and North Leitrim in each of the past five years is set out in the table.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I requested a report from the Garda authorities in respect of the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>On 30 May, 2006 a call was made to the Garda Command and Control Communications Centre reporting the unauthorised taking of a van delivering to a business premises in Dublin 11. The vehicle was unattended with the keys in the ignition and the engine running at the time it was taken. The details were circulated by the Garda authorities to all Garda patrols at 11.21 am. A Garda Detective Unit was dispatched to this call at 11.22 am and was subsequently joined by a uniform Garda patrol car. Both units carried out a search of the area. The priority for the Garda&iacute; was to attempt to intercept the vehicle.</P>
    <P>At 12.26 pm a Garda unit went to the scene and a report was taken from the person in question. I am further informed that to date neither the vehicle nor its contents have been located and that the incident is being actively investigated by the Garda authorities. I understand that a Garda Inspector has updated the person in question on all aspects of the Garda investigation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 187 together.</P>
    <P>The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 sets out the obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences. A convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned <Col N="294"/>or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.</P>
    <P>Thereafter, the offender must notify the Garda&iacute; of any change of name or address within seven days of that change. Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Garda&iacute;.</P>
    <P>If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more s/he must inform the Garda&iacute; of this fact and the address at which s/he intends to stay and also notify the Garda&iacute; of his/her return. If s/he did not intend to stay away for more than seven days but did, s/he must inform the Garda&iacute; within a further seven days. The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries.</P>
    <P>It is an offence to fail to comply with the notification requirements. The penalty is imprisonment for up to 12 months or a fine of &euro;1,900 or both. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pursue all cases which come to their attention of persons who do not fulfil the reporting obligations placed on them by the Act.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that Kilfinane was one of 8 Garda stations in Counties Limerick and Tipperary which were selected by the Office of Public Works, following consultation with my Department and the Garda authorities, for inclusion in that Office&rsquo;s pilot Equity Exchange Programme which was publicised in 2004. However, the Office of Public Works considered that the level of interest expressed was not adequate to meet the requirements of that Programme. Further consideration has now been given by the Office of Public Works to an alternative approach and it is now proposed to build a new Basic Unit Type Garda Station at Kilfinane. In this regard, a brief of the accommodation requirements for the new station was agreed recently by all the relevant stakeholders and has just been received in my Department. The brief will now be forwarded to the Office of Public Works for appropriate action.</P>

It is not the normal practice of my Department to expedite cases save in certain exceptional emergency circumstances.

	<P>The person referred to is serving a life sentence for murder since December 1992. His case was reviewed by the Interim Parole Board in early 2002 and, following that review, the then Minister agreed to his transfer to the Training Unit. His temporary release programme was suspended in 2003 when he tested positive for cannabis on his return to the Training Unit. He was subsequently transferred to Wheatfield Prison, but returned to the Training Unit in January 2004.</P>
    <P>Following a review of his case in February 2005, he was encouraged to engage with the <Col N="296"/>therapeutic services available in the Training Unit in order to address specific concerns about his behaviour which had been highlighted in previous reviews. In light of his reported progress during this particular process I decided to approve his participation in a community based work and training programme, on a part-time basis. His participation and behaviour on this scheme will determine whether approval is granted in the future for an increase in the amount of time per week he is allowed to engage with this type of programme. Officials of the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform are currently putting in place the necessary arrangements for this process to commence. His case will, of course, continue to be kept under review.</P>

Local policing requirements are regularly reviewed by local management to ensure that they meet the policing needs of the area.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Assistant Commissioner of the Western Region has appointed a Garda Superintendent from outside the Garda Division in which the fatal collision referred to by the Deputy took place to carry out a full assessment of the investigation into the collision. The review will include an assessment of the investigation file forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. While it is not possible to state when the review will be completed, it is being carried out as expeditiously as possible and it is envisaged that it will be completed in the near future. The review of the investigation along with the recommendations of the appointed officer will then be considered by senior Garda management.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they are aware of the identity of a <Col N="298"/>number of Irish citizens who currently reside outside this jurisdiction and are believed to be involved in the sale and distribution of illicit drugs. In fact, many of these individuals choose to reside abroad for a variety of reasons, not least of which are the ongoing activities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in counteracting the sale and supply of illicit drugs within the State.</P>
    <P>Although the individuals concerned reside outside Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along with other law enforcement authorities, continues to target the activities of these individuals both within and outside this jurisdiction. This is achieved in a number of ways, including:</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Ongoing investigations and intelligence gathering by the Garda National Drugs Unit in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies both national and international, including the Customs Service;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Ongoing investigations and intelligence gathering by other national units, including the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation; and</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Ongoing investigations and activities by divisional and district drug units operating throughout the State.</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">All of these activities identify key organisations involved in drug trafficking and distribution. Having identified the key players, the relevant units undertake targeted operations designed to reduce the supply of drugs within society and gather sufficient evidence to sustain successful prosecutions against the principals involved.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate co-operation between law enforcement agencies in the investigation of criminal activity, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a number of liaison officers posted in EU Member States. In addition, Ireland is a member of Europol and has access through liaison officers, based at The Hague, to police forces throughout the European Union. Ireland also has direct access to all Interpol National Bureaux, which enhances and facilitates police co-operation even further.</P>
    <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works with law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions in a number of ways. These include:</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The exchange of strategic intelligence on the activities and <i>modus operandi</i> of criminal networks involved in the international trafficking of controlled drugs;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The exchange of operational intelligence on the activities of criminal organisations involved in drug distribution;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>The conducting of investigations within the State at the request of foreign law enforcement agencies, in accordance with legis<Col N="299"/>lation governing mutual assistance in criminal matters;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>and Requesting the assistance of other jurisdictions in conducting investigations on behalf of the Irish State, in accordance with arrangements for mutual assistance in criminal matters.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">The Garda National Drugs Unit has primary responsibility for the investigation of illicit drug trafficking. Their strategies for dealing with drug offences are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs.</P>
    <P>In 2005, the Garda National Drugs Unit conducted separate investigations into the activities of Irish criminals operating in Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands. These investigations led to the arrest of a number of major criminals both here and abroad and the seizure of substantial quantities of illegal drugs. In fact, the recent &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme pointed to the success of joint investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and law enforcement authorities in other EU Member States.</P>
    <P>Also, in November last year, the strength of the Organised Crime Unit in the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation was augmented by 55 officers, who are specifically tasked with targeting organised crime groups through various targeted operations. Criminal gangs are targeted through intelligence led operations using all the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including surveillance, monitoring, searches and general disruption of criminal activities through patrolling and check points.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Operation Delivery&rdquo; has targeted organised gangs involved in armed robberies and has resulted in a reduction of this type of crime this year. This, in turn, impacts on money available to criminals to purchase drugs, firearms and other resources.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the assets accumulated by organised crime gangs have been targeted by the Criminal Assets Bureau. A substantial number of properties believed to be the proceeds of crime have been identified and inquiries are ongoing in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that operations at an international, national and local level to counteract the activities of both existing and emerging criminal networks will be continued and that every possible law enforcement measure will be utilised against them.</P>
    <P>Finally, but not least, I will continue to keep the measures and resources for tackling organised crime, including drug trafficking, under review. I will also continue to work with my EU colleagues in the Justice and Home Affairs Council to ensure that every possible measure, legislative or <Col N="300"/>otherwise, is put in place to enhance EU strategies for combating transnational organised crime.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together.</P>
    <P>The Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956-86 prohibit gambling except in certain specifically defined circumstances. Casino-style operations are not covered within these exceptions. Such operations are therefore unlawful. I have no proposals that would alter the present policy of the Acts, but rather to tighten the enforceability of that policy by way of better provision on the evidence to be obtained in relation to unlawful gambling and on the procedure involved in closing down a casino. The provisions by which it is intended to achieve this are being developed in my Department in consultation with the Attorney General, among others. The details will be announced as amendments for inclusion in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill at Committee Stage.</P>

    <P FLI="0">It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
    <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and the second such group did so on the 8th of June. Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the areas referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

However, the person referred to was found to be in contempt of court by the District Judge and was sentenced to seven days imprisonment in Mountjoy Prison. A committal warrant was issued and the person referred to was lodged in custody at the Bridewell Prison section and subsequently taken to Mountjoy Prison on 31 May, 2006. On 1 June, 2006 the person referred to was granted leave to seek a judicial review and was granted High Court bail.</P>

	<P>At the outset I should say that the tragic deaths to which the Deputy refers are unrelated save for the fact that both occurred following detention in Garda custody. The circumstances of the first case are quite different from those of the second case. In the first case, unlike the second case, all are agreed that the young man in question suffered serious injuries in a Garda Station.</P>
    <P>In so far as the question of independent inquiries is concerned I have nothing to add to the positions as set out in my responses to Parliamentary Question No. 77 of 8 June 2006 and No. 409 of 6 July 2004 respectively. With regard to the second aspect of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the information currently available to me is at variance with what the Deputy characterises as harassment. However, I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that an incident concerning the first family is the subject of an investigation by a Detective Superintendent from a Division outside the relevant area.</P>

	<P>Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil teacher ratio in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for education inclusion that I launched in May, 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in the 180 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>
    <P>Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next 2 years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on <Col N="305"/>the 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.</P>
    <P>The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Circular 0023/2006 outlining the revised staffing schedule for the 2006/2007 school year is available on the Department of Education &amp; Science website. Hard copies of the circular have been issued to all primary schools.</P>
    <P>Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The mainstream staffing of the schools referred to by the Deputy for the 2006/2007 school year will be a Principal and 19 mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 521 pupils on 30th September 2005, in the junior school and Principal and 14 mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 395 pupils on 30th September 2005, in the senior school.</P>
    <P>It is open to the Board of Management of a primary school to submit an appeal, under certain criteria, to the Primary Staffing Appeal Board. The Board adjudicates on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools and operates independently of the Minister and my Department. The Board&rsquo;s decisions are final. The criteria under which an appeal can be made have been revised and are set out in Primary Circular 0024/2006, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The closing date for the receipt of staffing appeals are 24th June 2006 and 18th October 2006.</P>
    <P>Schools catering for newcomer pupils who have significant English language deficits are entitled to assistance to enable these pupils gain full access to the curriculum. Schools that have 14 to 27 non-English speaking pupils enrolled are entitled to a full-time temporary language support teaching post at primary level. Schools with <Col N="306"/>28 or more such pupils are entitled to two full-time temporary language support teachers. In exceptional cases, following consideration by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, a third teaching post may be sanctioned. The support for an individual pupil is provided for a period of up to two years.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that both the junior and senior schools in question will have three temporary language support teacher posts for the 2006/07 school year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 233 together.</P>
    <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the new School Support Programme under DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by qual<Col N="307"/>ity assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. The ERC&rsquo;s overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act (1998), section 32(9), as: &ldquo;...the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey of all primary schools in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved. The analysis of the survey returns by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the School Support Programme. The variables involved are:</P>

<P LI="1">% unemployment</P>
<P LI="1">% local authority accommodation</P>
<P LI="1">% lone parenthood</P>
<P LI="1">% Travellers</P>
<P LI="1">% large families (5 or more children)</P>
<P LI="1">% pupils eligible for free books</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the School Support Programme were as follows: Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates) Junior Certificate retention rates by school Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS &ldquo;Overall Performance Scale&rdquo; score). This was based on each student&rsquo;s performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best Leaving Certificate retention rates by school.</P>
    <P>While the whole rationale behind the new programme is to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from all of the available supports, schools that are benefiting from pre-existing schemes will keep the extra resources, financial and human, that they are getting under these initiatives for the 2006/07 school year. After that they will continue to get support in line with the level of socio-economic disadvantage among their pupils. The school to which the Deputies refer is not in any of the pre-existing schemes to address educational disadvantage.</P>

When these schedules are completed my Department will be in further contact with the school authorities as to the next steps involved in progressing this project.</P>

	<P>The three Third Level Student Support Schemes, administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department, offer financial assistance to eligible students attending approved third level courses. Students entering approved courses for the first time are, generally speaking, eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Under the Free Fees Initiative, my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses in the State, which must be of at least two years duration, at an approved college. Where a candidate is pursuing an approved course at Postgraduate level in an institution listed as an approved institution for the purpose of my Department's Higher Education Grant Scheme and VEC Scholarship Scheme the Awarding Body may award a full or part grant in respect of the candidate&rsquo;s lecture fee subject to the terms of the Scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department has examined the details of the course to which the person the Deputy refers is attending on the basis as to whether or not an application could be made for assistance under the 2005 Higher Education Grant Scheme. My Department is aware that the first semester of the LLM Human Rights Cross Border course is completed in Queen&rsquo;s University, the second in NUI <Col N="310"/>Galway and the third can be spent in either Queen&rsquo;s University or NUIG. The person the deputy refers to has chosen to remain in NUIG for the third semester. However, my Department understands that all fees are paid to Queen&rsquo;s University who in turn make a payment to NUIG in respect of the period of study there.</P>
    <P>The residency requirement, under the prescribed provisions of the 2005 Higher Education Grant Scheme, requires in the case of an independent mature candidate the candidate to have been ordinarily resident in the administrative area of the Local Authority from the 1st October 2004. The person to whom the Deputy refers has confirmed to my Department and to Galway County Council that she resided in Scotland for the past number of years. Candidates who are E.U. nationals and who do not satisfy the residency requirement are eligible to apply for a means tested fees only grant in respect of an approved course.</P>
    <P>The particular clause which applies in this case is Clause 4.1.2 of the 2005 Higher Education Grant Scheme which states as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P LI="1">&ldquo;Candidates who are E.U. nationals and who do not satisfy the residency requirement are eligible to apply for a means-tested fees only grant in respect of approved courses in the Republic of Ireland, provided they have been ordinarily resident, for a purpose other than wholly or mainly to receive full-time education, in an E.U. Member State from 1 October, 2004. Such candidates shall apply to the Local Authority in which the college they propose to attend is situated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0" Just="Left">There are two points in this clause that impacts on this candidate&rsquo;s eligibility under the prescribed provisions of my Department's 2005 Higher Education Grant Scheme. The first is &ldquo;in respect of approved courses in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;. As the course is run by Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast it does not meet the criteria of an approved course in the Republic of Ireland. Secondly, the last line of the clause &ldquo;candidates shall apply to the Local Authority in which the college they propose to attend is situated&rdquo;. As Queen&rsquo;s University is located in Belfast it is not located in a Local Authority administrative area and, consequently, a grant application cannot be submitted to a local authority in the area in which the university is situated.</P>
    <P>My Department understands that students attending the LLM Human Rights Cross Border course must pay their full fees to Queen&rsquo;s University, a facility does not exist for a student to divide and pay the institutions separately. All applications for the course must be submitted to Queen&rsquo;s University and not through NUIG.</P>
    <P>An application for a means tested fees only grant in respect of the part of the course pursued <Col N="311"/>in NUIG cannot be considered independently for assistance.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P><Col N="312"/>
    <P>As you know all schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>So, as I have pointed out the general rule in the current school year is that at least one classroom teacher is provided for every 29 pupils. Furthermore, the actual average class size nationally is 24.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes. Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year.</P>
    <P>Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, I often find that when I look into why a particular school has a class of 35 in a particular grade, the answer is because there is another class in the same school with a much lower than average number of pupils in it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</P>
    <P>This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I want to state that no school has been told that they are going to lose any of the resources that they have been receiving under pre-existing schemes for tackling disadvantage as a result of the introduction of the new DEIS initiative. On the contrary, the new School <Col N="315"/>Support Programme is aimed at providing even more extra resources for the most disadvantaged schools in the country.</P>
    <P>Schools that did not qualify for the new programme will keep the extra resources they are getting under pre-existing schemes for the 2006/07 school year and after that they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
    <P>The new DEIS programme will be of huge benefit to schools in Leitrim and Sligo. One urban/town primary school and 9 rural primary schools in County Leitrim will benefit from the supports available from the new programme. In County Sligo, 3 urban/town primary schools, 11 rural primary schools and 4 second-level schools will benefit.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is important to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities get all the extra support possible and will welcome the extra resources that DEIS will provide for schools in Leitrim and Sligo. I can assure the Deputy that there is no reason for schools that have not been identified for the new programme to worry as they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
    <P>A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. This review process is under way and it is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of the current school year.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of full-time caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. These caretakers are paid directly on my Department&rsquo;s payroll.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that my Department has introduced a superannuation scheme for caretakers employed under the 1979 scheme. Deductions have commenced from salaries of eligible personnel with effect from 7 March 2006. The scheme has been introduced with retrospective effect to 1 September 2001 and eligible caretakers will be notified in due course of the arrears of contributions due in respect of the period since 1 September 2001. In accordance with standard public service arrangements, there is provision for reckoning previous service given, subject to payment of appropriate contributions.</P>
    <P>Eligible personnel and school authorities were informed of the introduction of the superannuation scheme prior to the commencement of <Col N="317"/>deductions from salaries. A formal circular, setting out further details regarding the superannuation scheme, will issue from the Pensions Unit in my Department as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The 1979 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the Ancillary Services grant. The Ancillary Services grant provides additional per capita funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives Boards of Management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The caretakers employed under the Ancillary Services Grant are paid by the managerial authorities of the schools. These personnel can avail of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) to provide for their retirement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has been strongly supportive of the peace process in Sudan, generally, and also in the troubled region of Darfur, providing financial support to the UN-authorised African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) there, as well as seconding an army officer, as a military observer, to it between July 2004 and June 2005. Since July 2005, Ireland has provided one officer &mdash; a Logistics Planner &mdash; as part of the EU support staff to the mission. In addition, Ireland also provides one officer, who acts as Deputy Military Adviser to the EU Special Representative to the Sudan and one non-commissioned officer. All 3 personnel are currently based in Addis Ababa.</P>
    <P>On 16 May, 2006, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1679, which paves the way for a UN force in Darfur and for the transition of the present UN-authorised African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to UN command. The UN has been engaged for some time in planning and identifying the military capabilities that may be required, and has commenced consultations with member states, including Ireland, to accelerate the sourcing of these capabilities. An informal request for Irish Defence Forces participation was received from the UN last month. However, after careful consideration of the request, the UN was advised that, due to the extension of our engagement in Liberia to May 2007, together with our other substantial commitments to UN Peace <Col N="320"/>support operations, we are not at this time in a position where we could provide personnel to the prospective UN Mission in Sudan.</P>
    <P>Among the factors to be taken into account by Ireland when considering any particular request to participate in a mission, is the degree of risk involved. A detailed reconnaissance, including a security assessment of the mission area, is conducted by a Defence Forces team prior to the deployment of personnel to any new mission. The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern to me. While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions, it is my policy and practice to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. All possible precautions are taken to ensure the safety of our troops. I can assure the Deputy that, in the event of any deployment of the Defence Forces to Sudan as part of a UN mission in the future, a full risk assessment will be conducted in accordance with standing procedures and all appropriate measures to protect and ensure the safety of our troops will be taken.</P>

	<P>MONUC is the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and was established in February 2000 by Resolution 1291 of the United Nations Security Council. It is headquartered in Kinshasa and consists of about 16,000 troops. Ireland contributes three military observers to the mission.</P>
    <P>Elections are due to take place in DRC under UN supervision in July 2006. In December 2005, the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) invited the EU to consider the possibility of providing &ldquo;a suitably earmarked force reserve that could enhance MONUC&rsquo;s quick reaction capabilities during and immediately after the electoral process.&rdquo; The EU responded positively to the UN request and EUFOR RD Congo will be deployed to support MONUC during the electoral process. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1671 of 25 April, 2006 authorised the EU to deploy a European Union Force, codenamed &ldquo;EUFOR RD Congo&rdquo;, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in support of MONUC, during the electoral period in the DRC, for a period ending four months after the date of the first round of the presidential and parliamentary elections there. The DRC authorities have welcomed the EU military support to MONUC during the electoral process. On 25 <Col N="321"/>April, 2006, the Council of the EU adopted a &ldquo;Joint Action&rdquo; to launch the EU mission in support of MONUC. The Council appointed Lieutenant General Karlheinz Viereck (Germany) EU Operation Commander and Major General Christian Damay (France) EU Force Commander.</P>
    <P>Ireland from the outset has been positively disposed towards the proposed mission and on 9 May 2006 the Government authorised the Minister for Defence to despatch up to ten (10) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with EUFOR RD Congo. Ireland offered up to 10 Staff Officers for the Headquarters of the Force. However, the mission is oversubscribed, so only 7 of the 10 will be deployed, 5 in Potsdam in the Operational Headquarters and 2 in Kinshasa in the Force Headquarters. Five Defence Forces personnel assigned to the Operational Headquarters for the mission in Potsdam (Germany) have now deployed. The two remaining personnel assigned to the Force Headquarters in Kinshasa will deploy shortly. Under the responsibility of the Council of the EU, the Political and Security Committee will exercise the political control and strategic direction of EUFOR RD Congo.</P>

	<P>Ireland has participated in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan since 5 July, 2002, following Government Decision S140/45/28/0002 of 2 July, 2002 authorising the provision of seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force. The level of threat to Defence Forces personnel on all Peace Support Operations is kept under constant review and the necessary force protection measures are put in place as required.</P>
    <P>The overall threat to ISAF assets in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the seven members of the Defence Forces are operating, is currently assessed as &ldquo;significant&rdquo;. Ongoing risk assessments will continue to take account of the situation on the ground. In view of the increased risks in ISAF and following a review of the threat to our personnel in Kabul, additional security and protective measures have been put in place. Armoured protection vehicles have now been provided to the personnel serving in Kabul and other security measures in relation to routes and travel have also been taken.</P>
    <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern to me. While no <Col N="322"/>absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions, it is my policy and practice to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. All possible precautions are taken to ensure the safety of our troops. None of the troops is exposed to any unnecessary risks and all possible precautions are taken to ensure their safety. In addition, Standard Operating Procedures are kept under review in light of experience and best practice.</P>
    <P>Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection. Pre-deployment training is provided to members of the Permanent Defence Force and is updated in the light of any increased threat. I am satisfied that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to say that I have recently received from the military authorities their report on the minimum height standards for Defence Forces personnel. This report was prepared in the context of encouraging more women to apply to join the Defence Forces. The report deals comprehensively with the complex issues relating to this matter and as such requires careful consideration. I will be reviewing the height requirement for entry to both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, in the light of this report, and would expect to be able to make a decision on this matter shortly. It is also my intention to publish the report in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would point out that height is not the only issue in encouraging more women to apply to join the Defence Forces. Accordingly, I have recently initiated more general research in this area. To this end, tenders have been received from companies willing to undertake research into the issues of the recruitment and retention of women in the Defence Forces. It is intended that the research will test women&rsquo;s attitudes to military life and careers in the Defence Forces. I envisage that the research will include interviews with serving female members of both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, and also with members of the general public. The contract for the research will be awarded in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces, in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. <Col N="324"/>In effect this means that women are eligible on the same basis as men for participation in operational and ceremonial activities, for assignment to all military appointments and educational and training courses and for promotion. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts. All applicants for service in the Defence Forces, both male and female, are interviewed on an equal basis and then placed in order of merit. It is not possible to give one gender priority over another as this would result in an equality issue.</P>
    <P>All competition selection boards and general service interview boards are briefed on equality issues and specifically in relation to gender and diversity issues. All new entrants into the Defence Forces receive training during induction on equality and interpersonal relationships and on redress systems. All career courses and leadership seminars contain modules on equality and interpersonal relationships. All instructors are briefed on bullying and discrimination, and there is an instruction guiding instructors and students alike. The Defence Forces have no restrictions or barriers to females serving in any appointment or in any rank. Selection and promotion is based on merit.</P>
    <P>Female strength levels in the Permanent Defence Force have increased from 4.4% of overall strength in 2001 to 5% of overall strength in 2005. The Defence Forces have, in the last five years, doubled the percentage intake of female Cadets to an average of 20%. In 2005, 10.4% of enlistments for General Service were by females. This is measurable progress in increasing gender balance in the Defence Forces. Females make up approximately 25% of the Reserve Defence Force personnel. Some 30% of last years Reserve Defence Force recruit intake were female. The percentage of females enlisted for General Service is, in general, in proportion to the number of enlistment applications received from females.</P>
    <P>The table shows the percentage of female applications in comparison to male applications to the Permanent Defence Force in 2005.</P><Col N="323"/>

    <P FLI="0">Elements of the Doctoral thesis of a former member of the Defence Forces received certain publicity in the media approximately five years ago. The elements of the thesis, which received widest publicity, related to alleged incidences of bullying and harassment experienced by members of the Defence Forces. In September 1991, my <Col N="324"/>predecessor established an Independent External Advisory Committee chaired by Dr Eileen Doyle to examine the nature and extent of any inappropriate interpersonal behaviours such as harassment, bullying, sexual harassment or discrimination within the Defence Forces and to make recommendations.</P><Col N="325"/>
    <P>Their report in 2002 &ldquo;Challenge of a Workplace&rdquo; was followed up by the report of the subsequent Independent Monitoring Group (IMG). The IMG were charged with giving effect to the recommendations of the 2002 report. The report of the IMG was published in 2004. This latter report &ldquo;Response to the Challenge of a Workplace&rdquo; details the extensive range of measures taken to implement the recommendations of the initial 2002 report. The IMG report acknowledged that significant advances had been made. Since then, the majority of recommendations in both reports have been implemented with the remainder under active consideration. I am satisfied that the Defence Forces comply with best practice in the human resources area and that the Defence Forces are leaders in this area.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the claim in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, in accordance with the Independent Monitoring Group Report, the Defence Forces appointed an Equality Officer in June 2004; this position has been filled continuously since that date. The Defence Forces have published their Equality and Equal Status Policy, which commits the Defence Forces to embedding equality in all aspects of the Defence Forces working environment. The Defence Forces provide a wide range of support measures such as the Chaplaincy Service, the Personnel Support Services, an independent Confidential Helpline Service, a &lsquo;Designated Contact Person&rsquo; Scheme, Representative Associations, Welfare Committees and Medical Services to support a positive progressive working environment.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces comply fully with all provisions of the Employment Equality Acts applicable to them. Because of the particular requirements and nature of military life, the Defence Forces are exempt from the age and disability grounds of the Employment Equality Acts. Within the Defence Forces, both men and women have &lsquo;equality of opportunity&rsquo; for employment and career advancement on the basis of merit and personal ability. Discrimination is prohibited. It is Defence Forces policy that all members have a right to be treated with respect and dignity and to carry out their duties free from any form of sexual harassment, harassment or bullying. This commitment requires all Defence Forces personnel to treat colleagues with respect and ensure that their own actions and behaviour do not cause offence.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
     <Quest>the reasons for ethnic minorities being under-represented within the Defence Forces; and if he will institute changes to the Defence Forces recruiting policy that might allow for the increased recruitment of ethnic minorities and women.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of the recruitment of ethnic minorities is not a new one, Defence Force Regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of ethnic minorities to the Defence Forces. Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, Apprenticeship Competition, General Service Enlistment or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments. All applicants for each of these entry streams are required to meet qualifying criteria.</P>
    <P>I have recently made changes to the Cadet competition to broaden the entry criteria thereby making it easier for qualifying foreign nationals/ethnic minorities to apply for cadetships. In addition, the Defence Forces Equality Policy which was recently produced and formalised underpins equality legislation and states that the Defence Forces:</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Are committed to the principles of equal opportunities in all its employment policies, procedures and regulations;</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Will operate in an environment without discrimination in areas as provided by the Equality Acts;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Will ensure that the principles of employment equality are employed in recruitment, promotion, training and work experience;</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>All regulations and Administrative Instructions concerning service in the Defence Forces shall be set out in a manner consistent with this policy of equal opportunity; and</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p8- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>This policy will be reviewed along with the Defence Force regulations on an ongoing basis by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) to ensure compliance with best practice and to maintain a working environment that treats all members of the Defence Forces in a manner consistent with equal opportunities.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">The primary focus in recruitment is to attract people with the core competencies required by the Defence Forces. In relation to the recruitment of women into the Defence Forces I am pleased to say that I have recently received a report from the military authorities on the height requirement. I will be reviewing the height requirement for entry to both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, in the light of this report, and would expect to be able to make a decision on this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>However as I have mentioned previously I believe that the height requirement is only one element of the overall matter of how more women might be encouraged to enlist in the <Col N="327"/>Defence Forces. In this context I believe it is important that we look at the whole range of possibly contributing factors. To that end I intend shortly to award a contract for research into women&rsquo;s attitudes to military life and a career in the Defence Forces, which will inform our recruitment policy in the future.</P>
    <P>The operational requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces are not directly comparable. My Department is not specifically targeting the recruitment of ethnic minorities for the Defence Forces at present. Currently my emphasis is on ensuring that there are no barriers to ethnic minorities or foreign nationals joining the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P>To date, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) has carried out 1222 measurements for radon in homes in County Sligo. Of these, 302 had radon concentration levels in excess of the national reference level of 200 Becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m3). Of the 209 homes measured by the RPII for radon in County Leitrim, 13 had concentration levels in excess of the national reference level. I should mention that the RPII is not the only organisation carrying out a radon measurement service. There are companies in the private sector which also provide this service.</P>
    <P>The Government, largely through the RPII, has for many years committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations. Householders, particularly those in high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary. Government efforts and resources, together with those of the RPII, continue to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the Capital Assistance Scheme relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The administration of the scheme, and the certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the scheme, are the responsibility of the local authority, in this instance Galway County Council. An application for funding of this project has not been received from the Council.</P>

	<P>Capital funding is available <Col N="331"/>through my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme to approved voluntary housing bodies to provide accommodation to meet special housing needs, such as elderly, homeless or persons with disabilities. The scheme is not intended for the provision of nursing home or similar accommodation where residents would require exten<Col N="332"/>sive medical, nursing or institutional type care. My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the scheme relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The administration of the scheme, and the certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the scheme, are the responsibility of the appropriate local authority.</P>
