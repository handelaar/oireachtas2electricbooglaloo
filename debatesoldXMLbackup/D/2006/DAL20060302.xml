    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance and concern, namely, the urgent need to assist the families of the Stardust fire tragedy in Artane on St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day, 1981; the need to hold a fresh inquiry into this terrible fire; and the need for all Members of the Oireachtas to support the march in Drumcondra next Saturday and to give the families the maximum advice and support on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of major national importance, namely, the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to reconsider her stance on the provision of free health care to an estimated 100 women who are desperately ill with hepatitis C but who have not tested positive. They have every other manifestation of hepatitis C, they received a positive diagnosis of the disease from their consultant hepatologist and desperately need help. I urge the T&aacute;naiste to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the use of Shannon Airport by the Commander in Chief of the US armed forces to meet and rally US soldiers involved under his orders in the criminal occupation of Iraq, with cataclysmic consequences for the Iraqi people; whether the Irish Government had prior knowledge of and authorised this event and whether it will tax the public purse to pay for the security provided for it; and to require the Taoiseach to address the D&aacute;il on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate a matter of urgent national importance, namely, the increasing levels of obesity and heart disease in Ireland and the related need to improve urgently active participation levels in sport by children and adults through tens of millions of additional investment in facilities. This would save the State money in the medium term, as the Minister for Health and Children will be interested to know, because it would result in lower health care costs and increased productivity. I request this debate particularly in light of the reply of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to my parliamentary question of yesterday, in which he stated that 37%, or more than one third, of all sports funding is spent on horses and dogs. I gather the only exercise most people get is walking to the pub or the bookies. This is a scandal and I am gobsmacked.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to consider a matter of national importance requiring urgent attention, namely, the study showing a significant level of tuberculosis infection in parts of Dublin city; the inadequate hospital treatment provision for tuberculosis patients following the failure to put in place promised inpatient beds and medical teams in the wake of the grossly irresponsible closure of the tuberculosis unit at Peamount Hospital, which closure the Government facilitated; and the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to outline the measures she will introduce to address this threat to public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of vital national interest, namely, the recent and alarming reports of increased incidence of tuberculosis, with particular reference to the north inner city; the obvious failure to provide the promised 18-bed unit in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin, on the closure of the specialised unit at Peamount Hospital, which had previously catered expertly for such patients; the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to clarify why the very effective specialised unit at Peamount Hospital was closed; why, despite promises made at the time, no replacement facilities have been provided and why co-ordinated maintenance and treatment have been discontinued; and if the Minister will now indicate her intention to directly intervene with a view to resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent public importance, namely, the increasing levels of tuberculosis in Irish society and the <Col N="1887"/>need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to ensure that full tuberculosis services be restored at Peamount Hospital; and the need to implement the recommendations of experts such as Dr. Luke Clancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 12, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the law applicable to contractual obligations &mdash; Rome 1 &mdash; back from committee; No. 13, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a Council regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and co-operation in matters relating to maintenance obligations &mdash; back from committee; No. 14, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a Council decision annexed to the communication from the Commission to the Council calling on the Council to provide for measures relating to maintenance obligations taken under Article 65 of the treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that treaty &mdash; back from committee; No. 22, Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Report Stage resumed and Final Stage; No. 24, Building Control Bill 2005 &mdash; Second Stage, resumed; and No. 25 &mdash; statements on Transport 21.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 12, 13 and 14 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on Report and Final Stages of No. 22 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the following arrangements shall apply regarding No. 25: the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, Labour Party and Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statements of each other member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 12, 13 and 14 without debate agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 22, the conclusion of Report and <Col N="1888"/>Final Stages of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005, agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed. I am conscious that the Report and Final Stages of the Bill could conclude before 1.30 p.m. but one must object in principle to the application of a guillotine. The Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005 is important because it will have a significant effect on the retail sector. I urge the Government to remove the guillotine from the proposal and allow the debate on the various amendments which have been presented to proceed without restriction. The imposition of a guillotine is unnecessary. In a previous manifestation, the Government Chief Whip introduced very few guillotines. That marked his early stage in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I ask the T&aacute;naiste about four Bills in her area of responsibility? Some 58 Bills were published in 2004 and 41 Bills were published in 2005. The number seems to be drying up now.</P>
      <P>I commend the T&aacute;naiste on meeting the representatives of the women to whom the Neary case relates. I am glad that the Government has announced it will establish a redress board to deal with the hurt and emotional scars of the women in question. It is commendable because it is the right thing to do.</P>
      <P>Three times last year, the House was promised legislation to establish a nursing home inspectorate, but there is no sign of it. More than a year after the Supreme Court judgment on the charges imposed on people in long-stay institutions, there is no sign of legislation to provide for repayments to them. The T&aacute;naiste is aware that many such people are reaching the end of their lives, but there is no sign of legislation to compensate them. The House has not been given an indication of when legislation to provide for the statutory establishment of the health information and quality authority will be brought before the House. There is no sign of the pharmacy legislation. I have referred to four important Bills.</P>
      <P>In commending the T&aacute;naiste on meeting the women involved in the Neary case, I ask her to agree to the request for a similar meeting that was made by Parents for Justice, which represents the parents of deceased children whose organs were removed for research purposes without their knowledge or consent, in its letter of 8 February last. The group would like confirmation that 54 boxes of material which were presented to the T&aacute;naiste by Ms Anne Dunne SC, who conducted an inquiry into this matter, will not be destroyed as their contents have never been published. Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the material will not be destroyed and that she will meet representatives of Parents for Justice to discuss their problems? We should have a debate on the report at an appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism is delighted to accept Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s congratulations on behalf of the Irish football team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The last politician to try to claim such credit for a sporting victory was Charlie Haughey in Paris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check with my office whether my willingness to meet representatives of Parents for Justice to discuss the Madden <Col N="1890"/>report on organ retention has been communicated to them. I have indicated that I am more than happy to meet the group on foot of its request for a meeting. I will have to get legal advice on whether the documentation that was submitted by Ms Anne Dunne SC can be made available. I am certain that there is no intention to destroy it. It was passed on to Dr. Deirdre Madden when she was compiling her report. When the documentation was originally submitted to me, the legal advice I was given was that it was not possible to publish it.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a nursing home inspectorate will be provided for in the legislation that will establish the health information and quality authority on a statutory basis. That legislation will be presented to the Cabinet next Tuesday, as will the legislation relating to long-stay charges. The pharmacy and medical practitioners legislation, which is being worked on as a matter of priority in the Department of Health and Children and the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, will be ready later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask some questions on the findings of the report on the practices at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s decisions to meet representatives of the women who suffered at the hands of Dr. Neary and to establish a compensation scheme. I am sure she recognises that the Government does not have a good record on compensation schemes. Almost 18 months have passed since we were told that elderly people who were illegally charged for long-term care would get their money back, but we are still waiting for the relevant legislation. When will the legislation that is needed to establish a compensation scheme for the women involved in the Neary case be brought to the Cabinet? How does the T&aacute;naiste intend to decide who will be responsible for the payment of such compensation? That the Government&rsquo;s record in this regard is not good is clear when one considers its handling of the redress scheme for people who were mistreated in residential institutions. Will the women who suffered at the hands of Dr. Neary have to wait for agreement to be reached between the Department and the hospital authorities, or will they be compensated in advance of such an agreement? That question needs to be answered.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the T&aacute;naiste about the serious implications of an issue that was mentioned in the report on the Neary case. The report raised doubts about current practice in other hospitals in peripheral areas. Does the Government intend to carry out a full assessment of services in public and private hospitals throughout the country? Such an assessment is necessary if we are to ensure that women can access proper care and are not subject to practices which are damaging their health. A few months have passed <Col N="1891"/>since the religious ethos interfered with the care of a cancer patient in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, which is hardly a peripheral hospital. What are the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s plans for conducting a full assessment throughout the country to ensure that best practice prevails? I suggest that the report on the Neary case be referred, after it is debated in the House next Wednesday, to the Joint Committee on Health and Children to ensure that its extensive findings are the subject of ongoing scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said to Deputy Kenny, a Bill providing for repayments to those who had to pay long-stay charges will be presented to the Cabinet next week. It is intended that the legislation will be brought through the Oireachtas over the next few months and it is hoped that it will be passed by the summer. The legislation has proven to be quite complex as a result of issues relating to wards of court, etc. It is ready to be considered by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday that the Government is committed in principle to ensuring that women who were affected by the actions of Dr. Neary will be compensated. Although the Government has not formalised that position, we will discuss it shortly. I was anxious to meet Patient Focus, the group representing the affected women, to hear its reaction to the report and to get its input into any redress proposal the Government might put in place. The intention is to ensure we bring closure as quickly as possible for the affected women. They have been waiting eight years. They have confidence in the judge and her report and they made that clear to me yesterday. They are anxious that the Government brings early closure to this.</P>
      <P>There are issues surrounding insurance. Everyone in the House supports the notion that the taxpayer would be liable to a minimal extent, which may result in issues for insurers. However, we would not want the women affected to experience a delay in their compensation while the Government pursues the issue with insurers. The matter may require legislation and is being examined by the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I met four representatives of the medical board of the hospital and the hospital&rsquo;s management team. I am satisfied that there is a determination to put into effect the recommendations of this report, especially those concerned with audit and information. Mr. John O&rsquo;Brien and his team from the national hospitals office will visit the hospital to discuss a precise timeframe with the management and the clinicians. The college of obstetrics has an inspectorate and a training function in this regard. Representatives from the college visited Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in 1987 and 1992. They made recommendations following their visit in 1992 which were not implemented. I want to discuss with them how we can ensure that recom<Col N="1892"/>mendations made will have an impact on patient safety. I also want to have discussions with the Medical Council.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>Patients&rsquo; safety should come before the ethos of any institution. Patient care and safety must be paramount. Professor Drumm and the HSE are very determined to ensure that appropriate standards of safety are in place across the hospital system. Given the recommendations of this report, it is particularly important that we look at what the judge called &ldquo;isolated units&rdquo; that may be operating in the health system and not just in obstetrics. I believe that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is now the safest place in the country. The hospital has seven obstetricians and two or three of them will discuss each individual case. The same applies with the anaesthetists. We want to ensure that multidisciplinary team work occurs across the different specialties in all hospitals.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not clear what the T&aacute;naiste is saying in her reply. Surely she accepts that the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has been discredited&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>She did not answer the question I asked. The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has been discredited in this report. We cannot depend on it to carry out an assessment. Will the T&aacute;naiste or the Health Service Executive carry out the assessment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This has nothing to do with proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have any expertise in this area. It is not a matter for me to carry out the inspections. The Medical Council is the regulatory body for the medical profession and it also approves the training facilities, such as the college of obstetrics. Those bodies have issues which must be examined. I have arranged to meet next week with Dr. Hillary, the president of the council, and his colleagues. I also want to meet representatives of the college. There are clearly issues for the HSE that go beyond the council and the college. I will discuss those matters with the national hospitals office of the HSE shortly. I had a meeting yesterday with one of the representatives of the office who wants to consider the implications of the report for hospital facilities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for meeting Patient Focus and those affected as well as the hospital authorities. Legislation arises from this issue and it is important that the T&aacute;naiste indicate the timeframe involved for the redress board, given that the 25-year neglect is at the heart of this controversy. What is the timeframe for the <Col N="1893"/>medical practitioners Bill on foot of the 1978 Act? Will the legislation that puts the Medical Council on a statutory basis apply more widely than the original Act or will there be separate legislation to deal with the fallout from the report to which the T&aacute;naiste referred?</P>
      <P>Yesterday, Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell described the lack of charities legislation as farcical and I agree with her. Today, Deputy Glennon has been reported as saying that there is no political will in the Government to deal with the problem of alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is written in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not believe everything he reads in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Deputy can clarify the issue with the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to clarify whether the Government is serious about the issue. Dr. Conor Farren stated that if we are depending on the drinks industry for education, we are in a sorry state. Will the sale of alcohol Bill be brought back from exile? Will the T&aacute;naiste give it some time and then put it into exile so that she can apply this voluntary code about which she has spoken before? Is there a trial period after which the situation is reviewed? Alcohol related problems cost us &euro;2.65 billion per annum. It is important that we know how much the alcohol industry is being given to deliver the education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the Bill on medical practitioners legislation will be published between Easter and summer so that people can have an input into defining the legislation before it is published in the autumn. That legislation informed our thinking in advance of this report. When a doctor becomes a consultant in Ireland, he or she is placed on a specialist register and stays on it for the rest of his or her career, unless he or she is struck off for fitness to practice reasons. That is not best practice. Doctors must meet certain competence assurance standards. Part of the legislation will make it a statutory requirement to meet competence assurance standards every few years. That can only be done if one is involved in ongoing training and education and if one&rsquo;s performance is audited. That will be a central part of the legislation and is one of the recommendations in the report.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council is a statutory body but the profession is self-regulated. I want to see a greater input from lay people into the regulation of medics in this country. At the moment there is a huge majority of doctors on the Medical Council and that needs to change for the good of <Col N="1894"/>the profession and to improve public confidence. I have been discussing this with the Medical Council recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>How much time is to be given to the trial period?</P>

	<P>I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on her commitment to implement the recommendations of the publication of the task force report on sudden cardiac deaths. The report stated that we have no good samaritan legislation in Ireland and it called for a review of the situation. Will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment that the Government will introduce such legislation during this D&aacute;il term? I hope she has a more enlightened approach than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Probably the most important power or right ordinary Members of the House have is <Col N="1896"/>to ask a parliamentary question and be guaranteed a reply. I will proceed to promised legislation in a moment but I put down three parliamentary questions on 25 January to the Minister for Health and Children. She referred the questions to this famous section in the HSE that is supposed to answer parliamentary questions. I put down further questions on 16 February asking the Minister when I would get a reply. The replies I received on 16 February stated there was an oversight in referring the questions, that they were inadvertently not referred and that I would get a reply in a couple of days.</P>
      <P>These questions were asked on 25 January. They are straightforward questions. Members are entitled to replies in accordance with the law as established by this House. The unit that is supposed to reply to these questions should do so through the Minister and the House. It is not appropriate that the questions we ask in the House are answered privately, sometimes by telephone. Will the T&aacute;naiste reconsider the section of the Bill that does not require the HSE to answer through her office? If the unit answered through the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s office, the replies would be on the record of the House. It is a major retrograde step for the rights of Members that we cannot ask questions and get replies. It is taking two months to get replies to straightforward questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have had a similar experience. I have received no reply to a question put down on 25 January. The question sought to ascertain the people who are involved in advising the Minister as spin doctors, consultants or media advisers. I do not expect to receive a reply. Interestingly, I put down a question about Naas Hospital around the same time and I was told in the reply that the question was being referred to the parliamentary section of the HSE. However, I got a reply yesterday which stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">The executive has responsibility for considering new capital proposals or progressing those in the health capital programme. Accordingly, my Department is requesting the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and a reply will issue to the Deputy in due course.</P>
      <P FLI="0">A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a long-standing Member of the House, you know that the responsibility rests with the Minister, not with the Health Service Executive, spin doctors or advisers. It rests with nobody other than the person to whom the moneys are voted by this House. I strongly protest at the way the House is being abused.</P><Col N="1897"/>
      <P>Two days ago, I put down a question to three Ministers &mdash; the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Education and Children &mdash; about a serious urgent matter relating to two children who were absent without leave from school and from home. The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science transferred the questions to the Minister for Health and Children, which means I will never get an answer to my question. This is a serious matter; it could affect the health and safety of the children concerned.</P>
      <P>The crowd of goons on the Government benches might think it very funny but this is an abuse of the parliamentary system. Incidentally, I will be coming after the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, shortly about the Dingle programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I wished to raise other points. Will I raise them now or will you call me again, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The points that have been raised by other Deputies are very important. Over the past couple of weeks I have put down questions to the Minister for Health and Children and there has been a long delay in getting replies. I put down a supplementary question asking when the answers would issue. The reply was that the replies would issue that day. It is a magic formula because they issued on that day. It is not a coincidence. That question was the spur that extracted the information. It is bizarre.</P>
      <P>In one of the questions, I sought to highlight the fact that the Minister has now adopted a practice of kicking to touch a greater number of parliamentary questions than any previous Minister for Health and Children. The Department replied that in excess of 45% of all parliamentary questions put down to the Minister are kicked to touch by being referred to the HSE for long delayed responses. In the case of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, the current Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, it was just under 30%. There has been a 50% increase &mdash; from just under 30% to over 45% &mdash; in the number of parliamentary questions to the <Col N="1898"/>Department of Health and Children that are kicked to touch and not replied to officially or properly by the Minister or her Department. The important point is that they are not on the record. This is an important issue. It must be addressed and rectified by the Minister. Members are not raising these issues for the sake of filling the Order of Business; there are many other issues we wish to address.</P>
      <P>Having offered that criticism and asked the T&aacute;naiste to address it, I welcome the report of Patient Focus and those it represents arising from its meeting with the Minister yesterday. I commend the Minister and her Department for meeting the requirements of Patient Focus and the victims of Dr. Neary. I hope the formula for redress which the T&aacute;naiste is due to present shortly will meet with the expectations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of the spokesperson for Patient Focus. I have two questions about legislation. Will there be primary or secondary legislation regarding the proposed severe restrictions on hospital visiting? This is creating tremendous distress for patients, particularly long-stay patients and older and very young patients. It is not good enough to scapegoat visitors for the serious issue of MRSA in our hospitals. That is effectively what the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s recent proposals are about. She should not scapegoat the visitors but take responsibility and deal with the issue.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 5, line 49, after &ldquo;the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;District Court or in the&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment is to allow a cheaper opportunity to adjudicate on matters under the legislation rather than have all matters adjudicated by the Circuit Court and High Court, which, as the Minister of State knows, are much more expensive. I believe that the District Court would be appropriate to a large number of cases and allow people to take cases in a less expensive manner and with a lighter evidential burden, especially regarding predatory pricing and other such very serious matters. Ultimately, they may end up in a higher court through the appeal mechanism, but they should at least start in the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>If accepted, this amendment&rsquo;s impact would be that cases under sections 15C(1), 15C(2) and 15C(3) could be brought to the District Court. However, the District Court cannot grant reliefs such as injunctions and declarations. That is one reason that it would be inappropriate to have this provision. While the authority cannot seek damages, a private party can do so, and the limit on the District Court, as Members are aware, is &euro;6,350, which is very low. In the circum<Col N="1913"/>stances, it would seem unhelpful to people who might wish to use this section that their actions be taken through the District Court. The Circuit Court would be far stronger.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 7 in Deputy Hogan&rsquo;s name arises from committee proceedings. Amendment No. 8 is related and may be taken with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) For the purposes of this section, the cost to the retailer of the grocery goods shall be calculated inclusive of all discounts, rebates or other allowances received by the retailer on the supply of the goods.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We had a good discussion on this on Committee Stage. Retailers, particularly multiples, could have a restriction of offer to eliminate the competition. They would have a supply of goods by quota in a community or locality to stymie the chance of their being available nationally. It should be available nationally and not simply in a small geographical area or community with the intention of engaging in predatory pricing and putting the competition out of business, particularly when safeguards are now being removed, allowing multiples to do as they wish without restriction or quota. Perhaps the Minister of State might comment on that and state how he can prevent the situation from arising where a multiple puts the competition out of business in a given locality without having the same offer available to all consumers nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to state that restrictions on predatory pricing are not being removed by this legislation but strengthened. The first effect of the amendment would be that the same price would be charged in all shops operated by a retailer nationwide. It would impose a national pricing policy, clearly creating some difficulties in local markets. It would distort and prevent competition there, something entirely undesirable in the context of what we are trying to achieve. We are not in the business of creating a national market in groceries. It would be both anti-consumer and anti-competitive.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Hogan said, we had a long debate on this yesterday, and the same issues arise regarding this amendment&rsquo;s impact as would arise in the case of the others. I do not want to go over all that again, but enforcement would be very difficult too, creating a large number of issues not provided for. It would certainly not have the effect of improving the situation from the consumer&rsquo;s perspective.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 10 in the name of Deputy Howlin has been ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s letter to the effect that this amendment is out of order. This matter was discussed on Committee Stage by leave of the Chair and the Minister responded to it. Amendment No. 10 is an amendment to the parent Act, namely, the Competition Act 2002. I presume that it runs foul of the Long Title ruling. Is that where the difficulty arises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It was ruled out of order because it is outside the scope of the Bill. The Bill deals exclusively with the revocation of the groceries order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Ceann Comhairle is aware, this Bill is the Competition (Amendment) Bill and its purpose is to amend the primary Act, namely, the Competition Act 2002. The amendment&rsquo;s purpose is also to amend the primary Act. This is an important issue on which the Minister commented on Committee Stage. While I do not know whether he would allow an adjustment to the Long Title to encompass this amendment, it is important at least to have a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment must be ruled out of order because it is not the Long Title of a Bill, but its contents, that decides whether it is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was discussed on Committee Stage when the Minister referred to, among other things, my raising the fundamental matter of this amendment on the Adjournment. He referred to my speech as being pained, empathetic, outraged and so on. However, I wish to focus strictly on the ruling under discussion, namely, Standing Order 125. Adequate notice was given of this matter on Second Stage and it was discussed substantially on that Stage. When in Government, my understanding was that while a member of the Government takes responsibility for introducing legislation, from the moment it comes before the House, it becomes the property of the House. Standing Order 125 is explicit that matters which are discussed substantially on Second Stage &mdash; this was done on Second Stage in this case &mdash; and which are again referred to on Committee Stage are relevant to the Bill in question. The suggestion that one can, as it were, resile to the Title by way of exclusion of the amendment is unacceptable. While I have no difficulty in living with Standing Orders, my understanding is that Standing Order 125 covers this situation.</P>
      <P>While I am anxious to be as co-operative as possible in this respect, I will make a point. This amendment would insert a new section, section <Col N="1915"/>4A, into the Competition Act 2002. While it was open to the sponsors of the legislation, that is, the Government, to call it the groceries order amendment Bill if it wished, it did not do so. It called it the Competition (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      <P>As for the manner in which this is discussed, a further problem arises. During the debate on the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act, it was explicitly stated that when a similar amendment was inserted, such an amendment belonged by way of revision to the competition legislation.</P>
      <P>By the way, very unhelpful remarks were made concerning this legislation on Committee Stage, including, for example, one which suggested that people with views similar to mine assume that all actors are poor, all barristers are rich and so on. That was a shameful remark. My remarks on the Adjournment and on Committee Stage were made on the basis of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we cannot go back over Committee Stage. The position on Amendment No. 10 is that the Chair has ruled it out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I see that Standing Order 125 states that amendments may be taken provided such amendments are relevant to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely. This is the Competition (Amendment) Bill and the amendment inserts a section in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment was ruled out of order on the basis that it was not relevant. We will move on to the next amendment. The Deputy has been afforded a good opportunity to make a point. Normally, we should simply move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I know we should. However, normally the Government should introduce legislation under the proper title and the limitation should be expressed substantially. It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are moving on to amendment No. 11 in the name of Deputy Howlin. As amendment No. 12 is related, amendments Nos. 11 and 12 will be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope there will be a legal challenge on this issue which the legislation could have avoided. This will be my last remark.

	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 7, to delete lines 3 and 4.</P>
      <P FLI="0">As the Ceann Comhairle noted, amendment No. 12 is related. This is simply a technical amendment. It seems to me on simple reading that subsection 5(2) states that insofar as it is unrepealed, the Restrictive Practices Act 1972 is repealed. The Bill&rsquo;s Schedule includes all the enactments which are to be repealed and it seems to me that the Restrictive Practices Act 1972 belongs in that list. I am uncertain that the reason given to me on Committee Stage by the Minister is in any way valid because section 6 of the Bill provides him with the ability to bring in any section of the Bill, or any part of the Bill, at his pleasure after its enactment. It seems to me that it would be more properly and logically located in the manner I suggest rather than in the way presented by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s point and what his amendment tries to achieve. Under normal circumstances, his point would undoubtedly be correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>These must be abnormal circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is somewhat unusual, in the sense that the Bill will only come into force as a result of a commencement order under section 6(3). The intention is that section 5(2) will not be commenced until all proceedings in train pursuant to the 1972 Act have been disposed of. Once that happens, a second commencement order will be introduced to give effect to section 5(2). The Bill has been drafted in this form to facilitate the making of the necessary confirmation orders in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I still do not understand the logic, inasmuch as the Minister may bring in any section of the Bill at his pleasure. Someone wishing to establish what provisions have been repealed by it will examine the Schedule. However, the repeal of the Restrictive Practices Act will not be noted in the Schedule. This seems to be both inelegant and confusing for potential readers of the Bill and contrary to the normal Standing Orders to the effect that all Bills should be clearly read. While I do not see why the Minister&rsquo;s purpose could not be achieved by the amendment, I will not exercise myself overmuch in this respect. Does the Minister of State not grasp my point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support amendments Nos. 11 and 12. I am afraid the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s amendments is in keeping with the Department&rsquo;s attitude to this <Col N="1917"/>legislation. It seems to me that it wishes to create <i>&agrave; la carte</i> legislation from which it can pick and choose at will. Members were informed on Committee Stage that the previous amendment, namely, amendment No. 10, could only be dealt with in the context of the Industrial Relations Acts. However, this is not the case because, clearly, the Competition Authority was established under the Competition Act and this Bill pertains to that Act. Hence, the Government&rsquo;s attitude has been very unhelpful in this regard and does not lead to proper legislation.</P>
      <P>At present, many freelance workers do not have the right to be collectively represented and effectively are being treated as though they were companies. This position is unacceptable and the amendment would have helped to resolve it. Within the context of this Bill, there was clear provision to deal with this issue and it is most unfortunate that Members have been misled on some occasions and misrepresented on others, as have the workers. As Deputy Michael D. Higgins has noted, workers have been accused of being well off in certain circumstances. I support these two amendments and hope the Minister of State will be somewhat more forthright in his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position I outlined does not arise from any particular preference in the Department or, indeed, on the part of the Minister. The legal advice was that this was the appropriate way to set them down. We looked again at them because I understood the import of what Deputy Howlin stated on Committee Stage and again on Report Stage. Frankly, I thought the logic of what he stated was strong but the legal advice is that this is the better way to format it.</P>

    <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the enactment of this legislation on Fifth Stage for the various reasons that were pointed out on Second Stage and Committee Stage by all sides of the House. It is an unusual situation where all sides of the House are almost in agreement, but the Government is ploughing ahead with this legislation irrespective of the views expressed on all Stages. It is rather strange that not even a technical amendment was offered by the Government side to show it cares about some of the views expressed on Second Stage. It is rather dismissive of all views contrary to the position of the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, indicated at the time of the abolition of the groceries order in November 2005 that he was prepared to listen to <Col N="1918"/>various views and was prepared to put certain sections into the Competition Act which would protect the interests of consumers and which would ensure rebates and discounts were passed on to them but which would not allow a situation that would concentrate the market in the hands of a few. By opening up the legislation in the manner in which he has to ensure there are no proper safeguards on predatory pricing, he is putting at risk competition in the local marketplace in the sale of goods and services, allowing big business to supersede all other arguments over small business, and putting at risk the indigenous food and other interests which supply small and big business in this country.</P>
      <P>This is a retrograde step in the absence of the protections and the clarification under law required to ensure predatory pricing was banned. If the Minister had no difficulty about the banning of predatory pricing under section 5 of the Competition Act 2002, he should have no problem whatsoever in accepting the views expressed by his backbenchers and the Opposition by inserting an amendment to ensure that what he had stated was, in fact, what the position would be and to give absolute clarity to the issue of predatory pricing in line with what all of us in this House would like to see happening. That was not forthcoming and the obstinate and stubborn manner in which the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has insisted on this legislation going through does him no service and, unfortunately, does competition in this country no service either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is based on populism. There was an outcry about stealth taxes and rising prices in this country last year which, I suppose, was captured most definitively by the work of Mr. Hobbs on television. The Minister&rsquo;s response was not to look at genuine cartels, at what was happening among some of the professions or to take on real vested interest, but by way of populism to make an issue of the 1987 groceries order. The groceries order, which has stood the test of time through successive Administrations of all political hues for 18 years and was found useful by all Administrations, and which was introduced originally by former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was hardly a rampant socialist, served its purpose.</P>
      <P>I thought my analysis of the impact on prices, on Second Stage and over the duration of this Bill, provided a compelling enough case that this was not the appropriate target. It was not even responded to.</P>
      <P>For nine of the 18 years prices covered by the groceries order increased less than prices not covered and for the balance, all but for the past two years, there was virtually no difference in prices. The notion that this was some significant anti-competitive device recently discovered was bizarre and unproven and no evidence, least of <Col N="1919"/>all the tome published by the Minister as justification last year, proved that point. In fact, all shades of opinion across the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which looked at it felt that if ever there was a document that came to its conclusions first and then built the arguments around the conclusions, the Minister&rsquo;s document was it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in search of populism, is taking grave risks. The real issues voiced by experienced Deputies, former Ministers like the former Minister of State, Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, Deputy Cassidy, as well as Members across the Opposition benches, were reasoned, sensible, knowledgeable arguments none of which were faced up to or argued against by the Minister. If one reads every utterance of the Minister since he first announced the abolition of the groceries order, as I tried to do, the general view is that he knew in his heart, just like de Valera, that this was the right measure. There is a certain irony, therefore, that it is a successor of de Valera in the constituency of Clare who is left holding the can today. I suppose a burden shared is a burden halved and when those particular chickens come home with bird influenza there will be more than one Minister to carry the can.</P>
      <P>This is populist. The notion, from the Competition Authority or from the Minister originally, was that there would be a definitive reduction in grocery prices on foot of this to counterbalance the dangers of predatory pricing, building of dominance, crushing of competition and reduction of choice. Given the case made by such radical organisations as CROSSCARE or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which made a compelling case to the committee, the Minister has now abandoned any notion that there will be a quantifiable reduction in grocery prices because he knows we will be measuring and the CSO, which provided us with useful information last year, will be brought back at the end of this year. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, would give us the yardstick by which to judge and in the concluding phase of this debate would tell us by how much he expects this legislation to reduce the cost of the grocery basket during the course of 2006. If he is so confident that this is the right measure, he should give us that yardstick.</P>
      <P>There is no point in me taking up the time of the House anymore. We have made a compelling case. I approached this debate from the start with an open mind. If there was a compelling case I was willing to hear it. The Minister has reinstated many of the provisions of what he wanted characterised as a discredited groceries order. He has reinstated many of the provisions dealing with hello money and other issues. He has not, in my view and in the view of Deputies on this side of the House, dealt effectively with the issue of predatory pricing. He has trusted in European <Col N="1920"/>law and European Court decisions to do so. That is a dangerous area to leave unregulated to a satisfactory extent.</P>
      <P>I hope my analysis is wrong. I hope it will not lead to increased dominance by one or two big players in the Irish market, the exclusion of choice, the destruction of the small player in the market, and people who are dependent on public transport or who are elderly being totally disadvantaged having to shop in five, ten or 15 years&rsquo; time in major hypermarkets on the fringes of our towns rather than in community facilities available at affordable prices as is generally the position at present.</P>

That does not make the case to amend the legislation. The consumer will lose out in the short term. The problems in the UK have not been recognised here. The report on the groceries order has many flaws and can be rubbished significantly but it is the basis for change in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The consumer will lose out because cartels will operate in the food industry. The two finest indigenous food production counties are Monaghan and Cavan, which the Ceann Comhairle represents, and they will also be losers. The Danish food industry is in major trouble because of the cartoon issue, which is regrettable. Danish products have been taken off the shelves in the Middle East and flown back to Denmark at a major loss to Arla Foods, the major food manufacturer in Scandinavia. Some of these products found their way on to Irish shelves last week, which led to the withdrawal of Irish and British products because they were being sold at a higher margin. This is what will happen to the detriment of small domestic producers and the food industry, which is a relatively small player in the European Union.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Large multiples will be the way forward. Since I took an interest in this issue, I have been unable to cope with the number of telephone calls and newspaper cuttings I have received. <i>Countryview</i>, a British magazine, recently published an article under the headline, &ldquo;Time to protect small shops from supermarket dominance&rdquo;. The reporter, Joanna Baker, stated: &ldquo;A stronger code of practice to protect supermarket suppliers, together with the need for an independent retail regulator and a moratorium on any further supermarket mergers and takeovers, were just three of the recommendations MPs made in the &lsquo;High Street UK 2015&rsquo; report...&rdquo;. Today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> carries a story under the headline, &ldquo;America&rsquo;s shoppers get selective&rdquo; in which it is stated, &ldquo;Consumers are adopting a pick-and-mix attitude towards supermarkets. Tesco and Wal-Mart take note...&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1921"/>
      <P>The groceries order report states Germany, which has the lowest food price inflation of the 15 member states, does not have a ban on below cost selling but this is false, as such a ban is in place. The report makes no distinction between symbol groups and multiple stores. The owners of symbol stores are independent retailers who voluntarily link to a symbol group. The symbol group relationships can be broken, generally with three months notice. It is false to only examine the sales of the symbol wholesaler and not to take into account that these are independent retailers, each making his or her own decisions on how they operate their stores. Independent retailers have a higher market share outside Dublin and prices outside Dublin are consistently lower than those in the capital, according to the CSO. In other words, prices are cheaper in rural Ireland than in Dublin because we have the market.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The report states that in the period since 1996 the rate of inflation in Ireland has been three times that in the UK and almost twice the EU average. This is misleading and, in isolation, gives a false picture of Irish inflation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> UK inflation. UK food inflation is higher. Another study should be undertaken and the report should be rewritten. The report claims that the countries with a ban on below cost selling have the highest rate of inflation, which is also false. It fails to mention that, according to the EUROSTAT price level indices, a number of the countries with a ban on below cost selling have the lowest food prices in the EU.</P>
      <P>The report rubbishes claims that seven out of ten villages in the UK have no local shops, yet the statistics clearly demonstrate this is the case. More than 70% of towns and villages with up to 1,000 inhabitants have no local shop. Villages such as Rathcormac, near Fermoy, and Kildorrery in my constituency had five or six shops but they are no more, even though each has 1,000 inhabitants on the electoral register. This is a serious scenario. The Department&rsquo;s report quotes an Office of Fair Trading report which has since been withdrawn and a new report is being prepared.</P>
      <P>The Department&rsquo;s report fails to mention that the entry of Aldi and Lidl to the Irish market was facilitated by the existence of the groceries order. Without the order, Dunnes and Tesco would almost certainly have targeted the products being sold by Aldi and Lidl for below cost selling activity with a view to eliminating these discounters before they gained a significant market share. On predatory pricing and abuse of dominance, the report recommends that the existing provisions of the Competition Act 2002 should deal with predatory pricing. The report acknowledges that the Competition Act 2002 can only deal with cases where the retailer has a share of 35% of the market or more and that none of the retailers have this level of market share. Nevertheless, it argues that the Competition Act 2002 can provide a safeguard for independent retailers against <Col N="1922"/>predatory pricing. This is obviously false. In addition, the report gives the impression that the Competition Authority has been represented on abuse of dominance cases. The Competition Authority has not forwarded files to the DPP on such investigations and no company has been prosecuted for abuse of dominance. There is no reason to believe the authority will change this stance in the future.</P>
      <P>Competition between firms is important. Firms comprise individuals who manage and operate them. The report makes no attempt to analyse competition with respect to the ambitions of the market participants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy would love to be over here where I am. He has tried hard and failed.</P>
      <P>The food industry is a key sector here in terms of employment and trade. More than 210,000 people are employed in the production, distribution and sale of food. A total of 65,000 are employed in the retail grocery trade. The Minister of State&rsquo;s heart is in what we are doing because he comes from the same background as myself. He has inherited this legislation. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was successful in the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children and we are reaping the fruits of his work in the latter Department with his successor implementing his policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is clutching at straws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am extremely disappointed with the way this legislation has been stream-rolled through the House. The Minister of State acknowledged that a significant number of amendments were logical and would have been beneficial but they were not accepted. I am afraid we are handing over the entire grocery trade to big business at the expense of small traders. Nobody will contest the theories on consolidation and economy of scale but small Irish towns and villages will be completely bereft of a grocery service to their inhabitants, who comprise pensioners, families on low incomes and others who do not have transport. They will be expected to travel more than ten miles to a super store to purchase their goods at rip-off prices once the small traders are despatched.</P><Col N="1923"/>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill has clear deficiencies. The definitions of &ldquo;predatory pricing&rdquo;, &ldquo;market dominance&rdquo; and so on have not been dealt with adequately and this legislation has been exposed on all Stages of its passage regarding these issues. That is most unacceptable. The Government has caved in and amended legislation to facilitate IKEA while legislation has also been amended to facilitate incineration companies. In this instance, legislation is being amended to facilitate the grocery trade while further changes will result following the passage of the major infrastructure Bill. People in small towns and villages such as Shercock, Hackballscross and Ballyjamesduff in the north east will not have basic grocery services because of lobbying by big business, which the Government has fallen for again, and that is most unfortunate.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has also missed a significant opportunity to deal with the issue of freelance workers and their right to be collectively represented. They are not high fliers swanning about on our television screens. They are poor people struggling to eke out a living, whether they are freelance journalists, actors, playwrights and so on. There was duplicity in the debate. A Minister told us the appropriate legislation for such change would be the Industrial Relations Act. That is not the case. The Competition Authority, which used a block in this instance, was established under the Competition Bill. This Bill could have adequately dealt with this important issue for significant numbers of people. It is unfortunate that opportunity was not taken. I am disappointed by that and therefore oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Fifth Stage. What the Minister has done with regard to this legislation is to give a blank cheque to large retailers here, many of them multinational retailers, to wipe out the smaller players within the industry, squeeze the consumer and ensure retailers get even larger returns than they do currently. What are the annual profits of these large multinationals and major retailers, for example, Dunnes Stores, Superquinn or Tesco? These profits are not disclosed to the public and this gives rise to serious questions.</P>
      <P>While we all accept the groceries order was outdated, some key elements of it benefited consumers. The Minister of State may argue that this legislation is pro-consumer but that it does not allow for rebates or discounts to be passed on to the consumer means it is anti-consumer. No safeguards are in the legislation with regard to predatory pricing which is anti-consumer and anti rural Ireland. This legislation is bad for rural Ireland, the elderly and those on the poverty line. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is very much against it for that reason.</P>
      <P>Significant numbers of people in rural areas do not have their own transport, nor, thanks to the <Col N="1924"/>Government, access to public transport. They will not have access to basic foodstuffs in their local community or village shop as a result of this legislation. In recent years the Government has closed down much of our post office network. Now, this legislation will close many of our rural shops and on the edge of major towns we will see massive supermarkets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a Second Stage speech again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief. Every other EU country has taken the opposite position to the one we are taking. They are introducing, or have introduced, measures similar to the groceries order. We have seen the retail wastelands that exist in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>This legislation is bad for producers, farmers and suppliers. A survey conducted by Fine Gael last summer highlighted the fact that there is a mark-up of up to 214% on basic food products from the farm gate to the supermarket shelf. The middleman does not benefit from this. Those who benefit are the major retailers. They make huge profits and put the squeeze on smaller retailers, suppliers and primary producers such as farmers. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider his position on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle will be pleased to hear that I will be brief. A very interesting confrontation of ideas, worthy of note, took place during the course of this legislation. It was between an unelected, but appointed, lobby group, the consumer strategy group, and the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, an elected body nominated by this House. As every speaker, both Government and Opposition indicated, the elected representatives spoke about competition and choice in the broadest sense. They spoke about the social consequences of the absence of retailing activity and the economic effects that are beyond the issue of price. The consumer strategy group took an extraordinarily narrow view of retailing, construing it entirely in terms of what has been suggested, namely, an assumed benefit on price, unexpressed in terms of outcomes with regard to time and heavily reliant on assumptions that are proven to not exist, such as assumptions of perfect market.</P>
      <P>In that sense we had a very narrow distorted debate on citizen choice, the future structure of retailing, the embedding of retailing in a social and economic milieu and distinctions of rural life in transition to conditions of urban life. These were the legitimate considerations of the committee. On the other hand, the unelected group decided it would go for where it saw its chance, and that is what happened. The second group of people, the Competition Authority, was shown to be informing the debate on a flawed statistical basis to which it never replied.</P><Col N="1925"/>
      <P>The point has been made by me, Deputy Morgan, my colleague Deputy Howlin and others that this was an opportunity to amend the Competition Act. Unfortunately, during the debate on Committee Stage we had a distortion of Article 85.1, a misinterpretation of the European Commission&rsquo;s position and a misinterpretation of European competition law. The suggestion that was made during Committee Stage was unfortunate. I have said enough about it and may have been unparliamentary previously on the matter.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Frankly, the suggestion that the owner of a pharmacy is in the same position as a freelance actor who is selling his or her services is wrong. There is an obvious distinction. There is continuity in the asset in one case &mdash; the person is selling the same thing under known and predictable conditions which he or she controls. The business is therefore appropriately regarded as an undertaking or commodity. I do not agree with the idea that freelance musicians, journalists, photographers and artists etc. are the same. The example the Minister quoted on Committee Stage involved a ruling in a European Union case concerning opera singers. If he had further investigated the case, he would have found that the case dealt with a company selling operatic services. Therefore, it was legitimately called an undertaking, but not the opera singer.</P>
      <P>I find it unfortunate that on Committee Stage my name was mentioned and quoted from an Adjournment Debate. I was described as pained. I stated I had one interest in this matter, namely that my wife is a founder member of the Stanislavsky Studio and a member of Equity. I have known actors, writers and musicians for all of my adult life. This is how I know of the precariousness of their lives. The unworthy suggestion that mine was an instinctive reaction from people who assume that all artists are poor and all barristers are rich is an unworthy statement to put on the record of the D&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>I am left in the position where I will now advise the trade unions that are taking part in social partnership not to proceed with any talks unless the Trade Union Act 1941 is amended. We had two choices. It is strictly within the ambit of this legislation at this stage that it could have amended through a new section 4A something that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude. It undermines the International Labour Organisation convention of 1988 and the entire corpus of trade union legislation. We will now proceed, in the fact that this legislation will be law, with the issue unaddressed. Our only choice is to lobby publicly for the change in the Trade Union Act 1941 and to encourage artists to proceed with the court cases they were forced to abandon on the steps of the court. That is what I will recommend.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has its head in the sand on this issue. In that position one cannot see, and if the head is deep enough in the sand one cannot hear. This is a chronic case of Government tipping its hat to big business. The Minister has allowed himself to be led by advisers and has consequently taken advice that has no basis in fact and no foundation. There is no demand for this legislation. The Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business knows there is no demand because it has the proof. It invited various representatives to its meetings and not one of the groups or individuals put forward a request for a revocation of the groceries order. That is the proof. This legislation is bad for the consumer and rural Ireland and will be proven so.</P>

	<P>They are no less valid for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important to realise that some of the amendments put forward would have had the effect of undermining section 5 of the Competition Act 2002, which would have gone against everything said by many people. The Government was accused of populism amid concerns about stealth taxes and rising prices. There are no stealth taxes. Any taxes which are imposed <Col N="1927"/>are done so through this House or by local authorities in an open and transparent manner, so they cannot be described as stealth taxes.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>The issue of rising prices is one which is clearly of concern to the Government. It is not my fault if it is not of concern to those on the Opposition benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is unworthy of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should not blame Mr. Albert Reynolds for bringing in the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of speakers asserted that the reason I am here is that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, did not wish to deal with this, but I want to address that point. People are aware of the nature of the business being undertaken by the Minister at this point and of the success which his trip to the United States has brought. He would have had no difficulty in being here, no more than I have a difficulty now in representing him.</P>

	<P>The issue of the United Kingdom experience was also mentioned and the lessons to be drawn from that are quite different to those that many people are drawing. The <i>de facto</i> position in the country up to now was that wholesalers were effectively deciding minimum retail prices. There were some advantages for some people in that but there were none for consumers or for small retail businesses.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morgan referred to the fact that I said one of the amendments tabled seemed logical to me. It did seem logical to me but I am not a legal person and the strong legal advice was otherwise. I am prepared to accept the legal advice because I do not claim to be a legal expert of any kind.</P><Col N="1928"/>

      <P>Deputy Naughten made the interesting and important point that, heretofore, suppliers, and he was concerned about farm suppliers, had their product marked up by 214%. At the same time, he argued that we should maintain the situation that allowed that to happen. We need to address that very strongly.</P>

He also spoke about Article 85.1 and the European Commission position with regard to the actors&rsquo; union, Equity, and others. The Deputy may be misunderstanding the point that was made with regard to rich actors and poor barristers and he has a concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The point that was being made is that while this matter is of concern to many of us, and I have previously indicated that it is of concern to me, it has not been possible heretofore to find a means of addressing it which would not result in those who need to have their situation examined and dealt with being the sole beneficiaries. Others who have no such need would also benefit. If a formula can be found to address that, I am sure the Government will examine it carefully and charitably. I certainly would be prepared to consider it, but it is not a matter for me to consider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>He also asked me to point out something which I have great pleasure in doing, namely, that the groceries order was the principal <Col N="1931"/>factor in driving price competition out of the grocery market for the period since 1987. It did this by creating mechanisms of discounts and rebates which allowed suppliers to fix minimum prices below which most grocery products could not be sold. Everybody knows that is the case.</P>

	<P>I can understand why Deputies would not wish to hear what I have to say. We have heard repetition from all sides and I am simply responding to that. The groceries order had a disastrous impact and this legislation seeks to address the issues which were causing concern in that regard. The Competition Act of 2002 has had many benefits. Some concerns have been expressed regarding that legislation which cannot be addressed in this context but can be addressed in another. The Minister has indicated that he intends to have a well resourced Competition Authority looking after the provisions of this legislation and the 2002 Competition Act.</P>

    <Title>Building Control Bill 2005: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>S&eacute;amus Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Naughten was in possession. He has eight minutes remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Previously I was making the point that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have a role in decisions on major housing developments to ensure that development does not take place in a manner that facilitates anti-social behaviour. Planners in my local authority have jeered and sneered at me for bringing to their attention a number of developments in which anti-social behaviour is facilitated by the design of green spaces that are not overlooked by the windows of any houses. Research on anti-social behaviour in different developments shows, and all the top architects in the world will confirm, the importance of ensuring that public open spaces are overlooked by the windows of surrounding properties as that provides necessary security. Sadly, that has not happened in some parts of the country.</P>
      <P>On a different topic, another problem is the tendency in some parts of the west to allow a montage of brightly coloured houses in housing estates. That is completely contrary to the building standards that were in place heretofore. For example, a number of housing estates in County Roscommon have houses that are bright red, yellow or blue. If the housing in any village in <Col N="1934"/>County Roscommon was painted in that manner, the village would be deducted points in the tidy towns competition. In places such as County Roscommon and many of the midlands counties, the housing is of a very plain style without the bright colours that are seen in parts of Munster. It is a pity that local authorities are allowing such developments to establish themselves in counties such as Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Another issue I want to highlight is development contributions. I am aware of one development in the south Roscommon area for which the developer handed over &euro;2 million to the local authority, which has not spent one cent of that money in that local electoral area. I appreciate that local authorities need to pool development contributions and spend the money throughout the county rather than just in the area where the development is taking place, but it is critical that part of the contribution is ring-fenced for the local area to provide it with amenities and services that are not currently available.</P>
      <P>Similarly, we need a methodology for the calculation of development contributions throughout the country. For example, as spokesperson for agriculture, I am aware that some local authorities demand development contributions for the construction of farmyard buildings for which farmers will be able to claim waste management grants. In some areas those grants will be eaten up by local authority development contributions whereas in other areas such developments are exempt from contributions. We need some standardisation across the board because the current situation is confusing for business and developers. The process needs to be more streamlined.</P>
      <P>Part 2 of the Bill will strengthen the enforcement powers of building control authorities. Building control is in a mess and is a complete <Col N="1935"/>joke. If the developer of a facility does a runner, funds are not available for the local authority to take charge of the facility. The Government needs to examine the issue of enforcement because the existing legislation is wholly inadequate to deal with such situations.</P>
      <P>One issue that infuriates me, although it is a small matter, is the names given to some housing estates. I cannot understand how names such as &ldquo;Tudor Lawns&rdquo; get through the planning process. Many such names are English ones superimposed on Irish developments and this should not be tolerated. Developments should utilise local names rather than names which are alien not only to the areas in question but also to the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>Developers have a responsibility to provide local authorities with the proper Irish translation of the names of their developments. Although we have Irish language officers, disputes can arise in some cases regarding Irish translations of particular estates. The Irish translations of the names of housing estates should therefore be clarified at an early stage by developers when they are submitting their proposals to the local authorities. They should submit sensible names for their housing estates and include the Irish translations so people will know them. Disputes over translations can be messy in some cases and they would not arise if a sensible approach were taken in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Discussing this Bill is useless unless we have proper resources to enforce it. The area planner of my local authority took up office on 1 January 2006 and, although I have left numerous messages for that person every week, we have still not spoken. It is unacceptable in this day and age that certain public officials are not prepared to respond to elected councillors or Members of the Oireachtas in respect of planning queries and provide clarity. As bad as the Department of Health and Children is, which subject we debated previously, the local authority structure, especially the structure of planning offices, is appalling by comparison. This is not just the case in my local authority because colleagues from other local authority areas have told me they experience the exact same difficulties. Some officials almost believe it is an honour for one to be rung by them to respond to a query.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Part of the problem is the lack of planners in local authorities to deal with planning cases on a day-to-day basis. The position on enforcement is appalling, and wholly inadequate resources are being made available in this regard. Staff are being stolen from enforcement offices to engage in day-to-day planning because there are statutory obligations in respect of planning.</P>
      <P>Last Monday a constituent of mine rang me about a sand hill that was being removed by a developer. I contacted the planning enforcement section and discovered there was no planning permission to remove it but the staff said they could <Col N="1936"/>do nothing unless my complaint was put in writing. By the time my letter would reach the local authority, the hill would be removed. What is happening is stupid and unless adequate resources are in place, talking about this legislation will only make a farce of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is impressive, far-reaching and progressive and it encompasses a very wide range of issues, including fire safety, climate change and industry registration. The Minister should be congratulated on bringing it forward and addressing so many concerns in one fell swoop. The Bill is multifaceted and yet it is cohesive. Each section is deserving of a speech in itself. There is not a single person in this country that the Bill, when enacted, will not affect. Its provisions for the implementation of the directive on energy performance in buildings and its consideration of global greenhouse gas levels serve as a case in point.</P>
      <P>As all Members are aware, the stricter controls on fire safety contained in this Bill are being proposed close to the 25th anniversary of the Stardust tragedy. This appalling event is a black mark on the history of this State and, as a public representative for Artane and surrounding areas, I have experienced at first hand the heartbreak and suffering it has caused. I welcome the recent discussions provoked by the landmark anniversary of the disaster and hope they will eventually lead to some kind of closure on the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a new inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise in the context of this Bill but I have called for a commission of inquiry. I will pursue this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair play to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems the details of that horrific night have been gleaned annually since 1981 and, every year at about this time, recommendations of the tribunal which have yet to be implemented are highlighted and new fire safety measures are called for. On the 20th anniversary of the tragedy, the fact that the prosecution of a pub or club owner for breach of fire regulations entailed taking a case to the Circuit Court rather than the lower District Court was underlined by certain people in the fire services. The Bill addresses that concern and simplifies the prosecution process. Prosecution in the District Court is opened up as an option to local building control authorities.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we have come a long way since 1981. The annual running cost of the fire service is now in the order of &euro;250 million and Dublin alone makes up for &euro;90 million of this sum. Since 1981, the State has provided the fire service with almost &euro;240 million in capital funding, including &euro;19 million this year alone. A major refurbishment of the Dublin fire brigade training <Col N="1937"/>centre at Marino, the O&rsquo;Brien Institute, to the tune of &euro;20 million, is at an advanced stage of planning and I hope the Minister will give this project swift approval so the work can begin.</P>
      <P>Existing legislation in this area includes the Fire Services Act 1981, the Building Control Act 1990, the precursor to this Bill, and the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003. All these had their merits. The 1981 Act was passed in the immediate aftermath of the Stardust tragedy and it imposed statutory responsibility upon persons in control of buildings to take precautions to prevent the outbreak of fire, and to ensure the safety of persons on the premises in the event of a fire. It also provided for inspections to be undertaken by fire authorities and, as a result, more than 13,000 inspections of almost 10,000 premises were carried out in 2004.</P>
      <P>The Building Control Bill 2005 enforces existing legislation regarding the fire safety certificate process. If this Bill is enacted, the use of non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks will be entirely disallowed without the relevant certification. Given the prospective financial implications, I am sure this will, as intended, deter developers from shirking their responsibilities in this regard. However, we must keep reminding ourselves of the lessons learned from the Stardust tragedy. Laws that are passed must, first and foremost, be enforced and people must be aware of the requirements of the law.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">Last August, 15 people were evacuated from a burning building on Ormond Quay in Dublin. There was no fire escape in the block of nine apartments and the fire blocked the only exit. Thanks to the work of the emergency services, there were no fatalities. However, the case should not have arisen in the first place. In the wake of the event, a spokeswoman for Dublin City Council told <i>The Irish Times</i> that building regulations required all new or newly renovated buildings to have fire certificates but she was unable to state the position on fire safety certificates for older buildings. I am pleased this Bill does not discriminate between old and new apartment blocks. Enforcement is gravely important when issues of safety are in question but implementation must precede enforcement. I am aware that aspects of the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003, about which I spoke in this Chamber more than three years ago, have yet to be put into operation. Discussions with the entertainment industry and fire authority experts on the licensing of indoor events by local authorities are ongoing. This is not satisfactory and I hope it will be resolved soon.</P>
      <P>We know from the Stardust tribunal that the designing of buildings by unqualified people poses a real danger to the public. Like other people, when I come across newly published Bills I am sometimes surprised by the issues which arise from them. That people can arrive on these shores and refer to themselves as architects, <Col N="1938"/>regardless of their qualifications, is totally unacceptable and unsafe. People have been demanding since the foundation of the State that this glaring negligence be remedied. In my research, I discovered that a staggering 80% of the complaints made to the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland in 2004 related to work being done by people who were unqualified. Stories of rogue builders are not just urban myths. This Bill provides for the registration of the titles of &ldquo;architect&rdquo;, &ldquo;building surveyor&rdquo; and &ldquo;quantity surveyor&rdquo;, which will help to boost consumer confidence in the industry. It is significant that the Bill has the full endorsement of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, the Association of Building Engineers and the Building Regulations Advisory Body.</P>
      <P>The architecture industry is spending a great deal of time in the public eye because the Government is continuing to provide record levels of housing and debates on urbanisation are broadening and becoming more intense. My experience as a representative of the Dublin North-Central constituency and as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government has taught me that planning is a major issue. People are increasingly seeking to build apartment blocks rather than houses. Apartments constituted 68% of all housing units built in the city of Dublin in 2004. I am greatly concerned about some of the issues which arise from that. The provision that management companies be established is a fairly new phenomenon in the granting of planning permission to apartment complexes. Developers are required to establish management companies and subsequently to transfer the responsibilities of such bodies to residents who become responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of services within the boundaries of complexes. If they choose to retain such responsibilities, it can be quite daunting for people without previous experience in this area to deal with problems relating to water, drainage and lighting etc. Such responsibilities can cause real headaches for people who already have full-time jobs.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note recently that Dublin City Council has established a residential section with responsibility for issues that can arise in the private rented sector, with particular regard to apartment complexes. The new section will support management companies by giving them advice on how best to fulfil their responsibilities and give some kind of structure to the system. It is comforting for one to learn that the services of professional management companies can be availed of, until one also learns that the city council has no responsibility or authority to ensure that management companies provide services to adequate standards. There are no standards for the provision of services to housing and apartment complexes, even though such complexes have become a large part of the answer to our housing problem. The Minister for Justice, <Col N="1939"/>Equality and Law Reform recently published a report in which a review group recommended that auctioneering, estate agency, property letting and property management agencies be licensed and regulated. I remind Deputies that in 2004, 80% of all complaints made to the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland related to work done by people who were unqualified. The House is addressing that problem today. I hope similar provisions will be made soon in respect of bodies operating in the private residential sector. I look forward to debating such legislation in the near future.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, I am familiar with the EU energy performance in buildings directive, which has been the subject of healthy debate at many of the committee&rsquo;s meetings. I am delighted that the directive is being transposed into Irish law in the Bill. The enactment of part L of the building regulations, which relates to the thermal performance and insulation standards of buildings, will reduce the energy required to heat a domestic dwelling by between 23% and 33%, depending on the size and type of dwelling. This significant reduction in energy requirements will have a knock-on effect on the cost of heating, which will decrease by approximately &euro;188 per annum, and will add to the cumulative effect of the amendments to part L regulations, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 400,000 tonnes a year by 2012.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation, the energy performance of buildings will be measured by a building energy rating system and assessed by building professionals who are registered in accordance with the Bill. It is appropriate and necessary that the new rating system will be introduced on a phased basis over the next three years. Although technical guidance documents are available to those involved in the building industry, the new system has the potential to cause confusion among home owners and buyers. I hope a sustained awareness campaign will be initiated over the coming years to reassure people and inform them of their duties and the requirements under EU law. The implementation of the action plan that has been put in place on foot of our adoption of the EU energy performance in buildings directive will have a massive impact on the health of our environment.</P>
      <P>The measures in this Bill have huge significance for Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Our current building output is set to continue. The demand for housing is starting to be met by supply. Figures released by the Environmental Protection Agency two weeks ago show that greenhouse gas emissions rose slightly in 2004. The increase of 7% in emissions in the residential sector can be accounted for in part by the housing boom and the increase in this country&rsquo;s population. The residential sector produces just over 10% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emis<Col N="1940"/>sions, which makes it the fourth highest contributor. The third highest contributor is the transport sector, which produces 17.5% of our greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions of the transport sector, which is a victim of current social trends, increased by 6% from 2003 to 2004.</P>
      <P>I urge the Government to work harder to increase the practicality of the use of biofuels, which entered our market recently. There are strong indications that biofuels could become commercially viable within two years. A number of pilot projects in this regard are under way in Dublin. I would like more major companies to prepare feasibility studies on the prospective use of such environmentally friendly fuels. The emissions levels in the transport sector, which have increased significantly on a sustained basis, are well over double what they were in 1990. Given that innovation and adjustment are important in this regard, I am pleased that section 5 of the Bill, which relates to alternative energy systems for large buildings, requires that any person proposing the construction of a building with a floor area exceeding 1,000 sq. m. must ensure that research into the use of alternative energy systems for the building is prepared and consolidated into a feasibility study with the intention of putting it into practice. This is an innovative and positive approach to environmental matters and to planning law. It is particularly notable in the context of the recent relaxation of the retail planning guidelines which opened the possibility of large-scale retail outlets being designed and built.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have merely skimmed the full implications of the Bill, but this is clearly impressive and commendable legislation. It is multifaceted and innovative, yet it is workable. It has raised other issues that need to be addressed and I look forward to seeing them examined shortly in these Houses in legislative format. Time constraints mean that I have not been able to deal with many other positives contained in the Bill, including its provisions safeguarding disabled access for new buildings, but they are equally important in making this Bill&rsquo;s passage into law an exciting prospect. I hope that Committee Stage of this Bill can be taken without delay. Architects are anxious to see the provisions of this Bill enacted straight away. As chairman of the committee, I will make myself available to process Committee Stage without delay and I hope the Minister can facilitate that. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the belated appearance of the Building Control Bill 2005. If I am not mistaken, it was listed on the 1997 programme for Government among all the other papers presented by the Deputies who were in Opposition at the time. In the last year of this D&aacute;il, the Government has finally got around to it. I commend my colleague, Deputy Quinn, who raised the issue of this Bill with the Taoiseach at least ten times on the Order of Business.</P><Col N="1941"/>
      <P>The Bill is based on the report, entitled Building Control: Strengthening the System, which was prepared in May 2004 by a working party of the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, the Institute of Engineers of Ireland, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors. This working group came into being owing to the clear implication that implementation of building controls had been grossly deficient since they were introduced in 1976. The group sought to bring rules, law and order to this part of the construction industry, especially in respect of the qualifications of professional people and the new energy directive on household buildings. I commend the Minister on bringing forward the Bill at long last.</P>
      <P>However, this is just too late for my constituency and for most of the Dublin region. The horse has bolted and we are stuck with what we have which is the direct result of the disgraceful behaviour that occurred on county councils throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This behaviour created the &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; developers who preyed on councillors and delivered high-rise, high-density, unplanned development on the fringes of Dublin city and county. These developments will be a disaster in the future.</P>
      <P>There is much concern in my constituency of Dublin North-East about the development of the so-called north fringe. This is a monumental development of more than 20,000 housing units which will produce an additional population of around 60,000 in my constituency alone. If we include the constituency of Dublin West and the south fringe of Dublin North, especially the massive expansion of Swords, the capacity for getting it wrong is very grave.</P>
      <P>We hear calls from all quarters for accountability, yet our leading newspapers, such as <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i>, receive a large part of their finances from auctioneering companies and developers through their massive property supplements. Last week&rsquo;s property supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> was larger than the main newspaper itself. There is also a commercial supplement on another day. Our other leading national newspaper has similar property sections. Can there be any relationship between the fact that the print media is so well funded by the current development process and the fact that we have not heard calls for the reform of the auctioneering profession, the process of planning and development, the outrageous powers of councillors to rezone land and the planning powers of county and city managers?</P>
      <P>The north fringe forum is a body which I proposed four or five years ago. It tries desperately to invigilate the massive development of our constituency. If I were a Dutch MP and we were planning the north side of Amsterdam, there would be real democratic engagement. The existing residents would have some input, along with their councillors and their MPs and we might be able to come up with a framework of develop<Col N="1942"/>ment for the expansion of the city that is acceptable to everybody. That did not happen in Dublin where an elite minority of developers behaved in a criminal fashion over the past two decades to ensure that we will be left with a high-density ring to our city with very little social infrastructure. At many meetings of the north fringe forum we find that we do not have schools, primary health care centres or hospitals nor do we have public transport facilities such as park and ride. We do not have the facilities that should be in a modern development.</P>
      <P>We can see the end result in today&rsquo;s property supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i>, where one headline reads &ldquo;Keen prices in last phase of new city quarter&rdquo;. A price of &euro;250,000 is quoted for a one bedroom apartment that measures 63 sq. m., with prices going up to &euro;410,000. Another puff piece is headlined, &ldquo;Value for first timers at the Northern Cross&rdquo;, which lists a 45 sq. m. apartment at &euro;265,000, rising to &euro;365,000. These are new apartments located in an area which has no social infrastructure. They would certainly fail the current building regulation proposals that are before us today. I am nearly certain that there are no lifts in these apartments nor access for people with disability, yet they are on the market. I also believe that the energy requirements of the new EU directive are not being fulfilled.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The key problem to this is that there is no social infrastructure in tandem with the new developments. I know that in the west side of the city there is a strategic development zone at Adamstown which is a much smaller development than that in my constituency. We should at least have such a zone in Belcamp which is located in the north fringe area. That does not currently exist and we are developing a high-rise, high-density city which is reminiscent of north Paris. We should remember the events that occurred there last year owing to the social alienation that existed. The Government is presiding over this development in the golden age of developers. That is the tragic reality. Even with the existing controls, the big problem is that part L of the building regulations is not being enforced or policed, for example, with regard to energy efficiency.</P>
      <P>The horse has bolted in the case of much of the development in my constituency, the various sections of which have been in the proposal stage since about 1999 and where, over its four major phases in Baldoyle, Donaghmede, what is now being called Belmayne and Belcamp, there is already outline or proposed permission for between 16,000 to 20,000 units. These regulations will not be any good to that area and they will not solve the difficult problems with which I and my successor public representatives for the Dublin North-East constituency will be faced. Some fundamental issues relating to public infrastructure have not been addressed. This is not just additional infrastructure but issues such as the area&rsquo;s hydrology. There has been no hydrology <Col N="1943"/>report, for example, on the two areas closest to the sea. The Government went out of its way to ensure no flood plain studies would be carried out in the Dublin or any other coastal region. All it wished to do was continue to add the apartments.</P>
      <P>As one watches the apartment boxes being lifted into place from high cranes, box after box like Lego, one wonders about the standard and quality of those apartments and what the future holds for the new residents who will pay expensive prices for them. In many cases, the developers themselves will pay for these apartments. There is a growing tendency on the part of developers to buy or hold half the street and this is something over which the Minister has no control. Young people who put their names down last September for houses in the Stapolin area of Baldoyle, which were priced at &euro;350,000, discovered a few months later when they contacted Sherry Fitzgerald auctioneers and the developer, Menollys, that all the houses at that price were being held by the builders as investors. The next cheapest house available was &euro;410,000.</P>
      <P>I disagree with my colleague&rsquo;s statement that supply and demand are equalising. The reality is that, as Deputy Gilmore said, tens of thousands of young people have given up hope of being able to afford their own house or apartment. They just cannot manage due to the constant, vicious manipulation of the system, over which this Government presides, which went from rezoning and stroking to lashing through plans and approving high density development without the social infrastructure. Ultimately, there is a golden or iron alliance of auctioneers and developers. Why is there is no control of auctioneers Bill? Where are those regulations? We will not see that under the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government because they are too closely involved with that area of society.</P>

	<P>It was not me. If one looks at the history, in most city and county councils there was an iron alliance between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael. There has been talk about the coalition Governments this country might have, but the real coalition is in local development where Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have worked hand in <Col N="1944"/>hand together. It was an iron alliance. The end result is that young people are paying through the nose for homes and many of them have given up hope of getting homes.</P>
      <P>Then there are the people who, for one reason or another, are unable to work or do not have an income or are on benefit. There are 6,000 of them on the Dublin city housing list alone. Each week we desperately try to get them some affordable units. However, with every planning permission no decision is ever taken about affordable units until long after the planning permission is given and the houses and flats are nearly ready to be occupied. That is another issue the Minister could address.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, year after year giving the figures for affordable houses. There were practically none until last year. There are approximately 3,500 this year. In fact, up to the start of last year a total of 250,000 houses were built but only 1% of them were affordable houses. That is an appalling statistic.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is a need for huge reform of how we plan and develop our future households and commercial development. With regard to the north fringe, the north fringe forum &mdash; I pay tribute to Mr. Clive Brownlee, formerly of Guinness, who is the chairperson, and the local area manager, Declan Wallace &mdash; has tried to keep tabs on this bolted horse, as it were, and is desperately, along with the other stakeholders and agencies such as the HSE, the Department of Education and Science, Beaumont Hospital and Dublin Bus, trying to get services for the area where development is proceeding at a fast rate. There must be a better way to do this. It is one of the great scandals of my time in politics that we have not been able to plan new housing in a coherent and supportive way by <Col N="1945"/>including all the additional necessary services. If I and the Minister ever meet on the central boulevard of that development in five or ten years time, I hope we will not regret not taking proper responsibility for the area at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the comments Deputy Haughey made about the fire safety regulations. Today&rsquo;s newspaper shows that, at long last, the services appear to be responding more vigorously. The newspaper reports that a proprietor was prosecuted for locking doors of the premises during a function. Given the incredible carnage at the Stardust 25 years ago, it is appropriate that this should occur. I hope the full inquiry everybody is seeking will take place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Part 2 initiatives in the Bill, particularly the fire safety certificates, the regularisation certificates, the disability access certificate for part M and the move towards summary prosecution in the District Court. These are basic requirements to ensure that new buildings will meet a fundamental standard. As I stated, our concern is that recent buildings do not meet this standard. Section 6 contains a provision for appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la with regard to disability access certificates and fire safety certificates. Why is this the case? Why do we need this type of appeal? Given the importance of access and protection from fire disasters, why should the local control authority not be in a position to simply implement its enforcement, and leave it at that?</P>
      <P>I welcome the legal transposition of Directive 2002/91/EC of 16 December and the implications this has with regard to energy performance ratings for new housing stock and will have for such ratings for older housing stock from 1 January 2009. Until recently, many households had appalling energy efficiency standards. Very often, the lower the household income, the less well it was insulated and heated. I welcome the fact that Energy Action Ireland, through Government funding, is providing insulation for free to senior citizens. I commend the Minister for this initiative and hope it will be extended.</P>
      <P>My party, of which I am energy spokesperson, believes that householders and individuals have a grave responsibility for their own energy footprint and carbon dioxide emissions. The implementation of the directive through this legislation will be an important step in encouraging people to take responsibility for their own and their households&rsquo; carbon footprint. I welcome the measure and hope it will be vigorously implemented.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister. I hope it will be the first of a series of Bills which will in the coming years try to avoid the mistakes that have happened and are happening in vast areas of our cities and towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I reassure Deputy Broughan that the person who has been most vocal in seeking regulation of the estate agency profession, <Col N="1946"/>with the possible exception of Senator Ross, is the Minister, Deputy McDowell. I look forward to reminding Deputy Broughan of his words before the end of this D&aacute;il. I have no doubt the Minister is keen to have this issue addressed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, which provides for measures regarding disability access and fire safety, although it is tardy when one considers we are implementing legislation 25 years after the Stardust disaster, which is not a matter of which we can be proud. The Bill also deals with the regulation of professions. However, a most important element of the Bill is that it transposes into Irish law the EU directive on the energy performance of buildings. It is largely to this aspect that I will address my comments.</P>
      <P>The energy rating directive is concerned with pollution. The issues of energy, security of supply, our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol and carbon dioxide emissions have moved centre stage as important international geopolitical issues. We find ourselves at the end of a line in terms of supply. Security of supply is a key element, the other being the consumption of energy. The Bill and the directive address the issue of conservation.</P>
      <P>As was stated, the heating and cooling of buildings accounts for roughly 45% of energy consumption and results in the corresponding generation of carbon dioxide. Given that the performance of buildings accounts for such a high proportion of consumption, it is important that we institute policies which will seek to get the best performance possible from buildings. Apart from the energy supply needed to heat and cool buildings, we must factor in the additional costs of the carbon dioxide produced as a result. It is an issue we must take seriously.</P>
      <P>It is important that we are finally transposing the directive into Irish law. Some have claimed it will result in higher house prices, which is not the case. It is in the long-term interests of householders to have their buildings perform efficiently. We need to encourage and inform householders in this regard.</P>
      <P>I appeared on a television programme earlier this week to speak on this matter. It was brought to my attention that the directive will come into law but nobody will know about it, which highlights a problem with the D&aacute;il. It is seen by Members as a glass house and we think that because we are discussing an issue, everybody else is also discussing it. They are not.</P>
      <P>We must follow up this issue when the directive is transposed into Irish law. Funding should be made available for an intensive advertising and information campaign to explain it to the public. It is in the long-term interests of householders to have their buildings perform to the highest standards. We have an obligation to inform house<Col N="1947"/>holders and provide incentives, although I accept that many incentives are currently available. I am a great believer in the carrot rather than the stick. Whether the aim is to encourage people to insulate their attics more efficiently or otherwise, we must try to reduce the national consumption of energy and we must incentivise people to achieve this.</P>
      <P>The briefing material suggests carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced by 22% through efficiencies. This represents a huge bill, with which we will be faced if we do not act. We have signed up to the Kyoto Protocol and we need to be conscious of the consequences of this. We can show we are serious about the protocol by tackling issues which will reduce carbon dioxide levels. The proportion of emissions resulting from housing is greater than that from the transport sector, so we need to get our act together.</P>
      <P>Some 70% of housing stock has been built in the past ten years &mdash; the Minister may correct me if that figure is wrong. People are now more aware of the energy performance of buildings, largely due to the significant recent increases in the price of gas and oil, and they realise that their homes need better insulation. However, I regret that we are brought to this point kicking and screaming and that we always do the minimum. We should try to introduce provisions which would take from models of best practice, such as Sweden. I accept Sweden has a colder climate but we must look to best practice and try to emulate it.</P>
      <P>The owners of the 70% of houses which are under ten years old could have been provided with much more efficient heating systems had we introduced maximal insulation regulations and construction standards. We owe this to householders who are facing huge bills. Most would agree that oil and gas prices are only going one way, namely, up. We need to face this reality. If we do, it might cost a little more to build a house or invest. I heard it would cost an additional &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000 to build a one-off house to the highest energy efficiency standard. While it is not everybody who can afford that extra money, how long would it take to get that amount back? We need to give people an incentive. A constituent told me of an energy efficiency grant available to a developer building ten units. However, such builders will not necessarily embrace the higher standards as they try to keep costs to a minimum to maximise their profits or to reduce the price to the buyer. We also need to incentivise building one-off houses in the most energy efficient way. We should reconsider the matter and amend the proposal to encourage those building their own homes to do so in the most energy efficient way. It has been indicated that a house built to the highest standards would give the household an annual saving of approximately &euro;1,000. It would not take long for the investment to be returned.</P><Col N="1948"/>
      <P>We also need to be very conscious of building management. In addition to heating of buildings, cooling is becoming more common. I heard that an audit was carried out to determine the efficiency of the heating in the Dublin City Council building on Wood Quay. It found that the building is heated and lit for 54% of the time that it is unoccupied, which is quite extraordinary. I heard that, unfortunately, the person responsible did not particularly mind that this was the case. I was horrified to hear that he did not care as long as the lights and heating came on on Monday morning when the employees arrived. Whatever about the lights, heating a building for 54% of the time when it is unoccupied represents an enormous waste of money for the local authority. In addition it produces CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
      <P>We need to clamp down and make people think about how they are adding to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, as it will cost us a considerable amount. As most Members will know, when the carbon tax issue was first discussed, it was thought that we might need to pay &euro;10 per tonne. However, it is now at approximately &euro;23 to &euro;25 per tonne and probably increasing. People are insufficiently aware of inefficiencies and their costs. I was in Government Buildings during the week. When I came down the main staircase I was overwhelmed by the heat. Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, runs a campaign in the depths of winter encouraging us all to turn down our thermostats by 1&deg; in order to reduce our bills by 10%. I would recommend that the heating in the vicinity of the main staircase close to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office be turned down, as it is extremely hot there. We need to lead by example.</P>
      <P>All public buildings should meet the highest energy efficiency requirements and not just minimum standards. At the design stage we need to consider how a building is located to maximise the use of natural light etc. We are certainly getting better. We have a very high standard particularly in civic offices throughout the country. We have wonderful examples of modern architecture. I hope as much attention is being paid to the energy efficiency of these buildings. The town hall in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is the jewel in the crown of the town. That is a fine 19th century building. The civic offices in Birr, County Offaly, are beautiful and are a wonderful example of a 21st century building. We should spend money on building civic offices to the highest architectural standards. While I have not been there, the civic building in Swords looks beautiful. I hope energy efficiency is considered when they are built.</P>
      <P>When introducing legislation we need to ensure it will be well policed. It is in the long-term interest not just of the country in terms of reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and the cost of importing fossil fuels but also of the public to police these standards. We need to have enough inspectors who need to be familiar with the building standards and the new standards of energy rating to be confident that the directive will work. One <Col N="1949"/>speaker asked whether the legislation was just paying lip service. We must ensure that enforcement is a key element in the Bill. When considering buildings that might not have been built to the highest energy efficiency standard, we need to recognise that the cost of doing something right is much less than the expense of trying to remedy it after it has broken down.</P>
      <P>The Bill in transposing the energy performance directive has pollution in mind and we should all welcome it. I look forward to better building standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill. I agree with having lifetime adaptable housing to which we should all aspire. When we are born, we do not know what might happen in the future and how our lives might change. God forbid that we might become disabled, but it can happen. Our housing should be as people friendly as possible. The system should serve the people and not the other way around. Too often that emphasis is lost and the Bill may help in that regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Part M was included to make a difference and allow premises to be accessible. However, there are growth limitations and I understand the Minister is reviewing part M, which is to be welcomed. The difficulty is that while a house may be accessible, getting to that house may not be possible, which defeats the purpose of part M. It may be that the extent of it is to ensure that toilets are accessible to disabled people. While major improvements are required in part M, it represents a step towards lifetime adaptable housing which should be our goal.</P>
      <P>While we do not know whether we might become disabled, we know we will get older. We hope we will have long lives, which often means increasing disability and thereby not being able to use a house that is not disabled-friendly. We should aim towards equality for everyone rather than catering for a disability. We should aim to ensure that everyone, right across the board, has the same ability to access a house or building. We know well that surveys conducted show disgraceful access to premises, particularly public buildings. There is 4% access to housing developments under construction, a disgraceful figure that must be improved.</P>
      <P>One must know who one is dealing with if it is a professional person. If someone is an architect, one should be able to trust him or her to do the job. That is very important, no matter what walk of life one is in. In building especially, many people purport to be architects, and people must know exactly who they are dealing with.</P><Col N="1950"/>
      <P>Energy conservation is logical and should be backed to a greater degree by Government grants to ensure access to the best materials, thereby cutting people&rsquo;s energy use and bringing us into line with what we should be doing as good Europeans, if not as people who have an obligation to protect the earth for the next generation and ensure we do not waste finite fossil resources.</P>
      <P>There are problems with planning, and in the context of this Bill, I would like to mention one or two. While there are guidelines for planning in local authorities, there is no real easing in terms of people being able to live in rural areas. I come from a rural area and this is dear to my heart. I see the importance of infrastructure and housing, the most important element of infrastructure. If one cannot live in an area, there will be no further development there. There must be provision to build a house in a rural area, with services for it. If there are houses, there are people, and if there are people, there is a need for services. That helps the regeneration of rural areas, but when one has a policy directing people towards the largest centres of population, as currently, it can only lead to continuing depopulation elsewhere. The Minister should re-examine interpretation of the planning guidelines by local authorities. There are some very fine people working as planners for the local authorities and they are under much pressure. Many non-nationals are now working in the area. I sometimes wonder, however, whether they have the expertise and understanding to deal with the rural planning issues that face them daily.</P>
      <P>Another point relates to vexatious objectors and it must be examined. I have had personal experience, having unfortunately been involved at a community level with such people. In one situation, I was trying to arrange an extension at St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village in Mulranny, but the whole process was scuppered by people who could write in without giving a name or address and hold up the entire process. They were able to produce a list of objections that would have to be gone through and teased out. There is an onus on the Government to consider that situation, since people should not have the right to frustrate community projects in that way.</P>
      <P>That it is happening all over the place. I had to engage the services of a private detective to try to find out what exactly was happening there. I discovered the person supposed to have given the letter of objection to the local authority did not even exist. The block of flats where the person was supposed to be living was one where a great many non-nationals were accommodated, and after extensive inquiries it was found that no such person existed. It was an attempt to frustrate the planning process. Although I got the garda&iacute; to investigate further for me to check that no such person existed, the only thing worrying the local authority was whether it would have somewhere to send the notices regarding what was happening in the planning process.</P><Col N="1951"/>
      <P>The Minister must examine this matter, which I have raised before, although I was not at all happy with the response. The Minister must reconsider the situation and perhaps formulate some form of sanction against persons who try to frustrate the planning process in that way. An Bord Plean&aacute;la has an important onus to do the right thing and act independently. While I do not doubt the integrity of its staff, I wonder about the lack of representation from the community.</P>
      <P>The Irish Rural Development Association was established in response to difficulties with planning in rural areas. I am not in favour of a free-for-all in planning, since there should be some restrictions. However, there must be fair play and an obligation on the Government to ensure the people who live in an area, whom this is all about, should be allowed to remain there if at all possible, just as their families did for generations before them.</P>
      <P>I will give an example of a decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la where its own inspectors were over-ruled. If that happens, the board has an obligation to provide a detailed analysis of its reasoning. In the Ringaskiddy incinerator case, there were written objections from 20,000 people, and despite the decision by Cork County Council not to carry out the necessary rezoning, An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruled in favour of the development, even over-ruling its own inspectors&rsquo; findings. That was strange indeed, and where it takes place, An Bord Plean&aacute;la should spell out why it is doing so.</P>
      <P>One must understand that this is about people. Michael Mohan said that the concept of inclusive design was linked to a universal right of access. The excellent book <i>Building for Everyone</i> by the National Disability Authority stated that the user was at the centre of the issuing process rather than the building or designer, an approach whereby accessibility, central to the process from the outset, can become invisible, properly integrated into the general building design. It concludes that the aim of inclusive design, sometimes called universal design, should be to make it a seamless part of the design process so everyone can participate equally.</P>
      <P>It is about equal access rather than disabled access, so we move away from the negativity that accompanies disability. If we move towards equal access and promote ability rather than disability, we will be on the right road. We must not forget that people are in the centre of this equation and must be served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Building Control Bill 2005.</P>
      <P>This discussion is both very important and very relevant to the times in which we live. We talk about development, planning apartments, and densities in urban areas in particular. Before I go into the details, we should seriously examine the role of developers, pointing out to them that they <Col N="1952"/>have duties and responsibilities. They also have a strong duty and responsibility to ensure estates are finished properly. I have been extremely critical of certain developers who have not delivered to the customers who bought their homes. I demand that they finish estates and install the proper infrastructure before they exit. There are also developers who have shown good practice, and I do not wish to exclude them.</P>
      <P>Just as developers and builders have a responsibility regarding this legislation, so too do Ministers, Members of the Oireachtas and councillors.</P>
      <P>It is a little rich, totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable to have lobbyists and people with bundles of cash knocking on politicians&rsquo; doors in the middle of the night. Similarly, it is unacceptable to have a politician claiming not to have looked into an envelope and consequently being unaware as to whether it contained &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000. This is not good enough and must be challenged effectively during this debate. Sleaze and corruption in politics must be rooted out and cannot be tolerated. Apart from politicians, allegations have been made with regard to corruption among officials in different sections of various councils throughout the State and this matter should also be properly investigated. Both officials and politicians have been severely damaged.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>As I noted, some developers have done great work. While I welcome the fact that developers make money, it should not be at the expense of taxpayers or young home buyers. If they have extra cash, they should donate it to charities or to worthwhile projects. Some already do so. Politicians must face up to their responsibilities and cannot turn a blind eye. Failure to co-operate with the Garda in this respect is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for a politician not to respond to a letter from the Garda in respect of any allegations of corruption in their council area. One should not remain silent or fail to respond because one does not believe the query to be relevant. Members and political party leaders should note there is no point in throwing stones at the Government parties if they themselves are directly or indirectly involved in such matters. I will not accept this and the Independent Members will stand by the taxpayers and the citizens and will stand up for the people in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>These activities took place in the past and that reality must be faced. Turning a blind eye to corruption and sleaze should never be an option in public life. People seek honesty, decency and fair play in politics.</P>
      <P>On the subject of planning and development, I wish to discuss the tragic situation in my constituency, where recently the Silver Swan public house <Col N="1953"/>on Kilmore Road, Artane was reopened. This was the site of the tragic Stardust disaster in 1981, in which 48 people died, 241 people were seriously injured and hundreds of families were severely damaged. Despite this, a businessman had the brass neck to open a public house on the site on the 25th anniversary of the fire. This is unacceptable to people of the northside of Dublin and it will not be tolerated. I commend the families and protesters. I have been on the picket line myself for many nights in their support.</P>
      <P>I wish to take the opportunity to ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, to encourage the Cabinet to reopen the investigation into the Stardust fire tragedy. People have the right to truth and justice. They have submitted new forensic evidence on the issue of the Stardust&rsquo;s fire doors which should be examined. These are serious allegations which have never been faced properly. When one discusses planning and development for the future, these are also important elements. If that businessman possessed any courage, he would have provided a proper facility for young people in memory of the 48 victims on the site, rather than a public house. A major protest will be held in Drumcondra next Saturday at 10 a.m. I encourage all Members to attend.</P>
      <P>When the issue of public money is being dealt with in the context of planning and development, it is important to recall and seriously question the amount of wasted public money in respect of the building and construction of major infrastructural projects. For example, my constituency contains the Dublin Port tunnel project. Some 240 houses have been severely damaged with cracked walls and kitchens, or subsidence in their gardens or extensions. However, the Government parties, as well as some of the major Opposition parties, are silent on this issue. It is unacceptable for the residents of Marino, Santry and Fairview to be treated in this fashion. I will stand up for them inside and outside the House as they demand their rights and seek support for the damage to their homes. Before the project commenced, they were told that nothing would happen. In reality, there is a major issue in respect of damage to homes, as well as floods and leaks. While people have appeared on television to assert that the residents are being alarmist, the water buckets are down underneath Marino, Fairview and Santry. I challenge people in respect of this issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Moreover, the project has run &euro;200 million over budget and some predict this figure will rise to &euro;400 million. I raise these issues because they are important and because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has spent &euro;30 million for a farm in north County Dublin which is valued by most sensible people at approximately &euro;4 million. This kind of wastage of taxpayers&rsquo; money is unacceptable and should be challenged. This money could have been used to end the scandal of patients on trolleys forever. <Col N="1954"/>Alternatively, the Government could have built all the new schools it needed, or could have made a major dent in the housing lists, or could have developed child care services. Above all, it could have assisted the elderly.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is an important point. The Bill provides for the strengthening of the enforcement powers of local building control authorities. On foot of the recommendations made by the buildings regulations advisory body, the Bill introduces revised procedures for issue of fire safety certificates by local building control authorities to confirm compliance with part B &mdash; fire safety &mdash; of the building regulations for designs of new non-domestic buildings, that is, offices, factories, shops, hotels and new apartment blocks.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill also introduces a disability access certificate to confirm that the design of new non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks complies with part M of the building regulations, that is, access for people with disabilities. I wish to highlight the rights of people with disabilities. Developers and planners have a duty to ensure the rights of tens of thousands of people with disabilities are protected. They have the right of access to buildings and it is not good enough to build apartment blocks or public buildings without respecting people with disabilities. I commend the disability groups, particularly those who for the past ten years have been directly involved in promoting the rights of people with disabilities to services and proper access to buildings. After all the talk, more than 3,000 families remain on residential respite and day care waiting lists. This is the reality for families who must cope with intellectual disabilities and is an important aspect of this debate. The section of the Bill which deals with disability access certificates should highlight the need to strongly support people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>An action plan for Richmond Road is under development at present and I welcome Dublin City Council&rsquo;s input to the plan. However, it has a duty, before any further development commences on Richmond Road, to ensure the infrastructure to cater for new developments and residents is put in place. This includes upgrading the drainage, especially flood and foulwater, provisions. Considerable upgrading of the road infrastructure, including Grace Park Road, is required, along with provision for pedestrian, bus and cycle traffic. There should be consultations with Dublin Bus regarding the requirement to provide a bus service for Richmond Road and the large new apartment blocks and housing estates. The number of new traffic lights should be restricted by ensuring all the new developments feed into the main road appropriately. There should also be adequate street furniture and lighting as well as an upgrade of the freshwater supply.</P>
      <P>I support the residents of Richmond Road, who should also be protected by the Garda. Recent incidents after a match between Shel<Col N="1955"/>bourne and Glentoran in which residents had their windows smashed also constitute a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I will highlight these issues in the residents&rsquo; interests. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this legislation. Developers have responsibilities and citizens have rights and I urge Members to listen to this argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Finian McGrath is not alone in his concern that we should have the highest standards on the part of both politicians and officials in respect of the administration of local authorities and Government. I have been pleased by the volume of legislation which has been introduced since 1997, which will keep all Members on the straight and narrow. It ensures the transparency of the reporting mechanisms operated by individual public representatives and offers accountability to the highest level. Despite the numbers of cases which have been reported recently in the public media concerning officials and politicians, it cannot be forgotten that the great bulk of politicians and officials serving at national or local level perform their duties beyond reproach. This point must be stated as frequently as possible because since my election in 1997, I have heard numerous debates in this House which centred on the corruption of a small number of officials and politicians who took money for one reason or another. Most Members enter public life to do their best. While Deputy McGrath is correct up to a point, the other side of the argument must also be pointed out and taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill introduced by the Minister, Deputy Roche. For me, the most important part of it is perhaps that which refers to the control of those qualified as architects, building surveyors and quantity surveyors and ensures that all involved in those professions are suitably qualified for the work they are undertaking, that there is a register kept of those qualified to which people can refer and that all those involved in those professions are expected to keep up certain standards in their work with either developers or individual members of the public. Most of the issues of which we speak in the context of this debate start with and can be controlled by that block of people who engage with individuals and developers and who provide the professional advice to make a planning application in the first place.</P>
      <P>I have seen far too often where developers purchase a large tract of land for an enormous price and thereafter must ensure that the highest number of units are put on that site in order that they might get a profit from it. Deputy McGrath also referred to this. That is what the profit line is driven by. I understand that the developers must <Col N="1956"/>make money, but the need to make back the type of foolish money invested in sites is causing a problem within the planning section because after the purchase they press for permission for the greatest number of housing units, apartments or commercial units. That practice must stop. Developers must adopt a commonsense approach to the purchase price of land and to the planning permission available subsequently.</P>
      <P>In my city of Kilkenny I have seen in-fill sites, for example, being purchased at outrageous prices. For that price the developer then must get four houses instead of two. If it is properly stated within the county development plan and if the architects and the surveyors appointed by the developer properly state prior to purchase what can be achieved on a site, then there will not be the rush to the maximum limit and beyond which is seen currently within the planning process. Part of controlling that, without being mentioned in this Bill, is set down in the context of how we treat the architects, surveyors and quantity surveyors. It is good that we are doing that in the context of legislation.</P>
      <P>Alongside and parallel to that there should be a system whereby within the Department every planner is not only informed of this legislation but extends it to the point I mentioned earlier, that prior to a purchase where a pre-planning query is made, the person or company making the inquiry is brought in to hear the various restrictions on the site explained, not only in the context of legislation and the county development plan but also in the context of general sensible development that can take place on that site. All that planning has an impact on what is achieved on the site and the consumer. I am glad that this legislation has a serious focus on the consumer in question and makes a serious effort to protect the rights of future consumers in the context of any development taking place.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that a proactive role needs to be taken in this by county managers and the engineers employed in local authorities. That can be achieved by consultation with the Departments to ensure that a common line is followed in every county. One of the other issues is that there is no consistency between counties, that is, greater density is achieved on specific sites in different counties and that leads to confusion. Setting it out in the context of this Bill is therefore a good idea.</P>
      <P>The Bill&rsquo;s other focus is on the disability groups. Given that approximately 80,000 units are being built a year, it is very important as the economy develops and improves with greater turnover and people having greater aspirations and expectations that we focus on the area of disability and ensure in the context of good planning that every aspect of the Bill is adhered to. This leads back to the architects and surveyors. Too often over recent years I have seen lip-service paid to the legislation and the planning regulations on access for those with a disability to public buildings or <Col N="1957"/>general housing. The Bill sets down a certification process for those who make planning applications. I want to see that certification process streamlined, efficient and achieving what is set out in the Bill on behalf of the consumer.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As we move along in this process of developing the country and providing all these housing units, commercial operations and civic buildings such as administrative centres in the various growing centres of population, this certification process must ensure that there is not only public access for those with a disability to toilet facilities, etc. but that we really extend the process to make working buildings for everyone. The critical judgment call I would make on any building is whether there is access for everyone. There is such access in some of our civic buildings. There are lifts and ramps and people can access every part of the building to do their business. In older buildings, however, there is not such access. In a city such as Kilkenny where there are many old buildings which cannot be tampered with due to their heritage value, there are also those used as civic buildings such as City Hall which a person with a disability cannot enter because it contains stairs from top to bottom and there is no lift.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As this Bill is being introduced by the Department with responsibility for heritage and local government, there is a need to ensure that we lead by example and that a much greater effort is made to ensure that those with a disability can access those older buildings. That means spending a considerable amount of money on slowly but surely going through that list of buildings and ensuring accessibility for all. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, apart from this Bill but in the context of the work of the Department, would encourage county managers to get to grips with the problems in such old buildings. For instance, in Kilkenny Borough Council one of the members of the council cannot access the building and sometimes the meeting must be held elsewhere. That is unforgivable, given that the issue of access has been debated over the years. It always comes down to funding and in the context of this Bill, we must lead and show good example. Showing good example will cost money but it will pay off in the end.</P>
      <P>Similarly, where the owner of a commercial building, regardless of whether it is leased to a company, shows an intent to make it accessible, there should be grants available. We cannot simply set down legislation and correct it as we go along. We must revise what is in place. It would be no harm if the State were to provide a financial incentive to people who own such buildings to do the job of providing lifts, ramps, wider doorways etc. That needs to be done sooner rather than later. It will pay off in the context of accessibility to services and employment. People with disabilities who could not take up certain jobs previously because of the lack of access to buildings will be able to do so following the enactment of the legislation.</P><Col N="1958"/>
      <P>The granting of planning permission has become a major issue in the enforcement of building control. My experience with Kilkenny County Council has been positive because it has an enforcement section. One can have a complaint processed to ensure a building is constructed in accordance with the planning permission. These sections are hugely important in the context of this legislation. The Minister of State said he intends to speak to county managers to ensure their building enforcement sections are alive and well and take a proactive approach in ensuring planning conditions and provisions in this legislation are met so that buildings are in compliance with planning permission.</P>
      <P Just="Left">That will create a need for additional local authority staff if the Minister is serious about implementing the legislation. Will the Minister of State examine the issue of joined up Government and relate it to joined up agencies? Health and Safety Authority staff undertake site inspections while staff in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and Revenue also inspect building sites for other reasons. Their efforts should be combined to police the building regulation process. I encourage the Minister of State to examine the possibility of using this multi-skilled cohort of staff to undertake this work, which would eliminate the need to recruit additional employees to enforcement sections that need to investigate building sites. The behaviour of a number of developers and builders towards employees by neglecting or ignoring their rights has been at the centre of public discourse in recent weeks. A multi-agency approach to resolving this problem should be considered.</P>
      <P>I refer to fire certification. The fire service needs additional staff to cope with the number of buildings that need to be certified, given the increased development taking place in every county. When fire certificates are approved, sufficient staff should be available to ensure there is no delay in issuing them. Under the legislation, a developer will have to secure a certificate that reflects the provision of access for people with disabilities and a fire certificate to comply with planning permission. This will increase the public scrutiny of planning applications and provide opportunities for appeals and so on. The process should be transparent and open to the public while achieving efficiency in the granting of certificates and complying with planning permission within the specified period. Deadlines need to be specified for both making applications for certificates and the approval of such certificates.</P>
      <P>A major onus will be placed on the fire service. Its core task is to deal with fires, accidents and so on in the community. There are major gaps in the fire service infrastructure and investment is needed in staff, vehicles and buildings. Fire stations also have access difficulties. As communities develop and new standards and regulations are enforced, the Department must lead by example and ensure the fire service can <Col N="1959"/>adequately deal with the safety issues for which it is responsible. The service should have the infrastructure and resources it needs, including funding, to ensure it can do its job. I commend the men and women of the fire service, who work more than the normal number of hours to ensure a fast and efficient service is delivered to the local communities. However, they work against a backdrop of the construction of 80,000 additional housing units, the extension and relocation of many commercial buildings and the expansion of centres of population. Commercial premises are relocating to county towns and so on where they would not have set up in the past and the fire service is trying to catching up with this development. The fire service is offering new services in towns such as Freshford and Castlecomer in my county but there are gaps in other urban centres such as Graiguenamanagh, Thomastown and so on.</P>
      <P>We must focus on what is expected from the service. The Bill will be implemented by local government, which we are told is seriously under pressure, and the fire service, which is also under pressure. The Minister of State must acknowledge this and make the appropriate changes, where necessary, and the Government should be prepared to increase investment in the system. I am pleased energy efficiency in new homes is covered in the legislation. Developers and others will be encouraged to look beyond oil fired central heating and consider other heating concepts so that people will not be affected by the price of oil. Developers should be encouraged to take on new concepts when building new homes and commercial premises larger than 10,800 sq. ft. That is a positive development. Our approach should be environmentally friendly. I look forward to the debate on the finer points of the Bill on later Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Opposition usually highlights what is missing. However, I welcome a number of provisions in the legislation, including the proposed increased powers for local authorities to enforce planning requirements on access to buildings. We have failed on this issue. Many years ago legislation was introduced which stated access to buildings should be provided at the front for people with disabilities. However, most buildings did not comply with this and access was provided through a side entrance or through the back. That is the same as saying to somebody with a disability that he or she must enter through the back door because the ramp does not look good at the front of the building. Although it was right to introduce the legislation, it has not been enforced properly and we have let ourselves down in this regard.</P>
      <P>This often happens with our legislation. Across the board local authority planning is an area where we have failed to come to grips with the <Col N="1960"/>actions that should follow on from good legislation. I welcome the fact that this Bill probably gives us more powers to enforce the legislation properly in this area. It is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change in the limits on who can use the terms &ldquo;architect&rdquo;, &ldquo;building surveyor&rdquo; or &ldquo;quantity surveyor&rdquo; and that professionals will now have this status and be named on a national register. This is important. Many people work in this area and charge people large amounts of money to design houses, draw plans, etc. I question the ability of some of these and wonder what education they have and what courses they have completed. I would go further than the Bill. Apart from having to display their qualifications, they should have to show a portfolio of their previous work. There should also be more of a link between professionals and councils at local level.</P>
      <P>Councils and professionals need a greater understanding of each other&rsquo;s business. When new laws on planning and building controls are introduced, some professionals fall behind. For example, in January new regulations required planning applications to include a contour study, but most planning applications continued to arrive without it. We seem to miss out on simple issues such as this. Who ends up paying for these failures? The customer ends up paying when the architect must resubmit everything and advertise the application again in the newspaper. I suggest there should be more interaction between the different professionals doing jobs for customers and the councils.</P>
      <P>Sometimes council staff and staff in planning offices are not well informed on the regulations and changes in them. They may only get one copy of the new rules rather than a copy for everybody. I have visited planning offices &mdash; not in my county &mdash; where only one copy of the planning regulations came for free from the Government and any further copies had to be paid for. We still expect them to enforce the regulations. What is the logic in this? We should do it properly and equip councils and staff to enforce the legislation.</P>
      <P>Apart from legislating to provide councils with the powers to enforce regulations, we must consider providing finance. We have slipped up in this area, especially in areas with the pressure of high development, mainly in the greater Dublin region and other cities and large towns. We have not properly resourced planning departments either by providing sufficient staff for good planning or for checking building control procedures. We need staff to check if conditions are complied with and that buildings are constructed as they should be.</P>
      <P>Some improvements have been made in staffing. However, it is hard for local authorities to get sufficient funds to be really in control. Without good staff who know their job and have time to do it, we will not have proper building controls and the local authority will not be in authority. In most cases the developers will have the power <Col N="1961"/>and they will laugh at the councils because they do not have authority. We must staff councils properly and equip them with the knowledge and training they need to have proper standing and building controls. While this Bill is wide-ranging, it touches on just a few of these areas.</P>
      <P>I have a major concern where conditions of planning are not enforced. We should not accept this situation nor should it be allowed. Every developer should be made carry out the conditions of planning without excuse. We accept they may want to change the conditions for certain reasons, but let them make another application to do so properly and let them inform the residents of the association or estate of the changes they intend to make. The public are the people who lose out when changes are made. They end up suffering because of the lack of control or the lack of powers.</P>
      <P>Another concern of mine is the record of builders and developers. Under the Planning and Development Act councils can refuse developers permission based on their record or on whether they have done a bad job previously or been associated with a company that has been involved in a bad development. However, they can only refuse them on these grounds by first going to the High Court. We know how much that costs and that is the problem. Local authorities will not run the risk of going to the High Court.</P>
      <P>I welcome, therefore, some of the changes in this Bill relating to building controls for smaller developments and the possibility of going to different courts. Councils will not run the risk of high costs. Planning law is a grey area and if a council takes a developer to the High Court, it is likely the council will lose the case and be down a few hundred thousand euro. That leaves less money for footpaths, lighting and facilities for young people in towns. Councils rarely run that risk. Therefore, developers know their past record will not be taken into consideration and just laugh it off. They continue to do things wrong, knowing they will get away with doing so. There are some good developers but there are also many chancers who do not do a good job. We have not taken control of the situation and stamped out this bad practice.</P>
      <P>The main problem with the lack of building control is finishing off estates. A person building a one-off house cannot afford to be cheeky with the council or to take any risks. These people face the full rigour of the law and the council comes down on them if they step sideways or build on an extra room. The big developers, on the other hand, who know the game well and have the staff and can afford to take on the council get away with bloody murder on a regular basis. They leave estates half-finished without footpaths, lighting or a second layer of tarmac. They know they will get away with it and do not care. It is a shame we do not stamp this out and insist the council is in charge and must be respected. That <Col N="1962"/>is what we should do. If we did this, it would save us money and hardship in the long run.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the Bill to provide for building control inspectors who will oversee the quality of work on housing at the various stages of building. In other jurisdictions each level of development is checked and overseen before the council signs off on it to ensure the quality of the houses being built. I have been in many houses built during the boom of the past five or six years that would not be passed. Local authorities do not even pass them when it comes to buying them under shared ownership schemes, thankfully. Why do they allow them be built? It is because councils were not given the staff or finance to check them and control the development. Unfortunately, many people have bought houses that are not up to the quality they should be. We will have major problems as a result in the coming years.</P>
      <P>We are familiar as local and national politicians with the problems faced by estates where sewerage and water systems have not been installed correctly. This is because of bad workmanship and a lack of adequate supervision. My local authority has included a charge on each development to try to ensure there is some money to pay for a surveyor or someone to check the work. We should not have to do that and I am not sure it is within our rights. It is our attempt to control what is being built and to end the bad work being done.</P>
      <P>In some cases digital images of developments have been submitted that did not relate to the development to imply that everything was all right and sewage pipes were clear, etc. What goes on in the industry is a disgrace. Why does it happen? It happens because people want to take shortcuts and make larger profits, people who have not been properly trained do the work and, most importantly, people know they will get away with it because we do not have proper controls.</P>
      <P>We have had some improvements but much damage has been done. The message must go out that we will not accept bad workmanship. On behalf of the people who buy these houses, we must ensure they are built properly.</P>
      <P>We have a concern about the phasing of works on developments. People end up living in houses on what is still a building site without lighting or footpaths. We need a change in this regard so that developments are constructed in an orderly fashion. I welcome the introduction of local area plans and strategic development zones, SDZs. These are a good way of carrying out developments because they bring order and organisation. However, there are still too many one-off applications for estates that do not blend in well in their area.</P>
      <P>A major problem is finishing off estates, especially electricity connections. The ESB, the developer and the council are involved but no one takes charge of it. We have residents&rsquo; associations fighting for three years to get their lights <Col N="1963"/>turned on. These are lights that are in place and if a button was pressed, they could be on. However, because of procedures and rules that have not been changed in modern times to speed things up, the residents sit in darkness, night after night. We all know how dangerous it can be to walk around a building site or housing estate without lights. We must find ways of speeding things up and sorting them out. Someone must take control and get things done so the issues are resolved.</P>
      <P>The purpose of building control is to make people afraid of the authority and let them know who is the boss. It is designed to ensure builders do things correctly in the first place and have proper discussions on each development. I am speaking specifically about housing estates and the development of new areas.</P>
      <P>I favour a formal procedure, although I know it can happen informally in some areas, whereby every planning application for over a set number of houses in towns and villages would be brought before a meeting of the area council. That meeting would be attended by all those involved, including the engineers, planners, the manager of the area, the person involved in community facilities and some of the councillors, who would discuss the impact of the estate on the village or town. They could examine whether new footpaths are needed to allow residents get to town and who will pay for them, whether a new school is needed, and so forth. Builders have to provide cr&egrave;che facilities for every 70 houses, but perhaps a new community centre would also be needed. It is important to look at the overall picture and the impact of adding a new estate to an area. Ideally, that should be done at zoning stage, but it is not always done then. In some cases, the rezoning has been done already. A discussion should take place on who will pay for everything and if that means requesting more time to deal with the application, so be it. The application should not be pushed through just because the two-month timeframe is up.</P>
      <P>I have a major issue with the bonds given by developers to councils. They are always too low and as time passes, their value diminishes. If an application is granted in 2000 but the development is not built until 2005, a bond of &euro;20,000 is not sufficient. At that stage, &euro;20,000 is the profit on one house for a developer, who may think to hell with it and move on. He or she will not spend time finishing the work to get the bond back. If the bond really hurt developers, financially or in some other way, it could make a difference. Developers would then finish the job correctly and complete an estate in order to get it back. I ask the Department to examine the option of ensuring the bond reflects the price of the houses in an estate or that the last five houses cannot be sold until the estate is completely finished. That would mean the bond would be relevant. At least then if a developer did not build the houses for ten years, the value of the bond would have <Col N="1964"/>increased accordingly, rather than being an historical cost which does not bother him or her. Small changes could help greatly in terms of building control and stamping out faults.</P>
      <P>Effective building control and follow-up legislation rests on money and proper funding but our local authorities are not being properly funded. Some are lucky enough to have a high rates base, with numerous companies and industries in their areas. To take my county of Meath, its rates base has been &euro;11 million or &euro;12 million for the last number of years. This year, with some changes, it will be lucky to take in approximately &euro;16 million. The council next door, Fingal County Council, gets approximately &euro;100 million in rates, which is a massive difference. This is the money used by councils to provide services to people. In growing counties like Meath, Kildare and Louth, money is not available to match the increases in population and to allow the local authorities to provide services like building, planning and environmental control as well as basic facilities to allow people to get on with their everyday lives.</P>
      <P>We have been saying this for a long time, as former local authority members and as Deputies. The proof is now on paper in the form of the report from Farrell Grant Sparks which shows the funding provided to Meath County Council is only 70% of the national average. The population of County Meath has increased by over one third in the last few years. It now has a population of 160,000, heading towards 200,000 rapidly. The local authority is only getting 70% of the national average in funding, despite all the problems that thousands of extra houses bring. There are 20,000 people commuting to Dublin from Meath every day. Massive problems have been created in the county but no money follows suit. It is fine to talk here about legislation which looks good on paper but if we do not back it up with proper resources, it is a waste of time. It is worth noting that while the money Meath gets to run the local authority is 70% of the national average, the tax take from the county is 110% of the national average. It is losing out in one area and giving too much in another. That is a raw deal for a county that is in the greater Dublin region and it is the counties in that region that have suffered most from lack of building and planning control.</P>
      <P>We may have missed the boat with this legislation. Much damage has already been done and we will suffer for a long time to come. Some people who have 40 year mortgages will, due to a lack of building control, find themselves in houses that will not stand for 40 years without a lot of money being spent on them to patch them up. That is a shame and it is letting people down, and it is what we have done when it comes to building and planning control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a long-awaited Bill. Many of us have received numerous representations particularly with regard to professional qualifications and registration of those qualifications. <Col N="1965"/>The provisions within the Bill in that context are very welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill also gives us an opportunity to talk about the construction industry in general and Government policies on construction. Given the hand-in-glove relationship between the largest party in Government and the construction industry, it might be in better order to call this the &ldquo;Building Out of Control Bill&rdquo;. Many aspects of construction, over the last decade in particular, have brought about severe social and environmental consequences, with which Government policies have been unable to deal.</P>
      <P>It has been boasted that one third of all residences in this country have been built since 1995, a frightening statistic. It is proof positive that much of that building has been done in an unregulated and unplanned way and has produced buildings of dubious quality for which we, as a society, will pay for many generations. Even the provisions within this Bill that address future building and bringing about better standards of construction, particularly in the area of energy efficiency, seem very much an exercise in closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. Given the housing stock that already exists in our society and the wanton way in which construction was allowed to take place, this Bill is several years too late. We must put on the record of the House the failure of Government policies to put in place legislation of this type when it was needed for the type of construction that has been taking place here.</P>
      <P>We have curious planning laws that on paper allow maximum public participation in terms of allowing concerns to be placed on record and responded to. However, the reality for many individual citizens and communities is that the planning system is unable to respond, partly because the resources of individual local authorities are far from adequate but mainly because of an attitude fostered by this Government, and by the largest party in Government in particular, that all development, of any type, is always welcome. If there is any need for legislation on building control, it must be to challenge this particular philosophy. The idea that cranes dotted across the skyline are themselves inherently good and what is being constructed will be to the betterment of our society needs to be questioned.</P>
      <P>While there are provisions in the Bill that address different types of quality control, much of which has been imposed on the Government through European Union legislation, there is nothing in it that deals with the aesthetics of quality control and the type of ugly, dull, cold, functional buildings that are dotted around the country, with no thought for what we are bequeathing to future generations. It is a major flaw in our planning systems that planning applications cannot be refused on the basis that the buildings being proposed do not fit in with the existing built environment and are just plain ugly in terms of <Col N="1966"/>what is being proposed and what is eventually constructed.</P>
      <P>In the context of the construction boom we have had since the 1990s, we are developing within our town and city centres a type of blandness that takes away any sense of the character of these areas that would have been slowly built up over generations by using traditional materials and styles of architecture. In pursuing an agenda of getting the maximum number of buildings up in the quickest possible time while making the largest amount of profit, we are wasting the architectural credit that we have built up through the years. That one can pass through any town without being able to identify particular characteristics that differentiate it from any other Irish centre is a tragedy. If we are serious about building control, that is an area the legislation should address.</P>
      <P>There are other issues that are of more immediate concern. Part of this has to do not only with the control of building in terms of quality but also with the quality of builders. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, a constituency colleague would not have been present at a recent meeting with Cork building unions where there was a discussion on difficulties on building sites and how subcontractors are sourcing workers to work on many of the construction sites in our constituency. This raises concerns about how wages are being undercut, how workers from outside the country are being abused in terms of their rights and entitlements and how the quality of the work on the construction sites may be compromised because of the pursuit of maximising profit and making use of whatever advantages exist for construction companies while the going is good.</P>
      <P>Today the European Central Bank increased by 0.25% the bank interest rate for the second time in six months. It is likely that by the end of the year the bank lending rate will have increased by a full percentage point. We are living in a society where indebtedness, mainly caused by huge mortgages, for each citizen is 160% of their average income. We have pursued this policy of untargeted tax reliefs from which individuals and companies have gained huge benefits from creating buildings that are little more than cardboard boxes in which people must live subsequently, and the only people who appear to have benefited has been that small cohort in society.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Government policies are directly responsible for this huge imbalance in what is being built, where it is built, for whom it is being built and who is benefiting from it. There is a need for a wiser Government to look at a longer-term picture of planning and development. Certainly this is not such a Government. This has been a short-term, get rich quick Government in terms of construction. There is a price to be paid for deserts of housing estates, one after the other, without <Col N="1967"/>proper social facilities, transport links and the basic infrastructure of water and sewerage systems. On these grounds the Government must stand indicted.</P>
      <P>We have created an environment in terms of our buildings in which people cannot expect anything more than the lowest possible standard. If we are looking for hope in regard to our future building stock, it must come through the various EU directives because it will come directly from this Government. The need to take responsibility for what is being built and how it is built will not come from the Government because of the nature of its relationship with the construction industry. We must enforce standards that are imposed on us from outside, the type that exist in other European countries where the question asked is why what is being built is being built. In the current climate it does not seem important to ask that question because building in itself has the value the Government decides. Until we get away from that type of ghettoising approach, not much will change in that area.</P>
      <P>Where the Bill is also deficient and where it could have had more pointers to the future is not only in the area of energy efficiency but also in directing future construction along the right types of building materials or at least a more diversified use of building materials. The excessive use of concrete has led to massive environmental consequences not only in terms of energy efficiency but the pock-marked nature of many landscapes throughout the country from quarrying.</P>
      <P>While I realise the Minister of State is going to further fields in future elections, not far from the constituency we represent in east Cork is the Midleton-Carrigtwohill area. Anyone who has seen the aerial photographs taken of the area would think they were looking at either a lunar landscape or some type of advanced golf course for hard-bitten golfers who want to get out of bunkers that are 40 feet deep. Those are the environmental consequences of a building programme that is reliant almost solely on concrete materials.</P>
      <P>There are alternatives that are not only cheaper to make and provide more cost effective and more heat efficient housing but also give people an opportunity of getting into the house market at a level they can afford. The burden of debt by which people are being crippled is beyond understanding and will be beyond forgiveness when the bubble eventually bursts. We are not talking about bank interest rate increases of 0.25% but 1% increases at a time, and that is not too far away.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I would not consider myself particularly aged but I have certainly slipped into middle age and have 18 years of marriage behind me. I bought a house in 1987 for the princely sum of &pound;24,500 for which I got a housing finance agency loan of &euro;17,000. I managed to get &euro;3,000 from the local credit union, supposedly for house furnishings <Col N="1968"/>which did not arrive for several years later, and the balance from a relative in England who gave me a &pound;5,000 sterling loan which I paid back at terms. When I think of what my wife and I had to go through 20 years ago, I try to put myself in the position of young couples who are trying to do exactly the same a generation later and I do not know how they do it. I barely did it then. It is obvious they are doing it through the finance packages being offered by financial institutions of 100% loans, grant-parenting mortgages where parents act as guarantors for whatever mortgage loans are available and, increasingly, through getting 30 or 40-year mortgages.</P>
      <P>If this is the society we are seeking to build, where houses are little more than cardboard boxes because of the lack of building control, I would like someone to take responsibility and not boast and gloat about activity that in many respects has been damaging and fruitless for those who end up living in these houses. We have not built houses worth living in. We have destroyed communities that should have been fostered and on these grounds the Building Control Bill will do little to solve the problems that have been created.</P>
      <P>I would like to finish by welcoming the aspects of the Bill that will further improve standards in building control. We have talked about the professional qualifications and the register of those qualifications. The energy efficiency rating for future building is long overdue and I would like to see it made retrospective. The real challenge for any future Government is to ensure that future housing stock is energy efficient and the existing housing stock is made energy efficient. That is the problem that needs to be tackled in light of our greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I share the fear expressed by previous speakers that, regardless of the form in which this Bill &mdash; which I suspect is relatively uncontentious &mdash; is passed by this House, the current problems will continue when the Bill comes to be implemented by local authorities. Due to lack of resources and personnel, local authority planning and building control departments cannot cope with the amount of work that is currently asked of them. Given that the Bill will ask local authorities to do even more work that is of a higher standard, I fear this string will be stretched even further. Although the intention behind the Bill is to improve quality, I suspect quality might slip even further unless the Government is prepared to back up that intention with appropriate resources on a large scale. If the problems I have outlined intensify in the future, none of us will take any great pleasure in the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and I have listened with great <Col N="1969"/>interest to Deputies&rsquo; valuable Second Stage contributions. We acknowledge the non-partisan approach adopted by Deputies, who have welcomed the Bill and supported its broad objectives while raising legitimate issues and queries about the details of the Bill&rsquo;s seven parts and 68 sections. As most Bills presented to the House can be improved through amendment, we will carefully consider all amendments proposed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>To recap, the Building Control Bill 2005 has three main objectives: to strengthen the enforcement powers of local building control authorities and to improve the accessibility of buildings for people with disabilities; to transpose certain provisions of the European Union energy performance of buildings directive; and to provide for the registration of the titles &ldquo;architect&rdquo;, &ldquo;quantity surveyor&rdquo; and &ldquo;building surveyor&rdquo;. I will respond to the Second Reading debate in the order in which these objectives are dealt with in the Bill. Unfortunately, time does not permit me to respond to all matters raised by Deputies so I will focus on those that appear to be the core issues. Perhaps we can return to the other matters on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>On the issue of enforcement, it is safe to say there is universal support in this House for the introduction of a disability access certificate, as recommended by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I agree with many Deputies that the building code enforcement provisions, as strengthened by the Bill, will be of no real value unless they are actively invoked by local building control authorities. As already mentioned, Deputy Roche will write to each city council and county council manager to ask them to take personal responsibility for improving enforcement at local level.</P>
      <P>Although the Government aims to regulate and control the number of staff employed in the public service including those in local authorities within agreed ceilings, we will attach a high priority to the implementation of the Bill when it is enacted. We are keeping the overall employment position in local authorities under review. Obviously, there are many competing demands over the wide range of local authority functions due to the expanding economy, but the Minister will take the necessary steps, along with his colleague the Minister for Finance, to ensure that essential staff are employed to give effect to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We accept that the statistical data available to my Department on building control enforcement are somewhat limited and need to be improved. However, building control officers have said that we should not measure enforcement activity solely by the numbers of enforcement notices, injunctions and prosecutions. They argue that such legal procedures are ultimately a measure of the failure rather than success of the building control system in individual cases. Non-com<Col N="1970"/>pliance issues are often successfully resolved by discussions and correspondence between building control officers and builders. My Department has asked local building control authorities that data relating to this more informal enforcement activity be included in the statistical returns for the second half of 2005. My Department will also seek a breakdown of future data to identify which parts of the building regulations are the subject of non-compliance enforcement procedures and proceedings.</P>
      <P>We agree with Deputy Twomey that it is vital that measures be taken to prevent the spread of fire in apartment blocks. Such measures are required under part B of the Building Regulations 1997, which deals with fire safety. The design of all new apartment blocks &mdash; irrespective of the type of construction involved &mdash; must be certified as compliant with part B by the local building control authority. It is the duty of the builder to construct apartments in accordance with the certified design.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dennehy expressed concern about the feasibility of fighting fires in tall buildings. It is true that fire ladders and external fire hoses can generally only reach up to seven or eight storeys. Accordingly, fire safety design in tall buildings is generally based on: the early detection of fires, through smoke alarms and heat detection systems; rapid evacuation of all occupants, through emergency stairways compartmentalised against smoke; and fighting fires using water supplies from internal fire hydrants located on each floor.</P>
      <P>Deputies also expressed concern about the desirability and practicability of retrospectively regularising fire safety certificates after building works have been started or completed. As local building control authorities have granted retrospective certificates on a pragmatic basis over the years, the Bill will simply provide a clear legal basis for established practice. We agree with Deputies Murphy and O&rsquo;Dowd that the ideal situation would be for developers to secure the certificate before work commences. We acknowledge that the seven days&rsquo; notice procedure allows developers a legal mechanism to start urgent development projects before certification. However, we stress that this procedure is subject to an undertaking by the developer to carry out any work modifications required by the fire safety certificate when it is granted. This is modelled on a similar provision in the building code for England and Wales.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the option of introducing a system for the mandatory self-certification of compliance, as recommended in the 2004 report of a joint working group representing the building professions. The report acknowledges that, if the principle of mandatory self-certification is accepted, the Building Control Act 1990 would need to be amended and the details of the respective responsibilities of designers, main contractors and specialist sub-contractors <Col N="1971"/>would need to be worked out. My Department has considered the 2004 report but has a number of reservations about self-certification. First, there is a potential conflict of interest between a certifier&rsquo;s business relationship with the client who commissions the building and the certifier&rsquo;s duty properly to certify compliance to the building control authority. Second, the unfortunate reality is that some building professionals have been willing to issue compliance certificates for non-compliant building works under the Law Society&rsquo;s opinion on compliance system, which has been in operation since the early 1990s. This is acknowledged in the working group&rsquo;s report. Finally, there are major issues surrounding the arrangement, organisation and funding of essential independent audits of self-certification and the liability of auditors for any deficient certification.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn pointed out that the registration of architects and surveyors under the Bill will introduce a mechanism for establishing who is entitled to self-certify. He suggested that this mechanism could also be used subsequently in the regulation of professional conduct and should act as a disincentive to dishonest self-certification. However, my Department would need to do much more work, in partnership with all the stakeholders, before the Government would be in a position to recommend the necessary enabling and amending legislation. We doubt that this process could be engaged in during the enactment of this Bill but we are willing to start work on it when it is enacted.</P>
      <P>Much has been said in the media about the alleged tardiness of Ireland in transposing the EU directive on the energy performance of buildings. This is based on a misunderstanding that all the provisions of this directive should have been transposed on January 2006. Article 15 of the directive allows member states until 4 January 2009 to transpose the provisions relating to the building energy rating under Article 7, promotion of the energy efficiency of boilers under Article 8 and mandatory inspection of air conditioning systems under Article 9. Article 15 is an acknowledgement by the European Union than Articles 7 to 9 are demanding requirements that involve complex supporting technical and administrative arrangements.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that other EU member states are also grappling with the complexities involved. I understand that, as of 31 January 2006, only ten member states, including Ireland, or 40% of the 25 member states, had notified the European Commission of partial or total transposition of this directive. All ten member states propose to defer full implementation beyond January 2006.</P>
      <P>We are commencing the energy rating of over 80,000 new houses annually in 2007, as such rating can initially be done off plans. We will move on to the rating of existing houses, when sold or let, <Col N="1972"/>by 2009. This will involve the physical inspection of an estimated 100,000 houses annually. The energy rating will generally be done by building professionals in private practice who will undergo training of about one week&rsquo;s duration. Sustainable Energy Ireland plans to arrange the training of up to an estimated 2,000 building professionals in energy rating over the period 2006-09.</P>
      <P>All sides of the House have welcomed the proposal to register the titles of &ldquo;architect&rdquo;, &ldquo;quantity surveyor&rdquo; and &ldquo;building surveyor&rdquo;. There is more or less universal agreement that the time has come to protect consumers from unqualified persons passing themselves off as building professionals to unsuspecting citizens building new houses or undertaking house extensions. The relevant building professional organisations, led by the RIAI and SCS, were consulted on a confidential basis during the drafting of the provisions in Parts 3 to 7 of the Bill. However, these organisations are proposing a number of refinements of the Bill, as published, and these will all be carefully considered on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In reply to points made by Deputy Broughan and Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley it should be noted that under the Building Control Act 1990, there has always been a right of appeal against the refusal of fire safety certificates or conditions attached to these certificates consistent with the principles of natural justice. This right of appeal is being extended to the new disability access certificate. Ireland&rsquo;s insulation standards are among the highest in Europe. The grant scheme for the installation of renewable energy systems in individual houses will shortly be announced by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their considered contributions and we look forward to a constructive debate on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first substantive debate by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Transport 21 and I welcome the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s programme for transport investment over the period 2006-15. Unlike before, we now have the resources to improve <Col N="1973"/>our infrastructure. This is because of the hard work and enterprise of the people and a Government that works with them.</P>
      <P>The seeds of Transport 21 were sown in the decision taken in 2005 budget by the Minister for Finance to implement an extended ten-year capital envelope for transport investment. That important decision was a recognition of the reality of the long timeframes involved in planning, designing and completing large transport infrastructure programmes.</P>
      <P>The period between budget 2005 and the announcement of Transport 21 in Dublin Castle on 1 November was used by my Department to develop what is without doubt the most detailed and comprehensive transport plan ever devised in this country. The roots of Transport 21 extend back to June 2002 and the decision by the Government to establish, for the first time in the history of the State, a single Department with responsibility for national roads, aviation and public transport. The reason for doing so, as clearly stated at that time, was to further the development of an integrated transport system nationally.</P>
      <P>The specific mandate given to the Department of Transport by the Government was to implement an integrated transport policy designed as far as possible to overcome existing delays, bottlenecks and congestion and to provide the consumer with greater choice by offering alternative modes of transport. In addition, through the integrated approach, the Department was expected to develop and implement policies designed to improve regional balance and reduce rural isolation and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, the Department has undertaken substantial work on integration in consultation with other Departments and State agencies. This work takes account of Government policy documents, particularly the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines. The result is a set of guiding principles for integrated transport policy, which is published in the Department of Transport&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy, 2005-2007. These principles provided an important policy backdrop for the preparation of the integrated investment strategy contained in Transport 21.</P>
      <P>In preparing Transport 21, the Department also took account of the work already done on investment priorities under the existing capital envelope and of the various strategic studies already completed by my Department and its agencies, including A Platform for Change, the strategic rail review and the National Road Needs Study. The Department also engaged with its State agencies, C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Transportation Office, and relevant Departments to identify the broad direction and priorities of the investment framework. The result of all this detailed and painstaking work is a transport investment strategy that, for the first time, allocated funding for a ten-year <Col N="1974"/>period to develop an integrated transport network that substantially enhances connectivity and provides for the development of an integrated transport network in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members will be familiar with the details of the projects at this stage and I will not deal with the specifics today. However, Transport 21 can be summarised as follows: completion of the major inter-urban motorways by 2010 and the commencement of the substantial development of the remainder of the national primary road network; transformation of the transport system in the greater Dublin area, with particular focus on the public transport network; completion of the renewal of the national rail network, with a major focus on the provision of enhanced services; and upgrading of the public transport services in provincial cities and the regions.</P>
      <P>While the individual projects that make up Transport 21 are important in their own right, the most significant aspect of the programme is the manner in which these individual elements are integrated to provide a highly efficient national transport network that maximises the benefit of the investment for the population at large.</P>
      <P>Transport 21 has been specifically developed with a view to supporting the Government&rsquo;s national spatial strategy, which seeks to promote more balanced regional development. This was an important issue for me in the preparation of Transport 21, as I was responsible for bringing the national spatial strategy to fruition during my time as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I am satisfied that, when taken together, Transport 21 and the national spatial strategy clearly demonstrate the joined-up thinking of the Government in the areas of transportation and spatial planning. These Government initiatives will contribute to sustainable development in all its dimensions, economic, social and environmental.</P>
      <P>I wish to turn to the important issues of costs and value for money. Transport 21 is a fully costed programme. Its cost of &euro;34.4 billion is based on the aggregate costs of its constituent projects, which are, in turn, primarily based on costs provided by the transport agencies. It has been confirmed by the agencies that the costs and underlying assumptions are as rigorous as possible, taking account of the various stages of development, design and implementation of the projects. I am satisfied, on this basis, that the total funding commitment of &euro;34.4 billion is sufficient for the full implementation of Transport 21. The programme has been criticised in some quarters on the basis that the costs of its individual projects have not been made public. I do not consider it prudent to release such commercially sensitive information until the public procurement processes for individual projects are completed. Some elements of Transport 21, such as traffic management, have global financial provisions rather than individual project allocations.</P><Col N="1975"/>
      <P>In recent times, most road and public transport projects have been coming in on budget and many of them have been ahead of schedule. While this augurs well for the successful implementation of Transport 21, significant safeguards are being put in place to ensure Transport 21 is delivered within budget and within the stipulated timeframe. Transport 21 projects will be subject to normal statutory procedures, where required, capital appraisal in line with the Department of Finance&rsquo;s guidelines and the value for money initiatives which were announced by the Minister for Finance last October. The Department of Transport will be responsible for overseeing the implementation, by the various transport agencies and local authorities, of Transport 21. I am establishing a monitoring group, to be chaired by the Department of Transport, which will comprise representatives of all other relevant Departments. The group will be responsible for the high-level monitoring of Transport 21 and will report annually to the Government on issues such as financial and physical progress. Transport 21 addresses the important issue of the capital investment framework for transport for the next ten years. While capital investment is critical, it is just one element of the delivery of an integrated transport system.</P>
      <P>When I launched Transport 21, I said I was convinced that a new approach to transport in the greater Dublin area needs to be delivered through a single authority with real powers to ensure there is joined-up thinking and delivery across all transport modes. A high-level four-member team, which is chaired by Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony and reports directly to me, has been appointed since then. It is charged with finalising a structure for the new transport authority, detailing its remit and responsibilities and identifying the human resources which are critical to its success, taking into account best international practice and experience. The new authority will have responsibility for transport in the greater Dublin area. I did not set any restrictions or limitations on the four-member team&rsquo;s considerations on how the role of the new authority will interact with the future role of other transport bodies in the greater Dublin area. The team is finalising its report and I look forward to examining its findings at an early stage. I intend to bring proposals to the Government for decision as soon as I have considered the team&rsquo;s report. The establishment of the Dublin transport authority will be another crucial step in ensuring the full and timely delivery of Transport 21.</P>
      <P>As delivery is a such critical aspect of Transport 21, I have set out clearly the completion dates of key projects. My primary focus is on ensuring that such deadlines are fully met. I am encouraged by the progress that has been made since the launch of Transport 21. I am satisfied the completion dates are realistic and achievable. In 2006, the National Roads Authority expects to <Col N="1976"/>complete some 13 projects with a combined length of 82 km and to commence work on 15 projects with a combined length of 334 km. A further 11 projects which are under way will continue construction during 2006. Since the launch of Transport 21, three roads projects have opened to traffic &mdash; the N6 Kinnegad to Enfield bypass, the N22 Gortatlea to Farranfore development and N6 Loughrea bypass &mdash; and work has commenced on three projects &mdash; the N5 Charlestown bypass, the N51 Navan inner relief road and phase one of the M50 upgrade. The latter project will involve the widening of 31 km of motorway from two to three lanes in each direction and the upgrade of the interchanges along this section. The upgrade will take place in two phases, the first of which comprises the widening of the carriageway between the N7 and N4 interchanges and the upgrading of those interchanges. Contracts have been signed and construction will start in a matter of weeks, to be completed by mid-2008, after which it is planned to move to barrier-free tolling.</P>
      <P>We are also making real progress on public transport. Four of the seven Luas projects highlighted in Transport 21 have already been advanced. The Railway Procurement Agency has submitted railway order applications in respect of Luas extensions from Sandyford to Cherrywood and from Connolly Station to the docklands. I have appointed an inspector to hold public inquiries into the two applications. The Cherrywood inquiry began on Monday last and, subject to the outcome, it is expected that construction contracts will be awarded later in 2006. It is expected the public inquiry for the docklands extension will begin in May 2006. The RPA is also carrying out public consultations on linking the two existing Luas lines in the city centre, on which an announcement on the preferred route is expected shortly, and on the extension from Tallaght to Citywest. The RPA expects to commence public consultation on the extension from Cherrywood to Bray this month, while a feasibility study on route alignments for the Lucan Luas line is under way. The capacity enhancement project on the Tallaght Luas line is on schedule to deliver an additional 40% in capacity by 2008, by means of the extension of the trams from 30 m to 40 m.</P>
      <P>I was happy last Tuesday to launch the public consultation process on the selection of the best route for metro north, which will lead to 41,000 cars a day being removed from Dublin&rsquo;s streets. There will be a metro every 90 seconds, travelling from the city centre to Dublin Airport in 17 minutes and from the city centre to Swords in 26 minutes. It is estimated that at least 80,000 passengers a day will be carried on metro north, which will integrate with Luas, bus, cycling, taxi and rail services and with park and ride services at Swords and Ballymun. Metro north will integrate with metro west, the Maynooth rail line, the Tallaght and Sandyford Luas lines and DART via <Col N="1977"/>the interconnector at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green. The consultation provides outlines for three route options for metro north. It has been indicated that the central route is the strongest from a number of points of view including construction feasibility, fulfilling transportation needs and capital cost. However, the final route will not be chosen until the public consultation process has been concluded, the people have had an opportunity to give their views and the railway order processes have been completed. The RPA will consult widely with people living and working in the city, public representatives, agencies and local authorities, thereby giving people an opportunity to express their views and have them taken into account in the implementation of the project. The RPA is also undertaking a study on route alignments for metro west.</P>
      <P>Significant progress is also being made by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. A public inquiry into the application for a railway order for the Kildare route project was completed on 2 February. I expect to receive the inspector&rsquo;s findings in the coming weeks. Subject to the issue of the railway order, construction work on the project will commence in the second half of this year. An application for funding from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the construction of a new railway station in the docklands is being assessed by the Department of Transport. If the proposal is found to be acceptable, work is due to commence by the end of 2006. Other projects are being planned outside Dublin. Design work on the Cork commuter rail project has almost been completed. An application for a railway order for the project is expected by the end of April. Subject to the completion of that process and the granting of a railway order, construction will commence by the end of the year. The proposals submitted by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the first phase of the western rail corridor, between Ennis and Athenry, are being examined. I look forward to outlining further progress in this regard in the near future. The first of 67 new rail carriages for the Dublin to Cork railway route will come into service later this month. All of the carriages will be in service by the end of 2006, thereby facilitating the operation of a service on the route every hour. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has placed an order for 150 railcars to operate on the remaining intercity routes. The delivery of the railcars will begin in 2007.</P>
      <P>At the launch of Transport 21 in November, I repeated my view that buses will continue to play a crucial role in the public transport system. Buses will continue to carry the greatest number of people of all public transport modes even after the significant modal shift has taken place. As I told the D&aacute;il previously, Dublin Bus submitted an application for additional fleet requirements in 2006 and 2007, comprising 200 buses and a new garage. The Department is examining the application with regard to the findings of the Dublin bus network review, which has been submitted by Dublin Bus, and proposals on the reform of the <Col N="1978"/>bus market. The Department is examining proposals from Bus &Eacute;ireann about the development of its fleet between 2006 and 2008. The relevant implementing agencies are responsible for identifying the project milestones necessary to achieve the completion deadlines. The structures I am putting in place &mdash; the new transport authority for Dublin and the high-level monitoring group &mdash; will assist in ensuring projects are delivered in the published timeframes.</P>
      <P>We have seen the beginning of a new dawn in the transport sector in recent times. High-quality roads have been opened and enhanced public transport services such as Luas have come on stream to provide more comfortable, more efficient and safer services. The Government is now focusing clearly on implementation and delivery. The implementation of Transport 21 will give Ireland a first-class transport system that will connect all regions to each other and to our main seaports and airports and will provide greatly enhanced public transport alternatives to the private car in our cities. Transport 21 will give us a transport network that underpins Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, promotes balanced regional growth and enhances the quality of life of all citizens for generations to come.</P>

        <Quest>her views on extending the working date for hospital consultants; if it is part of the present contract negotiations; the negotiations which have taken place to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8735/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of the 1997 consultant contract, each consultant is contracted to work within the normal working week from Monday to Friday. Most consultants are also available on an on-call basis outside these hours. In 2003, the national task force on medical staffing recommended that health professionals should work as part of a multidisciplinary team centred on delivering quality patient care over the full 24-hour period. Since 2003, management has sought to begin substantive negotiations on a new contract with the medical organisations. For a number of reasons, including the organisations&rsquo; opposition to the extension of the clinical indemnity scheme to consultants, both the IMO and the IHCA did not begin talks until November 2005.</P>
        <P>Talks on a new contract began on 24 November 2005 under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Mark Connaughton SC. At that meeting and at a <Col N="1979"/>further plenary meeting in December, both the IHCA and the IMO indicated that they required a number of issues to be addressed before they could engage in substantive negotiations on a new contract. A position paper outlining proposals on a new employment contract for consultants working in the public health system was tabled by management at a plenary meeting on 26 January 2006. The medical organisations have refused to engage in substantive discussions on these proposals. The talks were adjourned at a further meeting on 9 February. While a further meeting between management and the consultant representative bodies has not yet been arranged, the independent chairman is maintaining contact with both sides with a view to arranging a formula to effect the resumption of substantive and intensive negotiations at an early date.</P>
        <P>In its proposals to the medical organisations, the management team has outlined the need for consultants to work a 39-hour commitment over the 24-hour, seven-day period agreed and detailed in an annual work plan for each consultant. Work plans will follow a framework developed at national level and will be reviewed and agreed annually by consultants, clinical managers and management.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The key objective of the new contract is to address the needs of all patients by achieving greater equity and increasing productivity in a consultant-provided 24-hour, seven-day hospital service. This will ensure that patients have access to senior clinical decision makers, that is, the consultants, when they need them. Rapid access to consultants will speed up diagnosis and treatment and reduce the need for repeated reviews by junior medical or other staff. It will also mean that patient or clinical need determines the nature of rostering arrangements for consultants and that patient access to care and the speed with which care is delivered is determined only by clinical need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Department ever seriously considered extending the consultants&rsquo; working day from its current format of 8 a.m. to whenever? If work was done on the issue in the Department, what were the difficulties encountered in extending the consultants&rsquo; work time? The four-page document given to the consultants by the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Minister did not mention extending the consultants&rsquo; working day. I thought such an extension would have been an integral part of both the European working time directive and the Minister&rsquo;s plan, namely, the Hanly report. Why does this aspect not feature in the renegotiation of the consultants&rsquo; contract? Has the Department more or less rejected the idea of extending the working day?</P><Col N="1980"/>
        <P>I understand what the Minister says about the negotiations with consultants not happening, but there is nothing coming from the Department indicating that she has any great interest in it either. What background documents does she have? What difficulties does she think she will encounter, apart from those with the consultants? The extension of the consultants&rsquo; working day would make outpatients clinics more available, but that idea seems to have fallen off the radar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct. The idea is to provide a 24-hour, seven-day service delivered, rather than led, by the consultants. There are 4,000 non-consultant hospital doctors and 2,000 consultants working in this country and we need to change that ratio around if we are to have consultant delivered services. The commitment in the current contract is for 39 hours to public service work and we want to change that. We want to introduce a new contract for full-time public consultants so that consultants are not incentivised to see one patient over another and that all patients who enter a public hospital will be seen by a consultant who is salaried to see them. As part of any new contract of employment, we want to have consultants employed on a 24-hour, seven-day basis. These issues must be agreed in the negotiations. It is not correct to say that we are trying to have an 8 a.m to 5 p.m. day for consultants. Consultants will be expected to work evenings, nights and weekends. Perhaps that could be excluded for older consultants, but it would be the norm for younger consultants and part of their contract of employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>My question has not been answered. The idea was to extend the core working day. Discussions on this issue went back to 1999 when we first raised the idea of extending the consultants&rsquo; core working day. That seems to have fallen off the radar completely. Why is that the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless we can change the current consultant contract, it is not feasible to negotiate the extension of the working day either from a personnel perspective or a financial perspective. To address one issue in isolation is not satisfactory. Consultants have a contract of employment that lasts their working career. Either side can break or alter the contract, but there are serious financial implications if that is done.</P>
        <P>We want a new contract for new consultants which is more modern and which involves consultants working in teams with clinical directors and so on. The clinical director would be responsible for ensuring that consultant cover is provided on an ongoing basis. However, it would not be satisfactory to negotiate it in isolation from the other issues.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 5 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the Lourdes Hospital inquiry, chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark, was published on Tuesday, 28 February. The inquiry was established by the Government in 2004, following the decision of the Medical Council to remove Dr. Michael Neary from the register of medical practitioners, having found him guilty of professional misconduct.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the last few years have been particularly difficult and traumatic for many former patients of the maternity unit at Drogheda. Yesterday, I met Patient Focus to discuss the findings of the report. The question of compensation will now be considered by my Department in the light of the report&rsquo;s findings and in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance, with a view to bringing a proposal to Government.</P>
        <P>This is a damning report and it is clear from the findings that many lessons need to be learned and changes made to ensure that such events do not occur again in hospitals. The findings and recommendations are being examined in detail by my Department, which will consult the Health Service Executive and the various professional regulatory bodies. The recommendations in the report will act as a significant catalyst in the reform agenda. They confirm the appropriateness of the actions being taken in the preparation of the new medical practitioners Bill, the reform of the current consultant contract and the changes in management systems within hospitals.</P>
        <P>The forthcoming medical practitioners Bill will make continuing professional development and education compulsory. It will also ensure that competence assurance will be given a statutory basis. In the current consultant contract talks, the management side has put forward proposals to ensure that consultants work in teams with clear <Col N="1982"/>clinical leaders who will ensure that individual clinical practice is in line with best practice.</P>
        <P>One of the many disturbing findings in the report is that the obstetric hysterectomy records of 44 patients are missing and that they were intentionally and unlawfully removed from the hospital with the object of protecting those involved in carrying out the hysterectomies or in protecting the reputation of the hospital. The inquiry is satisfied that a person or persons unidentified who had knowledge of where records were stored and who had easy access to those records was responsible for a deliberate, careful and systematic removal of key historical records which are missing, together with master cards and patient charts. In respect of the conclusions on the deliberate removal of patient records, I have invited the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine the report to determine whether further investigation is now warranted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact the Minister for Health and Children met Patient Focus yesterday. I also welcome the women in the Visitors Gallery who were injured so brutally. I appreciate that the detail of the compensation scheme may not be available yet but the Minister can give us certain assurances today. Will she ensure that all women affected will be included in the compensation scheme, that is, not just those who came within the terms of reference of the report but also women who had their ovaries removed or women whose babies died in the unit? Will Patient Focus and the women be involved in drawing up the terms of reference of the compensation scheme, as was indicated by the Minister?</P>
        <P>With regard to how the scheme will be managed, will the Minister ensure that the women will not have to endure undue delay while the Minister, the insurers and the hospital wrangle about how much money each will contribute? Can the Minister state that the women will get their compensation and that she will then live up to her responsibility to protect the taxpayer? The women must come first. Will the report be referred to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children after next Wednesday&rsquo;s debate? The Taoiseach, rather curiously, said yesterday that some of the recommendations would be implemented and some would be taken into account. The phrase &ldquo;taken into account&rdquo; is code for not being implemented. Will the Minister differentiate between the ones that will and will not be implemented?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that the women come first. It is heartbreaking to hear their stories at first hand, as I did yesterday and on a previous occasion, and to hear of the experience of so many women, many of them as young as 20 years of age, when this happened. It is just incredible. It is extraordinary, as many have acknowledged, including the Deputy, that this went undetected for so long. That is probably one of the most <Col N="1983"/>extraordinary aspects of this sad episode. The cause of the women comes first and that is my main focus at present. In the discussions I had yesterday I gave the women that assurance. They have waited eight years to get to this point and it has taken longer than anybody could have anticipated. However, they, together with everybody else who has read it, welcome the report. They see it as thorough, robust and fair.</P>
        <P>Next Monday, I hope to meet Judge Maureen Harding Clark. She is currently in The Hague and will return to Ireland on Monday. I am anxious to hear her ideas about routes for compensation. The Government has not formalised any compensation scheme but the Taoiseach and I have acknowledged that we want to do this. I want to do it as quickly as possible. I certainly do not want the affected women to be forced to take the legal route to get compensation in this case. In any event, given that 44 files have been stolen, it would not be possible for those women ever to vindicate their rights through the judicial process. We have, therefore, an obligation to ensure they are taken care of.</P>
        <P>I am happy to ensure the report goes to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children after the debate next Wednesday. I have already arranged to meet the Medical Council on Monday to discuss the report. I am not aware of any recommendation that will not be implemented or cannot be acted upon. I have not had an opportunity to study all the recommendations but it is my intention to take on board the recommendations of Judge Maureen Harding Clark. In all the circumstances, they are reasonable.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, my meetings with four members of the medical board of the hospital and, separately, with the management of the hospital were focused on putting the remaining recommendations relating to that unit into effect as quickly as possible. John O&rsquo;Brien from the national hospitals office in the HSE and his team will be in the hospital next week to put a process in place to make that happen as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I hope both Deputy McManus and I will have time for a brief supplementary question later. Can the T&aacute;naiste indicate if legislation will be required to establish the redress scheme she envisages so the women vic<Col N="1984"/>tims of Mr. Neary and others can win redress? I stress, as I did yesterday, the phrase &ldquo;and others&rdquo;. It was not only Dr. Neary who was involved. What is the timescale for the commencement of processing the cases through the redress scheme? How soon does she expect such a process can get under way?</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste stated that the Harding Clark report confirms the appropriateness of the actions being taken with regard to reform of the current consultant contract and changes in management systems within the hospitals. I asked the Taoiseach questions about this yesterday but he did not reply to them. The reform of the consultants&rsquo; contract has been overdue since 2002. Judge Maureen Harding Clark made particular reference to this. What is the position with the renegotiation of the common contract? Has it reached a brick wall? What is the Minister&rsquo;s intent in that regard?</P>
        <P>I hope the T&aacute;naiste studies all the recommendations of Judge Maureen Harding Clark. The judge stated in the report that consultants at the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital currently spend too much of their time on private patients. Has the T&aacute;naiste noted that point and does she accept that it is an ongoing problem, as Judge Maureen Harding Clark does, and is directly related to my earlier question about the consultants&rsquo; contract? Has the T&aacute;naiste noted from the report that while it is acknowledged that much has changed for the better at the Lourdes hospital, Judge Harding Clark also states that there are still worrying things ongoing at the hospital? Has she noted the judge&rsquo;s criticism of the risk management among some of the consultants and the judge&rsquo;s statement that no elective major gynaecology operations are carried out as there are no dedicated gynaecology beds available for elective operations?</P>
        <P>What will the T&aacute;naiste do about the failure to designate gynaecology beds to cater for elective surgical procedures at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the only site with such a specialist team in the north-east region?</P>

	<P>To the best of my knowledge, legislation will not be necessary for a redress scheme but it might be necessary to pursue insurers. However, we do not need to wait for that legislation to proceed with the scheme. In other words, we can pursue the legislation while the scheme is under way. I am determined to ensure, if possible, that the State pursues the insurers and that the taxpayer does not carry all the cost of a compensation scheme.</P>
        <P>The intention is to go to the Government on this quickly. I told Patient Focus yesterday it will certainly be during March and as early in the month as possible. I have already had discussions with the Attorney General and I will meet the judge next Monday as well as the Attorney General. As soon as all the pieces are together, I will go to the Government to secure approval for <Col N="1985"/>a scheme. We will not be found wanting in terms of the speed at which we make this happen. It is important that, in so far as one can bring closure to this sad episode, it is done as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>With regard to the consultant contract, the reason we want a public only contract is precisely that identified by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. There is increasing evidence throughout the country that more private patients are coming into the public hospital system. The Government&rsquo;s decision to move up to 1,000 private beds out of the public hospital system is made with the intention of converting those beds into public beds. That will apply in Drogheda, hopefully, as much as it applies everywhere else.</P>
        <P>To be fair, the number of consultants in Drogheda has increased from 31 to 62. Last year, &euro;75 million was spent in that hospital. There are still issues in the hospital and I discussed them last night with the management and the representatives of the medical board. Next week, the national hospitals office will be on site with the management to ensure these recommendations are implemented quickly. There will be no excuse for not implementing the recommendations as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>With regard to the new consultant contract, we need arrangements for clinical governance. It is a fact that some staff knew what was happening at the hospital, which was not appropriate. Some staff complained but their complaints were ignored. We need clinical governance at every level in the hospital. We need to have a clinical director in charge of the surgeons and a clinical director on the medical side so that best practice can be implemented on all occasions. If best practice had been in operation in this case, the tragedy would have been avoided for the women affected. It will be part and parcel of the new consultant contract that consultants will work in teams and not as sole operators, and that they will be responsible to a clinical director who will have overall responsibility.</P>

	<P>A question was not answered. With regard to the women who were not covered by the terms of reference of this report and who, for example, had their ovaries removed or whose babies died, will they be included in the compensation scheme? I take it from what the Minister has said that the women will be paid compensation ahead of any difficulties she may have with regard to insurers or getting the hospital to contribute, and that they will not be left waiting for the negotiations to be completed before they are compensated.</P>

	<P>The Government has not yet approved the compensation scheme but I have indicated my strong support for one, as has the Taoiseach. The women will not be left waiting; they must come first. However, if it is the case that we need legislation to pursue insurers, we can do that at the same time and it should not cause delay. I envisage that the State would pay the compensation and would then seek to recoup it. That is what I have discussed with my officials and with regard to the legal advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report focused on a particular group of patients. The judge met the women to whom the Deputy referred, as did I.

        <Quest>if she is satisfied with the preparations for avian flu and a possible flu pandemic; the reason D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was not informed about the purchase of a vaccine which was announced through the media; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8740/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied with progress on preparations for a possible flu pandemic and with public health actions in response to a possible outbreak of avian flu in Ireland. The health sector&rsquo;s role in regard to avian flu relates to the human health implications that would arise were there to be an outbreak of avian flu. Guidance on the investigation and management of suspected human cases has therefore been developed and circulated within the health system.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Health Service Executive are working closely on pandemic planning. The influenza pandemic expert group is updating the expert guidance and the pandemic influenza operational response plan is being updated in line with the expert advice. In addition, my Department has established a standing inter<Col N="1987"/>departmental committee to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of a flu pandemic.</P>
        <P>Arrangements have been made to procure a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine for key health care workers and other essential workers and we are stockpiling 1 million treatment packs of the antiviral drug, Tamiflu. Arrangements have also been made to purchase a supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to treat children aged one to five years of age and further arrangements are being finalised for the stockpiling of additional supplies of the other suitable antiviral drug, Relenza.</P>
        <P>I do not understand the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to this House not being informed with regard to the purchase of H5N1 vaccine. On 31 January last, in reply to a parliamentary question, I stated that arrangements to procure a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine for key health care workers and other essential workers were in train. Officials from my Department and the HSE informed the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 16 February of our plans in this regard and the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food was briefed on 25 January. The announcement with regard to the purchase was made last Friday at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I attended the meeting to which the T&aacute;naiste referred and have checked the minutes. No reference was made to the purchase of 400,000 doses of vaccine. Will those 400,000 doses be given on a voluntary basis only? How many people does the T&aacute;naiste expect to use the vaccine? When will the 400,000 doses arrive? Does the T&aacute;naiste agree with the assessment of Dr. Kevin Kelleher, who addressed the Joint Committee on Health and Children, that the health service as it stands probably could not cope with a flu pandemic? Can she confirm that the full stock of antiviral drugs has not yet arrived and probably will not arrive until next September? Can she confirm that a new national emergency plan will not be finalised until the end of the summer, that the plan for dealing with a pandemic has not been updated since 2004 and that hospital isolation units are inadequate and sometimes non-existent? Given all of this, does she agree we cannot face a possible flu pandemic with any degree of real confidence?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I totally disagree. We have shown in recent times, in particular with regard to how the foot and mouth disease was handled, that we are very good, as a country, at handling emerging issues of this kind and can work closely together. Our planning is very much in line with that of the World Health Organisation. We follow its instructions and the 2004 plan is in line with its instructions. The WHO is constantly updating its plans and we do the same. Therefore, it is not correct to say we have no plan. We have a plan, <Col N="1988"/>which is constantly revisited. The new plan will be available this summer.</P>
        <P>The vaccine would be taken on a voluntary basis but it is clear that health care professionals would want to use the vaccine to protect themselves. It has been 40 years since the last pandemic. This morning our national expert, Professor Hall, who is one of the world experts in this area, told me it could be another 40 years until the next pandemic. However, we must be vigilant and cannot be complacent. Therefore, when we are creating stockpiles in Ireland of vaccines, Relenza and Tamiflu, we do so to have enough to cover 40% of the population, which is a higher proportion than in any other European country. Indeed, we have been commended for our proposals.</P>
        <P>In the event of a pandemic, it is undoubted the health system would be under pressure, as it would be in any country. We would have to respond to that pressure and would do so at different levels, in the first instance using Tamiflu, Relenza and the vaccines. We are acquiring these products as quickly as we can. We joined with the UK to access the vaccine because as a small country we do not have much muscle in dealing with the producers of these products. We joined with the UK for a single procurement of the vaccines and I am pleased to acknowledge the support of the UK in allowing us to operate with it. This gave us greater clout in negotiating with the producer of the vaccine, which is not yet available. We also have a sleeping contract for any vaccine that might be manufactured after the strain of the disease is identified, which would not be for four to six months after a pandemic would arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The vaccine to which the T&aacute;naiste referred was discussed at the committee meeting. The T&aacute;naiste referred to 40% coverage. The committee was told there would be 25% coverage. Has it increased in the meantime? The T&aacute;naiste also stated the threat might arise 40 years from now. The committee was clearly told that it is not a question of if, but when. Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that, given that there has been a case of the virus spreading to a mammal in Germany, it will probably not be 40 years hence and that we are dealing with an urgent situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am quoting Professor Hall, who said it was 40 years since the last pandemic and that nobody could say for certain when it will happen, and that it could be 40 years from now. It is not significant that the disease transferred to a cat in Germany. Last year 45 tigers had to be put down in Bangkok zoo because they ate raw, infected chicken &mdash; I stress that it was raw, infected chicken and that it happened a year ago. What happened in Germany is not new.</P>
        <P>The decision to purchase Relenza is new. Together with the vaccine, the use of Relenza will mean that 40% of the population is covered. To <Col N="1989"/>the best of my knowledge, no country is aiming for anywhere near that target and certainly none are going beyond it. We have decided to buy Relenza, an inhaler-type product, which we believe is suitable for certain categories of patients, as well as the Tamiflu in addition to the vaccine for health care and other workers. The H5N1 virus first arose in South-East Asia in 1997. We must be vigilant. I met Professor Hall today and regular meetings of the expert group are held. I recently sat in on a European planning meeting in the event of a pandemic. Among the issues on which we have yet to make decisions is what we should do with schools. Should we advise people to stay at home? Many health care workers are parents and may stay at home with their children, and other major issues remain to be resolved. We are working with other countries to establish clear areas of co-operation and co-ordination in these matters.</P>

	<P>The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the principles contained in the primary care strategy, which provides a template for the reform and development of primary care services. The chief executive officer of the HSE has also emphasised the importance of developing primary care services, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals. This is an important priority of the executive and has my full endorsement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In order to support further implementation of the strategy in 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;16 million has been provided. Of this funding &euro;10 million is to support the establishment of 75 to 100 primary care teams nationally. This will enable the provision of 300 additional front-line personnel to work alongside GPs to provide integrated and accessible services in the community. Work by the HSE to establish these primary care teams is under way. The executive will be targeting the funding so as to provide each local health office of the HSE with the potential to develop up to three primary care teams. The executive hopes to focus where possible on areas of disadvantage and with health inequalities in planning for the establishment of these teams.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;4 million has been provided for the establishment of additional general practitioner training places and &euro;2 million to enhance general practitioner out-of-hours co-operatives. This means that, taking into account development <Col N="1990"/>funding provided since 2002, &euro;28 million will be available in 2006 specifically to support the implementation of the primary care strategy.</P>
        <P>Wider implementation of the primary care strategy will focus on developing new ways of working and of reorganising the resources already available to the health service in line with the service model described in the strategy. This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service and not solely within the primary care system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste announced that 75 to 100 existing care teams nationally would receive funding. If they existed I would expect two or three of them to exist in County Wexford and like the Taoiseach, having gone up every tree in County Wexford, I still do not know where the primary care teams are for County Wexford. Nobody knows what she is talking about. These are phantom primary care teams. This deserves some scrutiny. Many of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s recent announcements come to nothing. Only 7,000 doctor-only medical cards and just over 1,000 of the full medical cards announced have been issued. Rather than making a statement about the &euro;10 million and 300 personnel, I would like to know where they will be and with whom the HSE has consulted. In County Wexford, where I feel I know most of the people, and across the country I have met nobody who has been in discussion with the HSE regarding the existing primary care teams, to which the T&aacute;naiste refers. I would like to see the breakdown of where the 300 personnel are located. They have been announced, but we do not know where they are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously the Deputy is ill informed, as there are three in each local health office. In Dublin we have nine local health offices, which would mean 27 in Dublin. I recently discussed the matter with Dr. Se&aacute;n Maguire who is spearheading the project for the HSE. I believe he is familiar to the Deputy. Perhaps I can ask him to communicate to the Deputy the precise location of the discussions taking place in the Wexford area. The idea is to develop primary care services, which are not just about general practices, but also about supporting general practitioners with other therapists such as physiotherapists, chiropodists and occupational therapists in the community so people can have the range of services at that level to allow a primary care strategy to be rolled out across the country.</P>
        <P>I do not have the details of the location of the 75 to 100 people. However, I am sure if the Deputy speaks with the representative of the HSE he can discover where and who they are. There are three in each local health office. I am not sure how many local health offices Wexford has and whether it is more than one. Dublin has nine.</P>

	<P>Under section 31 of the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive must submit a service plan to the Department of Health and Children within 21 days of the publication of the Estimates. The service plan was submitted in line with this legislation on 8 December 2005. There was a further period of 21 days from its submission to either approve the plan or issue a direction to have it amended. I approved the HSE plan on 22 December 2005.</P>
        <P>Under section 31 of the Health Act 2004, it is my responsibility to &ldquo;ensure that a copy of the approved service plan is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days after the plan is approved&rdquo;. I laid the service plan before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 January.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE was established to bring reform to the health services &mdash; that is not to say it brought reform to the Government. Under the code of practice for State bodies, which the T&aacute;naiste has outlined, the HSE has fulfilled its part. It gave the T&aacute;naiste the service plan, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. When was the service plan placed on the website of the Department of Health and Children? It was extremely difficult to get copies of the plan for someone who was not a Member of the Houses or who did not know a Member of the Houses.</P>
        <P>Why does the service plan contain no targets? We have no idea how many home-help hours or home care packages are expected to be delivered in 2006. We do not know what will happen in primary care. The service plan gives no figures and I would like to know what is happening in this regard. How does the board of the HSE monitor what is happening in its organisation if it is following a service plan without clear targets? An un-audited financial statement based on the service plan must also be published at some stage by the HSE board. I would like to know the figures from which it is working. I have serious con<Col N="1992"/>cern with the transparency of what is happening in the HSE. The T&aacute;naiste should speed up the process of placing these plans in the public domain and she should also review the plan. It is very poor on targets, facts and figures that people can use to see if the HSE is an addition to the health services or just a fob. We need greater accountability in what the HSE is doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made some valid points about the specifics in the plan. The HSE is a new organisation and has only been in existence for 14 months. Rather than the money being broken down along the lines of the old health board regions, I would like to see it broken down along more specific lines. I have communicated this to the HSE and in time that will happen. The plan is available on its website and has been available by e-mail since I approved it. It is one of the specified documents in the Act that is required to be made available to Members of the Oireachtas. I do not know whether that happened. If it did not happen I will ensure it will happen in future.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Perry</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>if the implementation of the European working time directive would be affected by her plans for public-only consultants; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8340/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Implementation of the European working time directive will necessitate the following reductions in the working hours of all doctors: a maximum of 58 hours per week from 1 August 2004; a maximum of 56 hours per week from 1 August 2007; and a maximum of 48 hours per week from 1 August 2009.</P>
        <P>The national task force on medical staffing was charged with examining how this directive could be implemented without adversely affecting service delivery. Against the background of the required decrease in non-consultant hospital doctor working hours, the task force recommended the introduction of a consultant-provided service and an increase in the number of consultants. These recommendations are being advanced within the context of the HSE-led negotiations on a new consultants&rsquo; contract. The issue of public-only consultants is also being advanced in those talks. It is intended that as part of a consultant-provided service, such consultants will be remunerated exclusively on a salaried basis, that is, they will not receive additional remuneration for treatment delivered to private patients.</P>
        <P>The new public-only consultant contract will help support the implementation of the directive and will improve patient access to care and ensure better delivery of health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support what the T&aacute;naiste is doing regarding public-only contracts, but the European working time directive must be teased <Col N="1993"/>out. We must fill people in. Neither the T&aacute;naiste nor I can wait either the ten or the 25 years mentioned to get working health services. Do we need a new consultants&rsquo; contract that includes the present consultants? Do we need a new work regime for junior doctors to be brought in more urgently? As the T&aacute;naiste pointed out on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, if the present batch of consultants does not join in a new contract, we will be stuck with the current system for 25 years. Will we find ourselves trying to piggyback two systems, the public-only consultants and the existing ones, along with work practices regarding junior doctors?</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>That essentially makes it quite clear that the European working time directive will be at least a decade behind before we gain any control over this. The public service cannot wait for that. It has nothing to do with the Hanly report but with getting a health service to patients in their communities. In some respects, the T&aacute;naiste has made the mistake as witnessed in many statements made in this regard. She is selling the concept of what one does with the consultants as a progressive move. I am very concerned at what will happen with the European working time directive. If the hours are cut for any reason, for example, because someone takes a court case, might we not run into massive problems in the health service? Does the T&aacute;naiste have any contingency plans for that case?</P>
        <P>I have asked the T&aacute;naiste before whether we have some mechanism to get consultants on public-only contracts into the system quickly. All that I see happening is that we are in a situation, and I would like to know what contingency plans the T&aacute;naiste has if the European working time directive fails. Will we go back to the EU or do we have an emergency plan? If we do not, patient safety and care and the delivery of health services to them will collapse very quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding negotiations under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, with non-consultant hospital doctors, I understand that good progress has been made. On the wider contract issue, we clearly wish to shrink the number of non-consultant hospital doctors and increase the number of consultants. I have received a very favourable reaction from many consultants to the concept of a public-only contract. I have met an amazing number of people who have said that they thought it a very good idea. Quite a number of category one consultants in particular may well opt for that contract.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, consultants are unhappy because of two issues, one being to do with pricing the new contract through the review group on higher pay on the same basis as other public service jobs. They want it priced through the talks process and negotiation. The other issue on which there is dispute is the decision of the HSE board <Col N="1994"/>to stop appointing category two consultants who can work on several different hospital sites, something not very satisfactory from a patient or hospital perspective.</P>
        <P>We urgently need the new contract in place. I intend for it to have a five-year review clause or something of that kind. Our having a current contract or contracts with no review clauses puts the State and health service in a very vulnerable position. As I said, that contract is clearly for their working lives, but either side could break it. However, there would be financial consequences in doing so. It would be better if we could negotiate a new contract. I certainly hope that we can introduce new consultants to the Irish health care system on a public-only contract very soon.</P>
        <P>I was recently in Canada regarding cancer services and met quite a few excellent Irish doctors heading services there. There is a great deal of Irish expertise overseas that I would love to attract back to our health care system. Many of them would return if we could provide an appropriate contract of employment and substantially increase the numbers of people in different areas.</P>

	<P>I wanted to come in on that last point. Under the European working time directive, there is a clear need to ensure more consultants in the system. In line with what Deputy Twomey has already put to the T&aacute;naiste, can she outline to us what steps she is now taking and what further measures she is considering to ensure greater throughput, not only regarding indigenously trained staff from whatever community, but also regarding ensuring that they remain in the system? Every citizen is paying for the process. We are not paying for them to go off and take their skills elsewhere. There is massive investment on the part of every taxpayer in this State.</P>
        <P>We are losing people at an inordinate rate. What steps will the T&aacute;naiste take to ensure that people remain in the system here? We must gear matters towards that. It must be attractive, and that is not only a matter of money but a raft of different things that affect the conditions of employment. We must make it attractive for people to stay.</P>
        <P>I agree with the T&aacute;naiste that the Canadian system is very interesting since it is open to all on the basis of need and free at the point of delivery, excepting only a very small number of services not provided through the national health system. Along with other experiences, it is well worth considering in formulating a new health care system in our own jurisdiction. I would like to know the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response and what she is now doing to attract back some of those whom we have already lost.</P>

	<P>Recently, Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown won approval for seven new consultants to implement what we are attempting through the contract discussions, including team working. Almost all of them are Irish people who have returned from positions in the US, which is very encouraging. I very much agree with the Deputy that it is not all about the salary. It is also about working conditions. It is not just the facilities but such matters as protected time for education, training and research, clinical governance issues and back-up facilities. Many consultants have said to me that they returned, got a job and found themselves virtually on their own without any secretarial or information technology back-up.</P>
        <P>It is a range of factors and in Canada, one thing I found very attractive was that after six years one can have a six-month sabbatical to conduct research or attend training. Many consultants there find that very tempting. Others may feel that after the age of 55 they do not want to do night or weekend work. We need a flexible contract of employment that attracts and keeps the best. In particular, we must double the numbers we have. That will make the system very appealing. However, we could not possibly begin to do that on the current contract, which is very unsatisfactory from the perspective of the patient and the health system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 62 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the European working time directive as it relates to the working hours of doctors in training came into force on 1 August 2004. The relevant provisions were transposed into Irish law by way of the European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004. That will ultimately reduce non-consultant hospital doctors&rsquo; working hours to an average of 48 hours per week. The introduction of new rosters in <Col N="1996"/>many sites would facilitate significant progress towards compliance with the directive while maintaining safe patient care and existing levels of service provision.</P>
        <P>Employers and the Irish Medical Organisation have been engaged in discussions for some time under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission to advance proposals to effect a reduction in the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors. The LRC however, has requested that both parties refrain from engaging in any form of unilateral action for the duration of the negotiation process. Consequently, health employers are at present awaiting agreement between management and the IMO at national level before proceeding with the introduction of these rosters. On 7 February 2005, both sides accepted a proposal made by the LRC to establish a national implementation group. This group co-ordinates the work of local implementation groups in nine pilot sites, issues agreed guidance on matters related to the implementation of the European working time directive and assists in the development of local implementation plans.</P>
        <P>Each local implementation group includes consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors, nurses and management. These groups have drawn up pilot projects to try to find viable solutions to the difficult issue of reducing hospital doctors&rsquo; hours. Suggested projects have been brought before the national implementation group for consideration. It is expected that many of the suggested projects will be up and running in the near future, with the full backing of all of the stakeholders.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The data gathered from this exercise will help to determine how we begin to reorganise services over a 24-hour day to maintain high quality patient care while achieving compliance with the directive.</P>
        <P>Service in our hospitals has not been adversely affected by the implementation of the working time directive. I am confident the implementation of this directive, and the introduction of new non-consultant hospital doctors and consultant contracts, will greatly improve service provision generally and hospital care in particular.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Twelve years after this directive was first mooted, we will now get nine pilot schemes which will not even reduce the non-consultant hospital doctors&rsquo; hours to the level expected by 2004. Hence, in order to reduce Members&rsquo; concerns about the impact on the health service in the coming years, what is planned? The T&aacute;naiste mentioned Canada. If we want to establish a consultant-led service, how many Irish graduates are available to return? Does she have any plans to instigate measures similar to those used for decentralisation, that is, <Col N="1997"/>to go worldwide in an attempt to gauge how many people might be available? This could even include junior doctors, who are engaged at present in the discussions regarding the European working time directive. How many people might wish to return to Ireland as consultants? It would be useful to know what specialties are available, so we could gauge whether it will be possible to move to a consultant-led service within the next two to three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have an answer to Deputy Twomey&rsquo;s question, unless one takes into account the experience in respect of the seven recent consultant appointments in Blanchardstown. I understand all the appointees came from overseas, mainly from the United States. There are many Irish doctors in the United States, Canada and other countries and many of them might be attracted home. However, much would depend on the new contract of employment as well as the consultants&rsquo; possible locations. Clearly, the reduction in working hours for the non-consultant hospital doctors will only be successful when they are replaced by consultant-led services. We will then have an appropriate system of health care delivery. One cannot have one without the other, and the sooner we can begin to recruit such consultants, the better.</P>
        <P>This is particularly true if we want to provide facilities at a regional level. For example, some regions have no plastic surgeon, possibly only one dermatologist, as well as significant gaps in rheumatology. Until we secure a better contract of employment which is more cost-effective from the health system&rsquo;s perspective, we will be unable to substantially increase the numbers of consultants. The two go hand in hand and I hope the negotiations can be concluded quickly.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Information provided by the Health Service Executive indicates that the total cost to the State of introducing free influenza vaccinations for the entire population would be more than &euro;160 million a year, based on certain assumptions about the cost of the vaccine and GP fees.</P>
        <P>However, vaccination for the entire population against seasonal influenza is not currently recommended and there would be serious questions about the cost effectiveness of such an approach.</P>
        <P>Currently, the seasonal influenza vaccine is available free of charge from general practitioners to medical card holders and holders of GP visit cards who are deemed to be at risk of serious illness as a result of contracting the dis<Col N="1998"/>ease. While persons in the at-risk group who do not have a medical card or a GP visit card can obtain the vaccine free of charge, the fee for administering the vaccine in such cases is a matter between the general practitioner and the patient. The at-risk groups include persons aged 65 years or older, those with specific chronic illness such as chronic heart, lung or kidney disease, and those with a suppressed immune system.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The question of extending the immunisation categories is kept under review by the national immunisation advisory committee.</P>

	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her reply. What is the uptake among the at-risk group to which she referred?

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the WHO recommends there should be an uptake of 75% among the at-risk groups. It recommends that this target should be achieved by 2010. I am sorry not to have uptake figures and I will try to acquire them for the Deputy. I also lack data pertaining to adverse effects. While I am told the vaccine is effective in up to 90% of cases, I do not know what the adverse effects might be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of any significant adverse effects. Those who are between 66 and 70 years&rsquo; old and who are above the medical card threshold find that it is the luck of the draw as to whether their doctor charges them. Some are deterred from getting the flu vaccine because their doctors sometimes charge them the full amount. Surely the Minister accepts that it would actually be cost-effective to ensure that the group in question can have the flu vaccine free? I mean both the vaccine and the doctor&rsquo;s visit. Does she not appreciate that in terms of protecting accident and emergency units from overuse, it would be helpful to permit those who are 66 years old and older people to avail of the flu vaccine without being obliged to incur any cost?</P>

	<P>My question concerns the free flu vaccine which has already been offered to those in the poultry sector. This was an initiative launched by the T&aacute;naiste before Christmas. What level of proactivity was <Col N="1999"/>employed by the Department in promoting its uptake by those who are involved in the poultry sector and their families, as well as by those numerous categories of people who were listed in response to a question I raised on the Adjournment in this regard? If I remember correctly, the question was taken by the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue. Can the T&aacute;naiste advise on the uptake by those involved in the poultry sector? Was a particular effort employed in those areas of the State in which poultry farming constitutes a significant part of the local agricultural practice? These are extremely important points because, as Members are aware, if avian flu presents, it is critically important to prevent it mixing with traditional flu, thus creating a new pandemic. This is a possibility and the risk is even greater than when I first asked these questions. Can the T&aacute;naiste provide the House with an update in this respect?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not in a position to give Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in an update. As for the cost of extending free vaccinations to the group referred to by Deputy McManus, as we have seen in respect of the over-70s medical card, if one announces that something will be made available to a class of citizen by virtue of the class rather than on the basis of economic circumstances, one ends up paying substantially more for it. However, if it were to be paid for on the basis of the current free scheme, it would probably cost approximately &euro;20 million. The vaccine costs &euro;4.45 per dose and there would be a medical fee of &euro;34.43.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good value and is worth doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We might give consideration to the measure, especially if we could deliver it at a cost of &euro;19 million. However, I suspect that were we to take such an approach, it would cost much more to include the group in question. Clearly, our aim is to have a 70% uptake among the at-risk group by 2010, which has great benefits. Members are all aware, from their experiences with elderly people, that those who receive the flu vaccine are less likely to encounter winter complications. It is highly successful.</P>

        <Quest>the procedures which are <Col N="2000"/>in place to protect patients and visitors to hospitals under the health and safety regulations; if her Department has had discussions with the health and safety authority regarding the possible exposure to litigation by patients or visitors under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 if they feel they have been exposed to hazards by the action of Health Service Executive employees; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>All employers, including the Health Service Executive and hospitals, are obliged to adhere to the requirements set out in health and safety legislation and to ensure the safety, health and welfare of their staff. Hospitals must also ensure that patients and visitors are not exposed to risks to their safety, health and welfare.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under existing legislation any hazards must be risk assessed and appropriate control measures put in place to eliminate the hazard or, where this is not possible, reduce it as far as reasonably practicable. It is also open to the Health and Safety Authority to make the necessary inquiries or carry out such inspections as it deems necessary to verify the compliance of any employer with existing legislation.</P>
        <P>In 2005 the HSA wrote to the chief executives of all hospitals with A&amp;E departments. This letter required the hospital chief executives to ensure that a comprehensive written risk assessment was prepared, in accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act. The Health and Safety Authority has urged all those working in hospitals to have due regard for their own safety and that of others and to liaise with their safety representative and management to ensure all risks have been addressed. The national hospitals office of the Health Service Executive has in place a standard operating procedure for risk assessment in A&amp;E units. This procedure deals with any hazard that could cause harm to staff, patients, clients or visitors occurring at any time and in any location within A&amp;E units.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is responsible for implementing procedures to protect employees, patients and visitors to hospitals under all the health and safety legislation. I understand that in 2006 the Health and Safety Authority is continuing its work relating to the potential risks to safety, health and welfare of hospital workers and has written to the Health Service Executive recently in this regard. There are obvious synergies between employee health and safety and patient safety. The issues involved cut across a number of agencies including the Health Service Executive, Health and Safety Authority and possibly the health and information and quality authority, HIQA, when it is established. My Department will have a role in ensuring a coherent <Col N="2001"/>approach has been taken at a national level by the various public agencies involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This refers to a recent parliamentary question which stated the Health and Safety Authority is focusing on the existence and implementation of a comprehensive infection control policy. I seek a bit of background on this. What we are focusing on here is the significant increase in cases of MRSA, the increase in cases of tuberculosis &mdash; a recent report stated there were 300 cases in Dublin alone &mdash; and the increase in cases of hepatitis B. While we have identified there is a problem to some to degree, has the HSE any plans to help hospitals, nursing homes and other care settings to draw up these site-specific risk assessments for their institutions and to identify and correct the problems because the road the HSA is going will either close these institutions or expose them to massive amounts of litigation?</P>
        <P>We know the biological agents within the health service that have gone out of control. We are not talking only about the baseline hospital acquired infections but about how they have gone out of control. Apart from the hygiene audit, has the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children any plans in place to assist facilities within the health service to draw up these risk assessments and to give the resources to correct the difficulties identified? For example, a decade ago hospitals stopped swabbing hospital workers to see if they had MRSA and therefore workers and patients have been probably more exposed to MRSA. I want to know what progress she has made in moving this matter of hygiene on a little.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>First, by way of clarification, there is no outbreak of tuberculosis. The report mentioned in newspapers today is three years old and the figures mentioned are for a five-year period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recently communicated with Professor Drumm on MRSA in hospitals and on informing patients and putting strategies in place. It is the intention of the HSE &mdash; it is currently doing this in some cases &mdash; to work with hospitals one by one on the issues that arose in hygiene. Of course hygiene has a part to play and hand-washing has a part to play, and so too has appropriate prescribing of antibiotics and isolation facilities. A host of issues arise. The intention is that the HSE will work with the hospitals on these issues.</P>
        <P>This morning Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked me about visiting hours. It is not a matter for me to decide hospital visiting hours and we certainly will not introduce legislation in that regard, but the best hospitals in the world restrict visiting, except in the case of terminally or seriously ill patients where clearly one would want their families to have access. Many hospital employees, and indeed patients I know from my circle of friends and acquaintances, have told me that if <Col N="2002"/>one is sharing a room with others in hospital and there are visitors constantly in the ward, it is difficult to get the required rest. The more we can control visiting times in hospitals, the better. In addition to the issues for staff and patients, there are also significant issues from a hygiene perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the reference by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the earlier question I put to her. While that may be the experience in the circle of acquaintances to whom she has spoken, would she recognise that others may have a very different experience and that the visiting opportunities of people is an integral part of the curative process of those who are ill and hospitalised? Real concerns are being expressed, particularly, in the cases I have noted, by family of older long-stay patients. This is causing great concern.</P>
        <P>There is every argument for particular straightening of visiting opportunities but restrictive curtailment on the back of the MRSA issue &mdash; the two are linked &mdash; suggests that visitors were the cause or the most significant contributing factor to the presence of MRSA in hospitals. That is not the case, and it is dumping on visitors. Visitors are an integral part of the address of any illness that a hospital patient may present with. It is simply not acceptable to look to that as the panacea for MRSA or to distract from the other major contributory causes such as the standards of cleanliness, upkeep and maintenance. I appeal to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to look again at this. It is the wrong course to take.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children mentioned the necessity for isolation units. Would she agree with the assessment of Dr. Sam McConkey, an infectious disease consultant at Beaumont Hospital, that the facilities are just not adequate? Can she comment on the fact that two of Dublin&rsquo;s biggest hospitals, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital, have no isolation units at all?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not familiar with Dr.<?oasys _jy ?>McConkey&rsquo;s observations. First, to refer to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s comments, of course I am not suggesting there would not be any visiting but it is unreasonable to have virtually open door visiting from maybe 10 a.m., and sometimes earlier, until 10 p.m. That is difficult for staff but particularly for patients. Certainly in places where patients are sharing rooms, it is extraordinarily difficult.</P>
        <P>Policy on patients differs. I remember as a child being in hospital and my parents were told not to come and see me until the end of the treatment, and apparently they looked in the window. Nowadays parents are encouraged to come and stay <Col N="2003"/>with the children. In the period since I was born the position has changed.</P>

	<P>I had a similar experience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Policies change. The new paediatric facilities must provide for parents to stay with the children. Policies change in this area all the time.</P>
        <P>Certainly I am told by many people at hospital level, and I know from patients, that there can be difficulties if there is open access. Confining visiting times to particular hours, if that is possible, is in everybody&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clearly we must do more about isolation facilities. They say the hospital of the future will have single rooms. One can imagine the cost, both in terms of the provision of hospitals of that kind and of the staff implications of such hospitals. I understand that will be the global norm a number of years from now for issues to do with infection and appropriate patient treatment. We are providing increased isolation facilities in new facilities being built and that must be the norm in new facilities.</P>

Additional funding of &euro;3 million has been made available to the Health Service Executive to support the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. The strategic planning and reform implementation of the HSE have approved the following projects to take place this year: expanding the healthy food made easy programme, recruiting four physical activity officers <Col N="2004"/>to target obesity in all settings, providing four specialist community dietician posts for obesity and weight management to support all initiatives, the procurement of equipment for growth monitoring and further progress work with the food service sector on healthy food provision. The HSE has confirmed that additional resources will be allocated to obesity services in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital during 2006. In 2006, the executive will spend approximately &euro;25 million on health promotion, of which approximately &euro;5 million per annum will be spent on measures to prevent obesity. In addition, much of the work of hospital and community dieticians is concerned with the treatment of obesity.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but he did not address my concerns about the obesity clinic in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital. I presume he has read the statement on his Department&rsquo;s website that 2,500 deaths per year are caused by obesity while a total of 30 people on waiting lists to access treatment die annually. The most recent figure for the waiting list for the obesity clinic in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital is 500. The Minister of State glided over information I sought. Food campaigns are all very well but I asked about a specific obesity clinic and he has replied that the HSE will provide resources. How much? When? In what form?</P>

	<P>The Deputy is the expert on lecturing in the House. She has asked a question and, if she will allow me, I will answer. In recognising the seriousness of the problem, we put in place a task force. It reported last May and, at the end of the year, I announced that, apart from the normal expenditure on obesity programmes, I would provide an additional &euro;3 million to tackle the obesity problem. St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital will get some of this money. I cannot give the Deputy a breakdown of how the money will be spent but I will make inquiries and come back to her.</P>
        <P>The task force report contained 93 recommendations, of which 24 relate to the health service. Many other areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We are implementing a number of them. A number of initiatives were in place and we are expanding them. We will also implement other initiatives during the year. The <Col N="2005"/>provision of an additional &euro;3 million demonstrates how serious we are about tackling the problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State promised he would answer the questions I asked and he has not done so. He stated in his original reply that resources would be invested in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital. How much and for what purpose?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">I would love to move on the next question, which addresses the &euro;40 million spent on the development plan for the Mater Misericordiae Hospital before it was terminated but I must refer to this issue. There was a significant row earlier about the poor quality of replies to parliamentary questions referred to the HSE. It is a cause of huge concern for Opposition Members. This question is clear. What steps will be taken to aid St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital? I am surprised the Minister of State would come into the House and tell Deputy McManus that he will reply to her question at a later date. This is Question No. 11, not No. 44, and it is not as if for some reason we have failed to reach it. I expect an answer regarding how much the hospital will receive or whether it will be given an extra dietician or consultant or more junior doctors. That information should have been provided.</P>

      <sTitle>Voluntary Housing.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Mr. &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter. Voluntary housing has been one of the success stories of the past decade and it is an area of activity with which I am proud to have been involved. We are living in a protracted period of unprecedented levels of housing construction and it is important not to lose sight of the important role played by the voluntary sector. More than 600 approved voluntary bodies manage almost 19,000 housing units under the capital assistance programme and the capital loan and rental subsidy schemes. The capital assistance scheme has been used to great advantage in providing for specialised housing such as sheltered housing and housing for those with special needs, the elderly and so on.</P>
        <P>For the most part, the capital loan and rental subsidy scheme is used to address demand in the area of mainstream social housing accommodation. Voluntary housing associations have been established in every county and communities are benefiting from their endeavours. The varied nature of the bodies approved by the Department is interesting, ranging in scale from local conferences of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or local community councils providing and managing a handful of properties to large associations such as Respond, which has delivered and is managing almost 3,500 units. It is important that Members should recognise, acknowledge and value the contribution of the sector not just to housing provision, but to community building.</P>
        <P>I refer to two areas of concern for tenants of properties provided under the capital loan and rental subsidy scheme, namely the need to adjust the rent scheme where it applies at 18% of all household income and the need to introduce a tenant purchase scheme, similar to that available <Col N="2007"/>to local authority tenants. I have engaged with the Minister of State on this on previous occasions. In raising these issues, I am conscious of a number of relevant points, not least that in many areas, integrated housing developments on the same site are coming on stream involving the local authority, voluntary and private sectors. In addition, a number of councils are engaging the services of voluntary housing associations to deliver their own social housing programmes. Against this background it is important to recognise that those on local authority waiting lists who avail of tenancies from voluntary housing associations do so of necessity rather than by preference in the great majority of cases. If they do not avail of the voluntary association offer, they may often be left waiting indefinitely by their local authority. Consequently, tenants of an approved housing body may live next door, in an identical house, to a tenant of a local authority. Both originated from the same local authority waiting list and both houses are 100% funded by the Exchequer. More often than not, however, the tenant of the voluntary housing association pays a higher rent, as the scheme is fixed at 18% of household income whereas the differential schemes operated by local authorities tend to be more favourable to the tenants of council houses. For example, tenants of the Cill Urna&iacute; housing association at Kilberry outside Athy pay 18% of their household income, whereas tenants of Athy Town Council, just down the road, avail of the differential rent scheme where the rent is based on 15% of the principal earner&rsquo;s income. This is hardly fair. It is something I hope the Minister can review.</P>
        <P>The same principle of equity should apply in the area of tenant purchase. Take what has happened at Monasterevin in County Kildare for example. Here, the local voluntary housing association constructed an estate of 28 houses. Twenty of these houses were to be occupied by members of the association, namely, people who had come together some years previously to build the housing scheme with the active support of local community activists. These 20 prospective tenants had an on-going involvement in all aspects of the housing project. When the houses were complete, eight were allocated to tenants of Kildare County Council which subsequently allocated the houses to families from its waiting list, the same list from which the 20 voluntary members came originally.</P>
        <P>Despite being involved from the start in the development of the housing scheme, the voluntary housing association tenants cannot avail of a purchase scheme, while their neighbouring council tenants can. To put it more bluntly, those who have used the capital loan and rental subsidy scheme as a self-help initiative have found them<Col N="2008"/>selves disadvantaged. This is unfair and unjust and requires attention.</P>
        <P>While some of the larger voluntary housing associations oppose in principle the concept of a purchase scheme, we must remember that there was once a lobby which opposed the sale of council houses to their tenants. The introduction of a tenant purchase scheme would unleash a new dynamic in the voluntary sector and encourage an even greater level of provision. I urge the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l for raising this matter and I welcome the opportunity to outline the ongoing development of the voluntary housing sector and discuss the need to introduce a tenant purchase option. I know of the Deputy&rsquo;s interest and involvement in the voluntary sector and his deep commitment to it.</P>
        <P>The provision of social housing by the sector is funded under two separate voluntary housing schemes, the capital assistance scheme providing special needs housing and the capital loan and subsidy scheme which provides family type accommodation. Approved bodies work in partnership with the relevant local authority in providing social rental accommodation. Support for the development of the voluntary and co-operative sector is being continued and this is reflected by the recently increased funding limits I announced and the new arrangements for the sector under consideration.</P>
        <P>The capital loan and subsidy scheme is, for the most part, used to fund family type social housing. Rental income is used to defray the cost of management and maintenance and for the provision of a sinking fund to cater for more extensive refurbishment later in the lifetime of a project. Under the terms of the scheme, approved housing bodies are responsible for determining the rent payable by a tenant which is based on household and subsidiary income in the previous tax year. Approved bodies, however, have at their discretion flexibility to modify the application of the rents scheme.</P>
        <P>Since the introduction of the capital loan and subsidy scheme in 1991 it has been considered that the sale of individual housing units could undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs. There are incentives for residents of more than one year&rsquo;s duration who wish to move on and become homeowners elsewhere, but this is not what the Deputy has in mind.</P>
        <P>To have maximum impact and to make our housing policy more relevant, the Department published a policy framework document just before Christmas entitled Housing Policy Frame<Col N="2009"/>work &mdash; Building Sustainable Communities. In that document it is proposed that consideration would be given, in consultation with the voluntary and co-operative sector, to pilot a tenant purchase scheme for some new voluntary homes under the scheme. As well as expanding the investment programme, the Government will implement a programme of reforms, aimed at improving service and ensuring that social housing is delivered in a way that is fair and efficient. The reforms, including bringing forward the necessary legislation, will involve implementation of a fair rents policy across all social housing tenures.</P>
        <P>I have listened to the Deputy and have discussed the matter with him previously. We have brought forward our housing policy framework and are fleshing it out. Later this year we expect to announce a more detailed new housing policy. I have heard what the Deputy wants and suggests and other Members would like to see a tenant purchase scheme in the voluntary sector. We have announced we will do it on a pilot basis for some new schemes and are continuing discussions with the sector. I will examine the Deputy&rsquo;s request and see if we can move forward when we produce our policy document later in the year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I sought this Adjournment debate on learning of the revelations in a study that shows a significant increase in TB infection in parts of Dublin. This has been highlighted and has caused serious concern. The increase shows the inadequate hospital treatment provision for TB patients in the wake of the grossly irresponsible closure of the chest and respiratory unit, commonly known as the TB unit, at Peamount Hospital. The Government facilitated that closure. There is an urgent need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to outline the measures she will introduce to address this threat to public health.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to the study carried out by Dr. Margaret Hannan, consultant clinical microbiologist at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, young working Irish men are increasingly at risk of contracting TB. The research looked at all of north Dublin and found evidence that people who had recently picked up the infection were young Irish-born males who were in employment and living in urban parts of Dublin. Margaret Hannan stated: &ldquo;One of the things we found was that they were all living in certain areas and all drinking in certain pubs. That is indicative of poor TB control in the country and that could be the beginning of an epidemic outbreak.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>There were 437 cases of TB provisionally notified in 2004. In 2003, 407 cases were notified and the figure for 2002 was 400. This is a very worrying trend and this is underlined by this latest study. Dr. Hannan has warned that there is a <Col N="2010"/>danger of an epidemic outbreak if urgent steps are not taken to control the disease. She says there is poor infrastructure in Ireland for the management, control and prevention of TB. She also said: &ldquo;The closure of Peamount has taken away a service that was essential.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>When the threat to close the TB unit at Peamount first arose, I wrote to the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">I write to convey my concern at the decision of the Board of Peamount Hospital to discontinue Chest/Respiratory Services. I understand that it is intended that all chest hospital activity will cease from January 2004 and the services will be transferred to St. James Hospital.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">You will already be aware that there is grave concern among staff and patients at the proposal to close the long-established and specialised TB ward at St. Ita&rsquo;s, Peamount. I have received very worrying representations from nurses&rsquo; representatives and from a patient at Peamount. I believe they show clearly the excellent work done in this unit over many years and continuing to this day. There is particular concern that the special care provided to more vulnerable TB patients in Peamount could not be provided if the service is moved to St. James&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I believe that this is not just a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority but, given the central role of Peamount in the treatment of TB in Ireland, is of national importance. Therefore I urge you to intervene directly to have the decision to cease Chest/Respiratory Services at Peamount reversed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague did not intervene and the unit at Peamount was allowed to close. The promised facilities at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital have not materialised and now we have a study showing an increased threat from tuberculosis. There is concern internationally at new and more virulent strains of tuberculosis. This is a very worrying situation and we are less well equipped today to deal with it than we were three years ago. I call on the Minister responsible to restore the unit at Peamount and to provide a national action plan to combat tuberculosis.</P>

        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has called upon the Minister to act but she would have to embark on consultations with the Health Service Executive to address the issue. The Department has not, as yet, received the report referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. The Minister has asked the Health Service Executive to furnish a copy and it will be examined by the chief medical officer of the Depart<Col N="2011"/>ment upon receipt. However, I understand from the executive that the data used in the report referred to by the Deputy is a number of years old. I and the Health Service Executive would like to reassure the public that there is no outbreak of tuberculosis in the north inner city area of Dublin and that there are no major concerns in this regard.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The Health Act 1947 and the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981, as amended, provide the legislative basis for the control of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, in Ireland. The Department&rsquo;s strategy in the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis is guided by the recommendations of the report of the working party on tuberculosis, published in 1996, which covers a wide range of issues, including epidemiology, surveillance, screening, preventative therapy, clinical management and laboratory diagnosis. Responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations rests with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The future organisation and delivery of respiratory and tuberculosis services was examined by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in a report published in July 2000. This report found that, in line with major advances in medical treatment, the optimal inpatient care of patients with respiratory diseases, including tuberculosis, is more appropriate to acute general hospitals, staffed by consultant respiratory physicians and other consultants and supported by an array of investigative facilities. While recognising the valuable role which Peamount Hospital had played for many years in the delivery of respiratory services, Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al did not regard it as an appropriate location for the future treatment of tuberculosis patients, especially those requiring ventilation and specialised treatment for other illnesses, for example heart disease, HIV and so forth.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al subsequently appointed a committee to advise on the implementation of the 2000 report. The report of this committee endorsed the recommendations in the 2000 report and it was adopted by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in April 2003. Specifically, the committee recommended that Peamount Hospital should play an active role in the provision of a range of non-acute support services, including pulmonary rehabilitation, within the Health Service Executive south-western area. For example, it recommended that patients who have been treated in the nearby St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and other major acute hospitals and who require ongoing rehabilitative care could be transferred to Peamount Hospital for completion of their care. In addition, three specialist tuberculosis beds for multi-resistant and complex tuberculosis patients are due to open in the coming weeks in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P><Col N="2012"/>
        <P>The Health Service Executive eastern regional area established a working group on tuberculosis services in the eastern region and respiratory services in the Health Service Executive south-western area. The group examined the options for the future management of tuberculosis, both acute and non-acute, in the eastern region. It also addressed and identified other respiratory services that might be appropriately delivered in Peamount Hospital, taking account of best practice. The group consisted of a respiratory physician, a specialist nurse and the director of nursing from Peamount, a management representative from the hospital, general practitioners, a public health specialist and an accident and emergency representative. The group reported to the Health Service Executive eastern region in early 2005. It endorsed the recommendations of the working party report of 1996 and the subsequent Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Having raised the issue of Peamount Hospital on a number of occasions, this report needs to be examined in detail because there is an issue regarding the treatment of chronic, recurrent sufferers of tuberculosis as opposed to those who would tend to present in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital. However, there are a number of national issues of concern and I have given a commitment to raise a different one.</P>
        <P>I ask the Ministers of State, Deputies Killeen and Brian Lenihan, to urge the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to arrange for an audit of every domestic gas installation in the country, particularly those connected by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, at least from the meter to the house. That might sound like a massive undertaking but if it is not done, the Government could be guilty of failing to prevent unnecessary gas explosions which could occur anywhere in a grotesque lottery of death. Information has been brought to my attention in this regard and I would like to see immediate action.</P>
        <P>Just over a year ago, on 3 February 2005, I highlighted the issue of the certification of people who install natural gas systems and the need to have accredited professionals working in this area. I referred to issues regarding the types of flux used, some of which corrode gas pipes, and the need for people working with such material to know exactly what they are doing. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in his reply, promised that an energy miscellaneous provisions Bill would be published and the matters raised would be dealt with in that context.</P>
        <P>In reply to parliamentary questions I tabled, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, indi<Col N="2013"/>cated that the new legislation would provide for a scheme of regulation specifically aimed at gas installers. Such a scheme is supposed to ensure that all future work on natural gas fittings will conform to the appropriate standards and make it unlawful for any person who is not a certified natural gas installer to work on a natural gas fitting. We still await that legislation and I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to bring it forward at the earliest opportunity. However, I will take their word in good faith that they will deal with the matters I raised previously.</P>
        <P>There is now a more pressing issue with regard to natural gas installations. I contend, having spoken to a number of experts in this field, that there is an urgent need to carry out an audit of our domestic gas network to ensure that pipe work and other equipment adheres to the highest international standards, that a proper certification system is in place for the people installing and repairing gas systems and, most importantly, that the clear and present risk to residents using natural gas is minimised before an avoidable tragedy occurs owing to defective equipment being installed in many homes. Defective equipment has been installed in many homes.</P>
        <P>In my constituency one of the fastest growing towns in the country, Lucan, has tens of thousands of new dwellings. In Dublin Mid-West, including Lucan and Clondalkin, there are tranches of new houses, all of which had gas systems installed, generally just after the houses were purchased. Until recently, the body responsible for connecting the gas was Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann. Now I believe, and the Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong, private contractors are doing this work, which removes liability from Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann but does not remove the issues related to safety.</P>
        <P>For the tens, if not hundreds of thousands of installations connected by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann over the years an issue has come to light with regard to the insulation of the gas pipe work, even that small section going from the meter to the house. If even one inch of gas pipe work is left exposed, without insulation but under concrete, it will corrode over time. Concrete is a highly corrosive material and if the pipe corrodes, the gas will travel out the quickest way possible. Sometimes it will go into the house, other times it will travel up sewage pipes. The nature of gas is such that it needs to rise to the surface and when gas builds up to certain levels, at a given temperature and within a specific space, it can lead to an explosion.</P>
        <P>There are a large number of gas pipe work installations that are not properly insulated because they have been done shoddily. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is responsible for this, as are the building contractors. I have a number of documents, one <Col N="2014"/>of which indicates non-conformance for a gas pipe to a gas fire, with the pipe not protected against corrosion. I have another user safety notice for a gas pipe where the meter entering the house is not protected against corrosion. These are just examples of tens of thousands of installations throughout the country that are not protected against corrosion. If only one of those houses has a gas leak because of this corrosion and it leads to an explosion that kills one person, that is one person too many. Every installation, particularly from the meter to the house and possibly inside the house, where appropriate, needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency before someone dies as a result of negligence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter. I fully appreciate Deputy Gogarty&rsquo;s motivation for raising this issue, as the safety of domestic natural gas consumers and the public in general is of paramount importance. However, the Minister has been advised by the Department&rsquo;s chief technical adviser and by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann that as the pipeline contains gas not a liquid, there is no requirement for thermal insulation on any pipework from the meter to the house. The Minister has been advised that the lack of insulation has no implications for the safety of installations.</P>
        <P>Having said that, the Minister wholeheartedly agrees that it is necessary that we as legislators and public representatives ensure that safety is placed high on the political agenda. In that context, I advise Deputies that the Government has this week approved the publication and initiation in this House of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006. Among the provisions of the Bill are, <i>inter alia,</i> expanding the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation to include: the regulation of the activities of natural gas undertakings and natural gas installers, with respect to safety; the promotion of natural gas safety; consultation with the National Standards Authority of Ireland regarding gas safety standards; and the establishment and implementation of a natural gas safety framework.</P>
        <P>The natural gas safety provisions will empower the Commission for Energy Regulation to direct natural gas undertakings to advise their customers and the public as to natural gas safety and regulate the standards of training of gas installers in regard to gas safety. The Minister looks forward to the support of Deputies in bringing the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to enactment when introduced to the House.</P>
        <P>I will detail, for the benefit of the House, the statutory remit of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann in regard to <Col N="2015"/>gas safety which will give more assurance as to the robust nature of the safety regime. Under its parent legislation, the Gas Act 1976, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is required to have regard for such safety requirements as are, in its opinion, necessary for the transmission and distribution of natural gas. Further functions were conferred on Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann under SI No. 238 of 1987, made under section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Gas (Amendment) Act 1987 to ensure the safety of the public. Article 8 of that order requires that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann refuse to supply gas, or refuse to continue to supply gas, if it is of the opinion that it would give rise to an abnormal risk affecting safety. The order also obliges Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to exercise at all times the practices and standards of a prudent gas undertaking and to have regard to relevant international standards and practices. The standards in use in Ireland are consistent with the latest relevant CEN, European Committee for Standardisation, and ISO, International Organisation for Standardisation, standards.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has established a comprehensive safety assurance programme, which enables the company to meet its obligations with respect to safety under this legislation. Gas is supplied only to installations that meet the requirements of this programme, one of which is that the installer has demonstrated the necessary competence in safe installations by completing the relevant F&Aacute;S course or holding an equivalent qualification. For quality assurance purposes, a quota of installations is inspected randomly after natural gas has been supplied. Where an installation is completed by an installer who is not registered with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, a mandatory inspection must take place before Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will supply gas to the premises. This system is regularly audited.</P>
        <P>The gas safety provisions in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will provide a statutory underpinning for this safety programme. It will also create an offence where certain works relating to gas installations are carried out by unregistered installers leaving such installers open to prosecution and the full rigour of the law.</P>
        <P>Such new and important safety measures underline the Government&rsquo;s commitment to further enhancing the safety of natural gas consumers and the public and ensuring that Ireland continues to meet international best practice in regard to natural gas safety.</P>

      <sTitle>Community Employment Schemes.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry"><NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue which is affecting participants and sponsoring groups the length and breadth of <Col N="2016"/>the country. Since its introduction in November 2004, the Government policy of capping F&Aacute;S community employment schemes has led to the termination of placements for hundreds of participants in County Tipperary. It is expected that 700 community employment workers will effectively be made redundant in Tipperary before the end of this year.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to take immediate steps to remove this draconian and unnecessary cap on the scheme. Given the healthy state of the economy, using community employment participants as a cost saving to the State is unjust, unfair and an example of the downright meanness displayed by the Government. It is an abuse of power against these vulnerable people.</P>
        <P>The participants on community employment schemes are involved in completing valuable work for the community. Many community groups, sporting organisations and tidy towns committees, could not undertake their worthwhile projects were it not for the crucial assistance of community employment participants. The scheme has played a very important role in improving community life across Tipperary and it is astonishing that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, is determined to close down community employment schemes by stealth. As a result of this clampdown, many talented and deserving people will lose the opportunity to contribute to their communities in a meaningful way. Local communities are losing out on important and desirable schemes.</P>
        <P>Many participants work in the community as personal assistants to severely disabled people. They work with young and old alike, they work in sports clubs, town councils, community development groups, in fact, the list is endless. It is a shameful indictment of this Government that community employment participants are under-estimated, undervalued and under-appreciated by the Minister and the Government.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats want to bring the hatchet down on community employment schemes without even a thought for the needs of either participants or the sponsoring projects. For the thousands of community and voluntary groups the removal of participants and the closure of schemes is a devastating blow. Groups are relying on community employment schemes to provide a level of staffing for certain tasks. If the Government is so intent on ending community employment schemes, an alternative source of staffing for community and voluntary groups will have to be found and funded by the Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister should be aware of the impact of the capping policy on schemes in Tipperary. For example, in Annacarty the community employment scheme had 12 participants, but when the Minister, Deputy Martin, is finished with his axe it will be halved to six. The Clonoulty-Rossmore <Col N="2017"/>scheme had 16 participants but has been reduced to ten. The scheme operating in Cappawhite and Hollyford had 20 participants but with these savage cutbacks it will be reduced to ten. In south Tipperary, 82 people were effectively made redundant in January. Another 150 will lose their place on a scheme at the end of March. In total more than 300 people will lose a place on a community employment scheme in south Tipperary by the end of this year. In north Tipperary, during the course of the next 12 months, 411 people will lose these places on schemes. These staggering figures mean that community employment scheme numbers in County Tipperary will be more than halved before the year is out.</P>
        <P>I have received numerous calls from community employment participants, many in their early or late fifties, who have been informed they are no longer needed on a scheme. Community employment schemes in Glengoole, Rathcabbin, Killenaule, and all across Tipperary are losing participants each week. It is outrageous that men and women who have served the community well on these community employment schemes are effectively being forced to retire early. These people feel there is little prospect of their getting any form of meaningful and productive employment.</P>
        <P>Several of those who contacted me outlined that they had no transport of their own, and given their age, felt they had little hope of getting any other form of employment in the area. In the increasingly competitive marketplace, many people on community employment schemes have told me the scheme is the only form of work available to them.</P>
        <P>There are schemes in Tipperary facing such uncertainty that some supervisors have informed me that their schemes could close before the end of the year. No scheme in Tipperary should be closed, wound down, or have participant numbers reduced. I urge the Government to immediately abolish the current policy of capping the number of years a person can participate on a community employment scheme and I seek the Minister&rsquo;s commitment that those participants affected will be swiftly reinstated.</P>
        <P>Immediate changes must be made to the scheme to bring to an end the policy of capping. I urge the Minister to immediately reinstate those affected by this nonsensical capping rule. I further urge that if the community employment scheme is to be abolished by stealth, as current policy and practice would suggest, the Government should provide funding for an alternative source of staffing for the thousands of community and voluntary groups that have been adversely affected by this ridiculous capping policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary purpose of community employment as an active labour market programme is to reintegrate long-term unem<Col N="2018"/>ployed persons into open labour market jobs. CE provides unemployed people with temporary opportunities whereby they can develop their skills and obtain a recent track record of work experience.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S continues to develop the content of the CE programme. The new approach involves the introduction of an individual learner plan process focused on meeting the learning needs of participants. The individual learner plan provides for the planning, organising and recording of the work experience, training and development that each participant receives while working on CE. It also includes further training and development for supervisors, a new application process and quality assurance procedures. The new approach should provide substantial benefits to F&Aacute;S clients and give increased value for the training budget invested.</P>
        <P>In 1999 the community employment programme was restructured to limit participation by new participants to three years, with effect from April 2000. This change was introduced to encourage unemployed persons to progress to training, education and employment where possible. However, this three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. In general, approximately 20% of participants, including persons less than 55 years of age, have benefited from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001.</P>
        <P>On foot of a review of F&Aacute;S employment schemes, which included detailed consultations with social partners, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment introduced changes to community employment and other employment schemes with effect from 10 November 2004. The change to the community employment programme removed the three-year cap for persons aged 55 or older. This change means that over-55s are now eligible to participate on community employment for a maximum of five years. In the case of persons advancing beyond 55 years during their normal period of service on CE, participation can also be extended for up to a maximum of six years. The new arrangements were designed to address the particular difficulty of finding replacements to participate in community employment schemes in certain rural areas. They also help to secure the continuity of community services generally.</P>
        <P>Combined with the rural social scheme, under the aegis of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which provides 2,500 places, the existing community service support framework is therefore being maintained. The current ring-fencing and prioritisation procedures for the essential services of child care, health related services and drugs task force clients are also being maintained. For those aged under 55, <Col N="2019"/>the normal service of up to three years maximum has continued to apply, subject to the current flexibility guidelines I mentioned earlier which allow for an additional year of participation. The continuation of ring-fencing and the extended participation on CE by older workers help to secure the continuity of community services generally and ensure that the existing community service support framework will be maintained.</P>
        <P>In addition to the changes introduced on CE, it was also announced in November 2004 that participants remaining on job initiative will have their contracts renewed annually. Participants who leave the programme voluntarily are, where practicable, replaced by CE participants to support the service being provided. It was also announced that 25,000 places would be available annually on F&Aacute;S employment programmes which <Col N="2020"/>comprise community employment, social economy and job initiative. The figures at the end of last year showed that the total number of places on the three programmes was approximately 26,000. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has recently taken over responsibility for the social economy programme which has been renamed the community services programme.</P>
        <P>This Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities. In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the community employment scheme under constant review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 17 together.</P>
        <P>On 3 February last, the Health Service Executive published a report, prepared by McKinsey &amp; Co., on the delivery of tertiary paediatric services in this country. This report was commissioned by the HSE at my request in the context of decisions to be taken on the possible relocation of the facilities at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and of ensuring that paediatric services are provided in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>
        <P>The Mater-Children&rsquo;s University Hospital project was planned a number of years ago with a view to significantly improving the facilities for patients and staff at both hospitals. It was envisaged at that time that paediatric secondary and tertiary services could appropriately be provided at more than one location. However, it is clear from the recent McKinsey report that current best practice suggests that best outcomes for children should be provided by one national tertiary paediatric centre which would also provide all secondary paediatric services for the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Arising from the recommendations, a joint HSE-Department of Health and Children task group has been established to progress matters and to advise on the optimal location for the new facility.</P>
        <P>The conclusions of the task group will clearly have implications for the scope of the Mater-<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="2022"/>Children&rsquo;s University hospital project and will inform decisions in relation to how that project is to be advanced. My primary concern is to ensure that we arrive at a solution which is in the best interests of the children of this country.</P>

	<P>The health contribution was introduced by virtue of the Health Contributions Act 1979 and came into effect on 6 April of that year. The contributions are levied on income at a percentage rate set in pursuance of the Health Contributions Act and proceeds are paid to the Minister for Health and Children in aid of the Vote for the Health Service Executive. The current rate of contribution is 2% of gross income. The levy is applicable to all persons over the age of 16 with reckonable income, earnings or emoluments. However, certain persons are exempt from liability to pay the health levy, including those who have full eligibility for health services, that is, medical card holders under section 45 of the Health Act 1970.</P>
        <P>Following the announcement in budget 2001 to grant full eligibility to those aged 70 and over, and the subsequent amendment of section 45 of the Health Act 1970, these people became exempt from paying health contributions. The cost to the Exchequer of including people who possess over-70&rsquo;s medical cards in the exemption from paying the health levy amounts to approximately &euro;15 million per annum.</P>

	<P>The Madden Report on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures contained 50 recommendations. Some of the recommendations, such as the formulation of human tissue legislation, are a matter for my Department. Others, such as an audit of organs retained in hospitals, are a matter for the HSE, and others fall under the aegis of other agencies, for example, the coroners legislation, is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>My officials have met officials from the National Hospital Office, NHO, and have agreed that a national implementation group will be set <Col N="2023"/>up by that office to oversee implementation of the recommendations in the report. This group, on which my Department will be represented, will hold its first meeting before the end of this month.</P>
        <P>As recommended in the report, I am establishing a working group to examine issues pertaining to non-paediatric post mortems, that is, babies who died before or at birth, minors and adults. I have asked Dr. Madden to chair the group and will be announcing the full membership shortly.</P>
        <P>In relation to legislation, Dr. Madden&rsquo;s report recommended that &ldquo;communication and authorization are vital, and must be enshrined in legislation&rdquo;. My officials, in consultation with key agencies, are examining the gaps in Irish legislation and they have started work on drafting legislation to address these gaps.</P>
        <P>The heads of a Bill for a new coroners Act have been prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That Department is examining the implications, if any, Dr. Madden&rsquo;s recommendations will have for this legislation.</P>
        <P>EU Directive 2004/23/EC relating to standards of quality and safety of tissues and cells for human application must be transposed into Irish law by 7 April 2006.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently met with representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of my wish to have the programme rolled out nationally as quickly as possible. For this to happen, essential elements of the roll-out must be in place including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes. I have made additional revenue funding of &euro;2.3 million available to BreastCheck this year to provide among other things for the early recruitment and training of staff. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of 2007 for the commencement of roll-out to the west will be met; a more exact date for roll-out will depend on the availability of adequately trained medical and technical staff, particularly radiographers. BreastCheck recently interviewed for a clinical director for the west and is in the process of making an appointment. BreastCheck is also recruiting radiographers and a second consultant radiologist. BreastCheck also recently received planning permission for the static unit at University College Hospital Galway and is now proceeding to tender for the construction of this unit.</P>
        <P>Any proposal received by BreastCheck to support the roll-out of its screening programme is carefully examined to assess the extent to which it complies with existing standards. BreastCheck has advised my Department that it has engaged in extensive discussions with the clinic referred to by the Deputy. BreastCheck has conducted an evaluation of this proposal and has concluded that it would not be in a position to provide a population based screening programme in line with BreastCheck service standards. Discussions are ongoing involving BreastCheck and the clinic concerning other options which might enable the <Col N="2025"/>clinic to contribute to the introduction of the programme in the west.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck has evaluated a number of full field digital mammography systems and has decided that full digital imaging will be used in the roll-out.</P>

	<P>In compliance with the Department of Finance reporting requirements, the Health Service Executive, HSE, provided its best estimate of the end year forecast of Exchequer issues for 2005 on 22 December 2005. This indicated a projected saving of nearly &euro;12 million on non-capital spending and a projected saving of just over &euro;56 million on capital spending. The projected capital saving had previously been identified to the Department of Finance and was included in the Appropriation Act 2005 as a capital carryover from 2005 to 2006.</P>
        <P>Subsequent figures submitted by the HSE to my Department on 17 January 2006 for the December 2005 returns to the Department of Finance showed an excess of &euro;53 million on non-capital spending and a saving of over &euro;57 million on capital. On the basis of theses figures, nearly all the capital savings would be required to offset the excess on non-capital spending. Accordingly, the Minister for Finance made no provision for a capital carryover for the HSE in the 2006 Revised Estimates for Public Services and public capital programme.</P>
        <P>The figures provided in January are subject to further revision and the final 2005 figures will be confirmed when the HSE finalises its annual Appropriation Accounts for Vote 40. The HSE is currently working on this and the Appropriation Accounts must be finalised by the end of March. The 2006 capital allocation for the HSE will be reviewed in the light of the final outturn figures for 2005 and, if necessary, a Supplementary Estimate will be taken for 2006.</P>
        <P>As will be apparent from the foregoing, there has been no question of an error in the HSE accounts. I am, naturally, concerned at the significant differences between the December forecast outturn figures and the January estimated out<Col N="2026"/>turn figures. Apart from any other considerations, it makes it more difficult to plan and manage 2006 expenditure. However, the final figures will be provided by the HSE later this month.</P>
        <P>I recognise that it will take some time for the HSE to introduce a single accounting system throughout the organisation which is capable of providing full dual accounting &mdash; the standard Vote accounts &mdash; and the income and expenditure accounts operated by the former health boards. However, I am assured by the HSE that its systems are fully capable of accounting for all transactions within the organisation and I expect to see a significant improvement this year in the quality of their in-year expenditure management returns.</P>

Following that meeting the foundation, with the support of a grant of &euro;70,000 from my Department, convened a National Stroke Review Group, NSRG. The NSRG has representatives from the HSE &mdash; population health &mdash; and a wide range of relevant professional and voluntary organisations &mdash; community health nurses, speech therapists, volunteer scheme etc. The group developed a comprehensive research proposal over a period of nine months based on methods used for an audit of hospital and community services in the UK.</P>
        <P>The planned research, which is due to start this month, is for a national audit of stroke services, to include an audit of hospital-based stroke services: organisational aspects of care in acute hospitals, especially &ldquo;organised stroke care&rdquo; and a clinical audit of stroke care, involving review of clinical case notes for a selected sample of patients; and an audit of community-based stroke services, to include surveys of GPs, allied health professionals, patients and carers, and nursing homes.</P>
        <P>These audits will provide excellent baseline information on which to benchmark progress in developing stroke services and I understand the entire study is scheduled to take 18 months to complete. The NSRG will monitor progress of the research and use the findings to make recommendations on the development of stroke services. The Department and the Health Service Executive will consider policy implications in the light of this national service audit.</P>

	<P>On 1 February I announced, together with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, details of a major reform programme in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education and training, based on the recommendations in the Report of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training, chaired by Professor Pat Fottrell, and the Report of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Group, chaired by Dr. Jane Buttimer. Both reports were published on that date.</P>
        <P>The initial indicative cost of implementing the reform programme approved by the Government is estimated to be in the region of &euro;200 million over the period 2006-10, subject to undertaking further costing studies and an audit of existing and required facilities. In particular, the overall capital requirements in the undergraduate and postgraduate areas will be the subject of detailed appraisal of existing infrastructure and future needs.</P>
        <P>Among the major reforms to be funded at undergraduate level are: a more than doubling of the number of medical places for Irish and EU students over a four year period from 305 to 725; the introduction of a new graduate entry programme for medicine from 2007 as part of the overall expansion of places; curriculum and clinical training developments aimed at enhancing the quality of undergraduate medical education; the development of a new aptitude test for selection for graduate entry to medicine; devising proposals for a new selection mechanism for entry to undergraduate medicine to involve a combination of CAO points and suitability test performance from 2008 at the earliest; and the creation of new academic clinician posts to be jointly funded by the education and health sectors.</P>
        <P>Among the major reforms to be funded at postgraduate level are: improved retention of graduates from Irish medical schools through a range of measures to enhance the quality and attractiveness of postgraduate specialist training; phasing out NCHD posts with limited training value within a feasible and realistic timeframe; better workforce planning to align the numbers of doctors in training with projected consultant vacancies; inclusion in the Medical Practitioners Bill of provisions to assign appropriate medical education and training functions to the HSE and, where appropriate, the Medical and Dental Councils; implementing the training principles to be incorporated into new working arrangements <Col N="2028"/>for doctors in training; and the development of research in the health sector.</P>

	<P>Proposals for a new employment contract for consultants working in the public health system were recently tabled by the management side in the context of the consultants&rsquo; contract negotiations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new contract will be a first step towards the introduction of a consultant-provided service and the appointment of large numbers of dedicated public hospital and community based consultants, working in teams. This will be matched by a reduction in the number of non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
        <P>A consultant-provided service is dependent on consultants assuming a new role. The contract will set out the terms and conditions associated with employment as a consultant dedicated exclusively to the public health service. It will recognise consultants as senior employees with lead responsibility, within established best practice, for decisions on patient care and treatment.</P>
        <P>The public only contract will differ from the existing category 1 contract. While the category 1 contract permits the consultant to charge private patients for treatment in the public hospital only, the new contract will not permit that. This will help to ensure that all patients, both public and private, will be treated in an equitable manner.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 30, 80 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>The report of the Lourdes Hospital inquiry, chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark, was published on Tuesday last. The inquiry was established by the Government in 2004 following the decision of the Medical Council to remove Dr. Michael Neary from the Register of Medical Practitioners after finding him guilty of professional misconduct.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the last few years have been particularly difficult and traumatic for many former patients of the maternity unit at Drogheda, and yesterday I met with Patient Focus to discuss the findings of the report. The question of compensation will now be considered by my Department in the light of the report&rsquo;s findings and in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance, with a view to bringing a proposal to Government.</P>
        <P>This is a damning report and it is clear from the findings that many lessons need to be learned and changes made to ensure that such events do not happen again in Irish hospitals. The findings and recommendations are being examined in detail by my Department which will consult with the Health Service Executive and the various professional regulatory bodies. The recommendations in the report will act as a significant catalyst in the reform agenda. They confirm the appropriateness of the actions being taken in relation to the preparation of the new Medical Practitioners Bill, the reform of the current consultant contract and the changes in management systems within hospitals.</P>
        <P>The forthcoming Medical Practitioners Bill will make continuing professional development and education compulsory. It will also ensure that competence assurance will be given a statutory basis. Furthermore, in the context of the consultant contract talks, the management side have put forward proposals to ensure that consultants work in teams with clear clinical leaders who will ensure that individual clinical practice is in line with best practice.</P>
        <P>One of the many disturbing findings in the report is that the obstetric hysterectomy records of 44 patients are missing and that they were <Col N="2030"/>intentionally and unlawfully removed from the hospital with the object of protecting those involved in carrying out the hysterectomies or in protecting the reputation of the hospital. The inquiry is satisfied that a person or persons unidentified, who had knowledge of where records were stored and who had easy access to those records, was responsible for a deliberate, careful and systematic removal of key historical records which are missing, together with master cards and patient charts.</P>
        <P>In relation to the conclusions regarding the deliberate removal of patient records, I have invited the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine the report to determine whether further investigation is now warranted.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 78 together.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, a provider must undertake a contract of care in regard to each dependent person and-or a person acting on his-her behalf. This is set out in paragraphs 7.1 to 7.3 of the nursing home regulations. Also, under the Code of Practice for Nursing Homes published by the Department of Health and Children, there are specific requirements in regard to a contract of care; these are set out under section 5 of the code, which is voluntary.</P>
        <P>The HSE, when contracting beds from private nursing homes for the provision of care to clients referred by the HSE, enters into an agreement with the home in relation to all aspects of the contract and service provision.</P>
        <P>The nursing home is required to be registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the provider must have the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise to provide appropriate care to clients referred by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The provider must undertake, during the term of the agreement, that it will at all times provide care and welfare for each of the patients-clients identified by the HSE in proper accordance with their individual needs and requirements and, more particularly, strictly in accordance at all <Col N="2031"/>times with the terms, conditions and obligations contained in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, as amended. Generally, prior to admission a care plan, which will specify the extent of the services required by the patient-client, must be developed by the provider in conjunction with the hospital referring each patient-client and the provider undertakes to implement same. This will include all services considered essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home.</P>

	<P>The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, is responsible for the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services and for the accreditation of institutions providing training for ambulance personnel.</P>
        <P>The council conducts national examinations to determine if individuals have achieved the emergency medical technician-paramedic standard suitable for the awarding of the national qualification in emergency medical technology, NQEMT. It also has an assessment process for recognising equivalent qualifications obtained within and outside the State. Almost 2,000 individuals are on its database as having achieved this standard.</P>
        <P>My Department is advised by the council that the NQEMT exceeds the emergency medical technician standards that apply in the UK, North America and Australasia.</P>
        <P>The most significant development in the ambulance sector for many years is the roll-out of the advanced paramedic training programme. The National Ambulance Training School, which operates under the auspices of the Health Service Executive, in conjunction with University College Dublin, is providing training for advanced paramedic candidates on behalf of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.</P>
        <P>Currently, emergency medical technicians can administer four drugs to treat pain, chest pain and low blood sugar levels. The programme will ensure that trained personnel can administer a range of additional medications &mdash; 19 &mdash; which include, for example, cardiac medications.</P>
        <P>The NATS trained 36 advanced paramedics in 2005 and hopes to train a further 48 in the current year. It is envisaged that initial operational deployment of the service will commence during 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department has allocated funding to the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council each year <Col N="2032"/>since 2004 to facilitate the rolling out of the training element of the programme.</P>
        <P>The council has also recently established a professional register for pre-hospital emergency care practitioners. The register is similar to the registers already in use for other health care professionals. It is designed to ensure that everyone on the register operates under the standards and guidelines laid down by the council, that they have the skill and competency required to operate at a designated level, that they maintain their skill levels and participate in continuous professional development.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 114 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is in ongoing discussions with the Health Service Executive with regard to the need for improvement in accident and emergency services, with a particular focus on reducing the numbers on trolleys and the waiting times for patients in individual hospitals.</P>
        <P>There is a need to build on the existing action plan for accident and emergency services and, in particular, to adopt a more focused approach that concentrates on individual hospital performance. Arising from the discussions with the HSE, a number of proposals have been agreed, including provision for specific performance improvement targets for individual hospitals.</P>
        <P>With regard to neurology services, additional funding of &euro;3 million was allocated specifically for the further development of neurology and neurophysiology services as part of the Estimates for health services in 2006. This funding was provided to allow the Health Service Executive further progress the implementation of the recommendations made by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in respect of these services. The Comhairle report, which has been published, recommended significant enhancement of services, including the appointment of additional consultants. While reaching the full complement of consultant posts as recommended will take some time, major improvements in patient care can be achieved in the shorter term through a combination of additional consultant posts and the appointment of a number of clinical nurse specialists and allied health professionals.</P>
        <P>My Department is advised by the executive that the development of three new neurology units will commence during 2006, one in the mid-west, one in the north west and one in the south east, with the appointment of multi-disciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff.</P>
        <P>The HSE will also be investing in neurophysiology services in 2006, with the development of an innovative teleneurophysiology link between Sligo General Hospital and Beaumont Hospital. This initiative is designed to reduce waiting times for diagnostic testing.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 51, 64, 68, 86 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>I am fully committed to the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme in line with international best practice to reduce incidence and mortality from cervical cancer. My Department is in detailed discussions with the Health Service Executive in relation to the most efficient and cost effective way to deliver a national programme. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call-recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money. All elements of the programme &mdash; call-recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services &mdash; must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service. I am convinced that we must also have in place tailored initiatives to encourage take up among disadvantaged and difficult to reach groups. I made available an additional &euro;9 million to the executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for a national programme.</P>
        <P>I consider that the programme should be best rolled out in the primary care setting, subject to affordable and acceptable arrangements being agreed. A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision by general practitioners of publicly-funded primary care services is being conducted at present under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. I have requested that the general practitioner elements of a national cervical screening programme be tabled at these discussions. Any remuneration arrange<Col N="2035"/>ments agreed must be capable of delivering a high uptake among women. Payments must be primarily based on reaching acceptable targets. The actual costs of the programme will depend significantly on the level of primary care fees, the screening intervals agreed and maximising laboratory efficiencies, including the application of new technologies. I wish to see the programme rolled out as quickly as possible but only when the essential infrastructure, organisation and services are in place that are quality assured and meet international standards.</P>
        <P>Cervical smear testing is not currently provided by GPs under the scheme for medical card holders. However, where cervical smears form part of recognised protocols for the ongoing treatment of individual patient illnesses, they should be provided free of charge to eligible women under the GMS scheme. Any necessary follow-up treatment is available to all women, including medical card holders, within the public hospital system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Implementation of the primary care strategy requires the development of new ways of working and reorganisation of the resources already available to the health service, as well as additional investment in order to provide extra capacity. This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service, and not solely within primary care itself. The estimated cost of implementation of the primary care strategy over an initial period of ten years is contained in the strategy document, Primary Care: A New Direction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The strategy estimated the additional staffing costs involved, allowing for the availability of existing staff and taking account of the composition of typical core teams and the associated network professionals, at approximately &euro;615 million per annum for the first 400 to 600 teams. The capital cost, at 2001 prices, of developing a primary care facility was estimated at some &euro;2.5 million for each team, which is approximately &euro;1.27 billion for the first 400 to 600 teams. The strategy also estimated that up to &euro;63 million in once-off costs and running costs of &euro;12.7 million per annum would be required for ICT supports.</P>
        <P>In relation to implementation, an initial group of ten primary care teams have been established nationally, with funding to enable existing staff resources within the public system to be augmented. Funding has also been applied to a range <Col N="2036"/>of other initiatives intended to advance implementation. These include: planning and mapping work by the HSE; service developments in specific locations; a review of ICT needs in primary care; support to university departments of general practice and the Irish College of General Practitioners; and research fellowships in primary care.</P>
        <P>To support further implementation of the strategy in 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;16 million has been provided. Of this funding, &euro;10 million is to support the establishment of 75 to 100 primary care teams nationally. This will enable the provision of 300 additional frontline personnel to work alongside GPs to provide integrated and accessible services in the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been informed by the HSE that work to establish these primary care teams in development is under way. I understand that the executive will be targeting the funding so as to provide each local health office of the HSE with the potential to develop up to three primary care teams. The executive hopes to focus where possible on areas of disadvantage and with health inequalities in planning for the establishment of these teams.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;4 million has been provided for the establishment of additional GP training places and &euro;2 million to enhance GP out-of-hours co-ops. This means that, taking into account development funding provided since 2002, &euro;28 million is available in 2006 specifically to support the implementation of the primary care strategy. However, other development funding will also be used to support the delivery of services in line with the principles of the strategy.</P>

	<P>Section 58 of the Health Act 1970 provides that the Health Service Executive, HSE, shall make available without charge general practitioner services to persons with full eligibility under the Act and to persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the executive, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange such services for themselves and their dependants. In accordance with section 7(4) of the Health Act 2004, the executive may deliver health and personal social services directly or arrange to have them delivered on its behalf.</P>
        <P>In most cases the HSE contracts with suitably qualified and equipped providers for the delivery of general practitioner services to persons entitled under the law to receive such services free of charge. General practitioner services should, as far as possible, continue to be delivered on this basis. Where the HSE judges that the direct provision of the service is the most beneficial, effective and efficient means of meeting the needs of the relevant population, it is open to it to decide directly to employ appropriately qualified professionals for this purpose.</P>
        <P>A review of the contractual arrangements for the delivery of publicly funded general practitioner services is being conducted at present under the chairmanship of the Labour Relations Commission. This fundamental review must result in a new set of contractual arrangements which result in the provision by general practitioners of high-quality, person-centred primary care services to individuals and communities, support the achievement of national health policy objectives and provide a challenging and fulfilling working environment for doctors.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that an investment package of an additional &euro;150 million has been put in place for services for older people and palliative care for 2006 and 2007, of which &euro;55 million was allocated to home care packages. This is a full year cost, &euro;30 million of which is for 2006, during which an additional 2,000 packages will be provided by the Health Service Executive across the country. Some 1,100 packages are provided at present. The priority will be older people living in the community or who are inpatients in an acute hospital who may otherwise require admission to residential care. The home care packages will also <Col N="2038"/>be available to those older people who have been admitted to long-term care and who now wish to return to the community.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that this focus on care in the community for older people will not be confined to 2006 and 2007 but represents a shift away from residential care, as a first option, that will continue into the future. The Deputy will be aware that the Mercer report on the Future Financing of Long-Term Care in Ireland, which was commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, examined all issues surrounding the financing of long-term care. Following on the publication of this report, a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, was established. The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including improvements in community care, taking account of the Mercer report. This group presented its report to Government, where it is under consideration.</P>

        <P>It will be recalled that both medical organisations &mdash; the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA &mdash; would not participate in contract negotiations until the extension of the clinical indemnity scheme, CIS, to consultants was resolved.</P>
        <P>Talks on a new contract commenced on 24 November 2005 under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Mark Connaughton SC. At that meeting, and a further plenary meeting in December, both the IHCA and the IMO indicated that they required a number of issues to be addressed before they could engage in substantive negotiations on a new contract.</P>
        <P>While some of these issues remain unresolved, a position paper outlining proposals on a new employment contract for consultants working in the public health system was tabled by manage<Col N="2039"/>ment at a plenary meeting on 26 January 2006. The medical organisations have refused to engage in substantive discussions on these proposals. At a further meeting on 9 February the talks were adjourned without any further date being set for their resumption.</P>
        <P>While a further meeting between management and the consultant representative bodies has not been arranged, the independent chairman is maintaining contact with both sides with a view to arranging a formula to effect the resumption of substantive and intensive negotiations at an early date. I am anxious for the negotiations to be concluded within a reasonable timeframe. The Health Service Executive will have responsibility for overseeing the full implementation of the new contract arrangements.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 46 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Services Executive&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2006 which has been laid before the Houses of Oireachtas, states that there are 53 public acute hospitals with a total of 13,771 beds, inpatient and day places, at October 2005.</P>
        <P>An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to expand public hospital beds in line with the health strategy commitment to increase total acute hospital bed capacity by 3,000 by 2011. Substantial investment in additional bed capacity in acute hospitals has already taken place.</P>
        <P>Funding has been provided to open an additional 900 inpatient beds and day places in public acute hospitals throughout the country. The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that 818 of these beds and day places are in place and the remaining 82 beds and day places will come on stream over the coming months.</P>
        <P>In addition, a further 450 acute beds and day places are in various stages of planning and development under the capital investment framework 2005-09. In July 2005, I announced an initiative which will provide up to an additional 1,000 beds for public patients in public hospitals <Col N="2042"/>over the next five years. The Estimates for 2006 include &euro;60 million to open new acute hospital facilities some of which will provide additional inpatient beds and day places. These additional inpatient beds and day places will go some way to achieving our commitment in the programme for Government to increase total acute hospital capacity.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, will be reviewing public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector in the light of developments since the health strategy was published. My Department is in discussion with the HSE on an assessment to be carried out by them regarding long-term care residential requirements for older people, including respite and intermediate care.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al published a report of a review of neurology and neurophysiology services in April 2003. The report recommended significant enhancement of these services, including increases in consultant staffing. As part of the Estimates for health services in 2006, additional funding of &euro;3 million was allocated specifically for the further development of neurology and neurophysiology services. My Department is advised by the executive that the development of three new neurology units will commence during 2006, one in the mid-west, one in the north west and one in the south east, with the appointment of multi-disciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff.</P>
        <P>The HSE will also be investing in neurophysiology services in 2006, with the development of an innovative teleneurophysiology link between Sligo General Hospital and Beaumont Hospital. This initiative is designed to reduce waiting times for diagnostic testing.</P>

	<P>The established and agreed policy on general practitioner out of hours co-operative services is outlined in the national health strategy Quality and Fairness A Health System for You, which commits to further development of this area. The GP co-operatives provide the means for all patients, both medical card and private, to access appropriate qualified medical care out of hours, including domiciliary visits where deemed appropriate, by dialling a lo-call number. The development of GP co-operatives is being undertaken as part of the overall strengthening of primary care services available to patients and to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, patients care needs are met in the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>The first full out of hours general practitioner co-operative began in the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s south eastern area in 1999 and was adjudged one of the most significant developments in the area of general practice. In 2000, this co-operative service along with that operated in the HSE&rsquo;s north eastern area were independently evaluated and found to be an enhancement of the care available to patients. The evaluations also found that the services provided were held in high regard by both the patient and the service provider.</P>
        <P>Between 2000 and 2005, approximately &euro;105 million has been provided for the development of GP out of hours co-operatives. In 2006 approximately &euro;33 million is available to the HSE, of which &euro;2 million is new funding in the current year. The HSE is at present giving consideration to the further developments to be undertaken on foot of this additional funding. Out of hours co-operatives are now found in part of all HSE areas, providing coverage in part or all of the 26 counties. The geographical areas to be covered by co-operatives and any expansion are decisions for the HSE to make, having regard to the strategic, financial and other issues involved.</P>
        <P>Some of the co-operatives have put in place systems to monitor the satisfaction levels of patients using the service and in others independent evaluation on customer reactions are undertaken. In the HSE&rsquo;s western area an independent evaluation of the co-operative, conducted by National University of Ireland, Galway, found high levels of patient satisfaction with the service provided by the doctors and recorded that 30% of survey respondents would have gone to a hospital accident and emergency unit if the service had not been available.</P>
        <P>In the context of their operational responsibility for GP out of hours services I understand that the HSE intends to undertake a review of this service area, and that the terms of reference for this task are under consideration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 56 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the principles contained in the primary care strategy, which provides a template for the reform and development of primary care services over a period of ten to 15 years.</P>
        <P>The chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive has also emphasised the importance of developing primary care services, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals. This is an important priority of the executive and has my full endorsement. The implementation process at operational level is a function of the HSE which, under the Health Act 2004, is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.</P>
        <P>To support further implementation of the strategy in 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;16 million has been provided. Of this funding, &euro;10 million is to support the establishment of 75-100 primary care teams nationally. This will enable the provision of 300 additional frontline personnel to work alongside GPs in order to provide integrated and accessible services in the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been informed by the HSE that work to establish these primary care teams in development is under way. I understand that the executive will be targeting the funding so as to provide each local health office of the HSE with the potential to develop up to three primary care teams. The executive hopes to focus where possible on areas of disadvantage and with health inequalities in planning for the establishment of these teams.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;4 million has been provided for the establishment of additional GP training places and &euro;2 million to enhance GP out-of-hours co-ops. This means that, taking into account development funding provided since 2002, &euro;28 million is available in 2006 specifically to support the implementation of the primary care strategy. However, other development funding will also be used to support the delivery of services in line with the principles of the strategy.</P><Col N="2045"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>Wider implementation of the primary care strategy will focus on developing new ways of working and of reorganising the resources already available to the health service in line with the service model described in the strategy. This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service, and not solely within primary care itself.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 107 together.</P>
        <P>The youth homelessness strategy was published on 31 October 2001. The strategy provides a strategic framework for youth homelessness to be tackled on a national basis. The goal of the strategy is &ldquo;to reduce and if possible eliminate youth homelessness through preventative strategies and where a child becomes homeless to ensure that he/she benefits from a comprehensive range of services aimed at reintegrating him/her into his /her community as quickly as possible&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the strategy, the former health boards, now the Health Service Executive, had lead responsibility for implementation of the strategy and they prepared detailed action plans in this regard to address youth homelessness in line with the objectives set out in the strategy. During 2005, my Department requested the HSE to undertake a review of the action plans to ascertain the extent of their implementation. A copy of this <Col N="2046"/>report was received on 24 February 2006 and is under consideration by my Department.</P>
        <P>I can also advise that a considerable amount of work has been done in this area since the publication of the strategy. This work was undertaken by the youth homelessness strategy monitoring committee, YHSMC, under the chairmanship of the National Children&rsquo;s Office, now part of the recently established Office of the Minister for Children, and representative of the child care policy unit of my Department and other relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The committee identified key areas, which required attention in order to drive the implementation of the strategy in an effective, co-ordinated way, on a nationwide basis. A number of sub-groups were established as follows: The programme of action for children office, a unit within the HSE, agreed to take on the co-ordination and linkages functions within the HSE. The Office of the Minister for Children will continue to deal with cross-sectoral co-ordination issues.</P>
        <P>National guidelines on leaving and aftercare were approved by the YHS monitoring committee and were circulated by my Department to the former health boards in July 2004. The purpose of the guidelines is to assist the HSE in developing its leaving and aftercare policies with the aim of, <i>inter alia</i>, protecting those leaving care who may be vulnerable to homelessness.</P>
        <P>The statistics sub-group recommended the introduction of a new youth homelessness contact form as a way of gathering more reliable and consistent statistics. My Department circulated the form to the former health boards in December 2003 for introduction on 1 January 2004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The contact form provides more information than was previously collected, and revised tables on youth homelessness are being included in the interim minimum dataset for 2004. The revised tables include new categories for reasons for homelessness such as a young person abandoned by parent or caregiver, a young person running away from care placement and family dispute or breakdown. The revised tables also examine the reason given for homelessness with the outcome, and the reason given for homelessness with the age of the young person. The full statistics for 2004 have not been compiled yet. The interim minimum dataset for 2003 provides the following reasons for children becoming homeless.</P><Col N="2045"/>

        <P FLI="0">A sub-group was established to look at the education and training objectives of the youth homelessness strategy. Membership of the group included representatives of the statutory and voluntary education and health sectors. It was agreed that there was a need to look at a broad understanding of the homelessness process to understand the potential impact of education and training elements as part of the solution for young people who are homeless. Consideration was given to: the preventive aspect of educational and training interventions; processes to ensure that education and training elements form part of the ongoing support of children and young people who are homeless; and the role of education and training in the prevention and reintegration of children in the care or detention systems.</P>
        <P>The group finalised its report and it was sent to the relevant Departments, the national education welfare board and the Health Service Executive on 21 June 2005.</P>
        <P>A sub-group was established to examine information and advocacy in the context of the youth homelessness strategy, with a particular focus on making relevant information more accessible to young homeless people or young people at risk of becoming homeless. The group finalised its report and it was sent to my Department, the Health Service Executive and Comhairle on 21 November 2005.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the youth homelessness strategy, significant progress has been made. Approximately &euro;12 million has been allocated by the Department of Health and Children to the former health boards for the development of youth homelessness services since 2001 and 195 new whole-time equivalent posts have been filled across the Health Service Executive, up to 31 <Col N="2048"/>December 2004. Although these posts impact on youth homelessness services, they are not all exclusively dedicated to youth homelessness services. Some 11 new units have opened nationwide and over 42 new or extended services, including aftercare, have been developed around the country.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services. In recent years many services have been developed to counter the problem of youth homelessness in the Dublin region. The crisis intervention service for young people out of home is based in the city centre and includes an outreach service, emergency out of hours social work service, reception centre, residential units and a day centre. A director for homelessness was appointed in the former eastern regional health authority, Health Service Executive eastern area, in 2000. I am advised that this is now the role of the national care group manager social inclusion since the establishment of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>In Cork, Liberty Street House became fully operational in 2003, and acts as a focal point for youth homelessness services in Cork. The centre provides a variety of services, including social work, medical, financial services, for young people out of home or in danger of becoming homeless.</P>
        <P>Services for homeless children are also provided by the other Health Service Executive areas and generally these are provided as part of the child protection and welfare services. The services provided include units for young people out of home supported lodgings, and the provision of out-reach, leaving and after care services.</P>

	<P>The practice of pharmacy is governed by the Pharmacy Acts 1875 to 1962. I am aware that the current fitness to practice provisions in these Acts are inadequate for the modern practice of pharmacy. On foot of the recommendations of the pharmacy review group I obtained Government approval in June 2005 to commence the process of drafting, as a priority, new pharmacy legislation to allow, among other things, the making of fitness to practice regulations for pharmacists. The purpose of these new provisions is to ensure the highest standards from pharmacists and to safeguard the safe and effective delivery of pharmaceutical services. My Department is at an advanced stage in drawing up the heads and general scheme of a pharmacy fitness to practice Bill and I intend to take a memorandum to Government in the very near future, seeking approval for the draft heads and general scheme and requesting that the legislation be referred to the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office for formal drafting of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Retail pharmacies only require a state contract where they wish to provide services under the community drug schemes. Information regarding the number of pharmacies operating without a community pharmacy contractor agreement is not collected by my Department.</P>
        <P>According to the Pharmacy Act 1962, SI 14/1962, the keeping of open shop for dispensing of medical prescriptions and sale of poisons must be personally supervised by a person who is registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, is employed in a whole-time capacity and is not acting in a similar capacity for any other body corporate or any authorised person or on his or her own behalf.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 60, 96 and 133 together.</P>
        <P>On foot of the recommendations of the pharmacy review group, approval was given in Government decision S180/20/10/0831 of 21 June 2005 to allow my Department commence drafting new pharmacy legislation by way of two pharmacy Bills. The first Bill is to deal with fitness to practice provisions for pharmacists, the removal of the prohibition, or the derogation, on non-Irish graduates being supervising pharmacists in pharmacies less than three years old, and a stronger statutory basis for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.</P>
        <P>This Bill will ensure the highest standards from the profession and ensure the safe and effective delivery of pharmaceutical services to all citizens of the State. It will also update the governance of the PSI, including wider non-pharmacist representation on its council, and modernise the regulations with respect to the registration of pharmacists, including non-EU and EEA graduates while dealing with some matters concerning the delivery of pharmaceutical services in a community setting.</P>
        <P>The second Bill is to legislate for pharmacy practice and the delivery of pharmaceutical services. This Bill will address the regulation of pharmacy and pharmacy services, including issues such as the definition of pharmacy services, the definition of a community pharmacy, enhanced provisions for the inspection of pharmacies, the provision for regulation of pharmacies in respect of matters such as physical conditions, standards, record keeping and promotional activities.</P>
        <P>It is also proposed to deal with general provisions relating to community pharmacy contracts for services, and the remaining recommendations of the pharmacy review group. This will include the recommendation that there should be no beneficial ownership or business interest of any kind between prescribing and dispensing and, in <Col N="2051"/>regard to group premises with adjacent pharmacies, contracted pharmacies and general practices should occupy discrete premises, with separate entrances. The Government has accepted this recommendation.</P>
        <P>While I am not in a position to regulate for ownership or market share, I have agreed to consider the potential conflict of interest issues arising from the development of health centres with adjacent pharmacies, in the context of the second Bill. In the interim, my Department has advised the Health Service Executive to take due care in assessing pharmacy contract applications so that any commercial relationship between a pharmacy contractor and a health centre will not affect the proper provision of services as required under clauses 21, 22(3), 22(4) and 23 of the contract dealing with ownership of pharmacies and beneficial interest.</P>
        <P>My Department is at an advanced stage in drawing up the heads and general scheme of a pharmacy fitness to practice Bill and I intend to take a memorandum to Government in the very near future, seeking approval for the draft heads and general scheme and requesting that the legislation be referred to the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office for formal drafting of the Bill.</P>

        <Quest>if previous plans to move the acute psychiatric unit in St. Sinan&rsquo;s Hospital to Wexford General Hospital are now being rejected, due to the new report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision For Change; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the expert group on mental health policy A Vision for Change was launched on 24 January 2006. This policy envisions an active, flexible and community-based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. It will require substantial funding, but there is considerable equity in buildings and lands within the current mental health system, which could be realised to fund this plan. Therefore, this report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service. The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of mental health services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accord<Col N="2052"/>ingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to recent research suggesting that cardiovascular diseases cost Ireland more than &euro;866 million in 2003, but that spending here on this area is among the lowest in the EU; the steps she intends to take to deal with this situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The study to which the question refers is the Economic Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases in the Enlarged EU, by Leal J, Luengo-Fern&aacute;ndez R, Gray A, Petersen S and Rayner M. European Heart Journal, doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehi733.</P>
        <P>I understand that the authors set out to provide an estimate of the economic costs of cardiovascular disease for EU countries. Data were obtained from published studies of health care costs and health service utilisation. It appears that all costs for health care in Ireland were extrapolated from costs in other countries.</P>
        <P>It is unclear how some of costs were estimated, for example, annual loss of earnings or the cost for a day&rsquo;s inpatient care. The data on costs and resource implications were used to estimate the costs of cardiovascular disease.</P>
        <P>Given that the authors may have underestimated the true costs in Ireland, there are question marks about the accuracy of the overall findings as they relate to this country. It is also possible that the authors did not include the costs of services provided in the private sector.</P>
        <P>There has been rapid expansion in cardiology services in Ireland in recent years. The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, was launched in 1999. The report makes recommendations about the prevention, treatment and surveillance of coronary heart disease across a number of sectors and the full range of health service activities, in health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, acute hospital services and cardiac rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>Since 2000 the Government has committed over &euro;60 million towards the implementation of the strategy. This funding has supported a wide range of new regional services and initiatives, which have had a measurable impact on the diagnosis, and treatment of patients with heart disease. More than 800 new posts have been created, including 19 additional consultant cardiology posts.</P><Col N="2053"/>
        <P>We have made progress in addressing the key challenges in the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy in the following areas: improving population health by supporting intersectoral work for health promotion, to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and improve quality of life; ensuring equitable access to services by continued provision of resources and support to fully implement outstanding cardiovascular health strategy recommendations to meet the needs of the growing numbers of older people and to provide new treatments for which there is evidence of effectiveness; and improving the quality of services by developing and implementing practice guidelines, the implementation of cardiovascular health information systems, support for clinical audit and for research to enhance the quality of services.</P>
        <P>It appears that the study may not reflect the current level of expenditure and service provision. The study is useful however in drawing to our attention the high costs of cardiovascular disease both in Ireland and at European level, not just the costs of health care but also the costs to the economy and to families and carers.</P>

This group presented its report to Government, where it is under consideration.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 104 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, was launched on 24 January 2006. This report is the first comprehensive review of mental health policy since Planning for the Future was published in 1984 and has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of mental health policy. The report proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems. It proposes a person-centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, and evolved and agreed with service users and their carers. Special emphasis is given to the need to involve service users and their families and carers at every level of service provision.</P>
        <P>This policy envisions an active, flexible and community based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. It will require substantial funding but there is considerable equity in buildings and lands within the current mental health system, which <Col N="2060"/>could be realised to fund this plan. Therefore, this report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service. The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.</P>
        <P>The programme of investment has already begun with an additional &euro;25 million allocated to the HSE in the Estimates for 2006 for mental health services. Significant capital investment will also be required to implement A Vision for Change for the provision of new and replacement facilities for the mental health services. This has been estimated by the expert group to be of the order of &euro;800 million and much of it could be realised from the value of existing hospitals and lands.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive, which has primary responsibility for implementing the recommendations of the expert report has stated that the national mental health directorate within the HSE will immediately establish an implementation group to ensure the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long-stay charges for publicly funded residential care. All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full. Draft heads of a Bill for a repayment scheme were submitted to Government in <Col N="2062"/>December and approved. The draft heads have been submitted to parliamentary counsel for drafting and it is my intention to have the Bill published in the current parliamentary session and have repayments commence shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law.</P>
        <P>In the preparation of the legislation there were many complex issues which required clarification. My Department had consultations with a wide range of Departments and agencies to ensure the provisions of the scheme adequately addressed these issues. These provisions included exempting from income tax those who are alive, to allow for repayments to take account of inflation by use of the consumer price index and to allow repayments to living persons and their spouses to be disregarded in means assessment for health and social welfare benefits. Consultations with the probate office of the High Court have also resulted in a streamlined process where a grant of probate is required for an application on behalf of a deceased person. The provisions of the Bill will also provide appropriate safeguards for those who are not in a position to manage their own affairs.</P>
        <P>Extensive consultation has also taken place with the oversight committee appointed to provide an independent input into the design and monitoring of the scheme. The committee is fully briefed on all aspects of the scheme and has provided valuable input into the legislative process to date. The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified as a result of initial payments made following my announcement in December 2004. In advance of the selection of an outside company, I have requested the HSE to begin to proactively identify and work up the details of repayments due to living persons to enable prompt repayments to be made. The scheme will include an independent transparent and thorough appeals process.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has responsibility for administering this repayment scheme, including the recruitment of an outside company to manage the scheme within the agreed parameters. This outside company will also provide an independent assessment of the amount of repayment due to each applicant under the scheme. It will also help to reassure the public that the scheme is being operated in the most equitable and effective manner possible. The HSE has recently re-advertised a new procurement process for the selection of a company to administer the scheme. As the selection process is by negotiated procedure, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the expected cost of such a company.</P><Col N="2063"/>
        <P>As already indicated, the HSE is undertaking a procurement process to select this outside company. Consideration has been given to the involvement of public sector staff to assist in administering the scheme, albeit not specifically from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The HSE has informed my Department that the time constraints of the procurement process do not allow for comprehensive consideration of these possible options, which would materially alter the specifications of the tendering documentation due to issue on 6 March.</P>

The national task force on medical staffing was charged with examining how this directive could be implemented without adversely affecting service delivery. Against the background of the required decrease in non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, working hours, the task force recommended the introduction of a consultant provided service and an increase in the number of consultants.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>The strategic task force on alcohol was established in January 2002 and given a remit to recommend specific evidence based measures to Government to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm. It has published two reports which together provide approximately 100 recommendations across a wide range of sectors. Significant progress has already been made across <Col N="2066"/>Departments in implementing the task force recommendations.</P>
        <P>Legislative measures which have been adopted include the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 which assists in regulating availability. Happy hours have been abolished and restrictions on the access of children to licensed premises have been introduced. The Road Traffic Act 2003 extended the grounds for requesting a breath test to detect alcohol and the Minister for Transport has indicated his commitment to the introduction of random breath testing. A voluntary code of practice on alcohol advertising has been agreed between the Department of Health and Children and the drinks, media and advertising industries. This addresses many of the concerns about alcohol advertising. The T&aacute;naiste has indicated her intention to introduce legislation if there is insufficient adherence to the voluntary code.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant progress has also been made in terms of research projects, the delivery of responsible server training, awareness raising campaigns, etc. Community mobilisation projects have been identified internationally as one of the most effective measures at reducing alcohol related harm. Resources have been allocated to the Health Service Executive to support such projects here. As the Deputy will be aware the executive functions of this Department have transferred to the Health Service Executive which will now have responsibility for progressing many of the task force recommendations.</P>

Both reports were published on that date.</P>
        <P>One of the agreed reforms at undergraduate level involves the introduction of a new graduate entry programme for medicine from 2007, as part of the overall expansion of medical places for Irish and EU students from 305 to 725 places over a four year period. At the request of the president of the University of Limerick, I met a delegation from the university on 30 January 2006. The purpose of the meeting was to brief me on the uni<Col N="2067"/>versity&rsquo;s proposal for the provision of a new graduate entry programme in medical education. Responsibility for decisions as to the appropriate arrangements for the provision of graduate entry programmes will rest with the Higher Education Authority. I understand that, in accordance with the recent Government decision on the Fottrell and Buttimer reports, the authority will issue shortly a call for proposals for the provision of new graduate entry programmes from 2007.</P>

This funding was provided to allow the Health Service Executive to further progress the implementation of the recommendations made by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in respect of these services. The Comhairle report, which has been published, recommended significant enhancement of services, including the appointment of additional consultants. While reaching the full complement of consultant posts as recommended will take some time, major improvements in patient care can be achieved in the shorter term through a combination of additional consultant posts and the appointment of a number of clinical nurse specialists and allied health professionals.</P>
        <P>My Department is advised by the executive that the development of three new neurology units will commence during 2006, one in the mid-west, one in the north west and one in the south east, with the appointment of multi-disciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff. The HSE will also be investing in neurophysiology services in 2006, with the development of an innovative teleneurophysiology link between Sligo General Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.

	<P>Responsibility for the collection and reporting of waiting lists and waiting times now falls within the remit of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive of the NTPF to reply to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</P>
        <P>Data on out-patient waiting times are not collated nationally by my Department. The management of out-patient waiting lists and waiting times is, in the first instance, a matter for the Health Service Executive and the individual hospitals concerned. However, in 2005 I asked the NTPF to examine the needs of patients waiting longest on out-patient waiting lists. As a result, the NTPF set up a number of out-patient pilot projects around the country. The outcome was that approximately 4,400 persons, who had been waiting longest in a number of specialties, received consultations at out-patient level in private hospitals. The NTPF intends to expand their out-patient initiative in 2006.</P>

        <Quest>the procedures in place to guard against the possible spread of H5N1 avian flu virus to the human population; if she has satisfied herself that such procedures are adequate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied with progress on preparedness for a possible flu pandemic and with public health actions in response to a possible outbreak of avian flu in Ireland. For the sake of clarity, H5N1 avian flu is primarily a disease of birds. To date, there have been a very small number of human cases of H5N1 infection documented, in situations where there has been very close contact with infected birds. There is no evidence of human to human transmission.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for controlling avian flu in birds and mammals other than humans. That Department has put in place a range of measures aimed at maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s avian flu-free status. The health sector&rsquo;s role with regard to avian flu relates to the human health implications that would arise were there to be an outbreak of avian flu in this country. My Department is working very closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food in this context.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is also an active participant in my Department&rsquo;s influenza pandemic expert group. A sub-group of the expert group has developed guidance documents for use in the event of an avian influenza outbreak in animals in Ireland. Guidance on the investigation and management of suspected human cases of avian influenza has also been developed and circulated within the health system. These guidance documents are available on the HSE health protection surveillance centre website, <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The overall aims of influenza pandemic planning are to reduce mortality and morbidity and to minimise the resulting disruption to society. In line with information and evidence available internationally, my Department has consistently stated that the consequences of a global pandemic are likely to be serious. Pandemic planning can only mitigate the effects.</P>
        <P>I would like to draw a very clear distinction between the current avian flu outbreak and the possibility of a future pandemic influenza in the human population. Experts advise that such a pandemic may arise as a result of the current <Col N="2072"/>H5N1 avian flu situation, but this is by no means inevitable. My Department and the Health Service Executive are working closely together on pandemic planning. This work is ongoing on a number of fronts, as follows: the influenza pandemic expert group is updating expert guidance; the pandemic influenza operational response plan is being updated in line with the most up to date expert advice.</P>
        <P>This work is being progressed through working or implementation groups established by the HSE to address actions within the following functional areas &mdash; surveillance, health services, public health measures, vaccines and antivirals etc., communications, laboratories and materials management. My Department is a member of the HSE steering group and is also actively involved in the vaccines and antivirals and communications groups. My Department has established a standing interdepartmental committee to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of an influenza pandemic.</P>
        <P>Arrangements have been made to procure a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine for key health care workers and other essential workers. My Department is also actively pursuing an advanced purchase order for a pandemic strain vaccine. We are stockpiling 1 million treatment packs of the antiviral drug, Tamiflu. Some 600,000 packs have already been delivered. The remaining 400,000 packs will be delivered this year. Arrangements have also been made to purchase a supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient oseltamivir phosphate powder to treat children aged between one to five years of age. Arrangements are also being finalised for the stockpiling of additional supplies of the other suitable antiviral drug, Relenza.</P>

	<P>My Department is in ongoing discussions with the Health Service Executive with regard to the need for improvement in the accident and emergency services, with a particular focus on reducing the numbers on trolleys and the waiting times for patients in individual hospitals. There is a need to build on the existing action plan for accident and emergency services and, in particular, to adopt a more focused approach that concentrates on individual hospital performance. Arising from the discussions with the HSE, a number of proposals have been agreed, including provision for specific perform<Col N="2073"/>ance improvement targets for individual hospitals.</P>
        <P>I am also of the opinion that media debates about the differences in numbers between the trolley count taken by the HSE and that taken by the INO add no value. Accordingly, it has been agreed that the HSE trolley count will in future be undertaken at the same time as the INO count, that is, at 8 a.m., as well as at the normal time of 2 p.m.</P>

	<P>The report of the national task force on obesity, Obesity the Policy Challenges, was presented to the Taoiseach in May 2005. The report contains 93 recommendations aimed at tackling overweight and obesity. These relate to actions across six broad sectors: high-level Government; education; social and community; health; food, commodities, production and supply, and the physical environment.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;3 million has been made available to the Health Service Executive to support the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. The strategic planning and reform implementation of the Heath Service Executive have approved the following projects to take place this year: expanding the healthy food made easy programme; recruiting four physical activity officers to target obesity in all settings, providing four specialist community dietitian posts for obesity and weight management to support all initiatives; the procurement of equipment for growth monitoring; and further progress work with the food service sector on healthy food provision.</P>
        <P>A multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary approach is required to implement the recommendations arising from a range of health promotion policies including the report of the national task force on obesity, which was launched in May 2005. The Department is currently considering how this approach could be advanced.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated.</P>
        <P>The HSE advises that it has a system in place to notify the appropriate authorities with regard to missing children or young people. The largest number of the young people reported missing were residing in the eastern region, where there is an agreed template for reporting such an occurrence to the Garda, who are responsible for investigating. This template includes a photograph and physical description. The following agencies and personnel are also notified: Garda National Immigration Bureau, which monitors overall patterns and provide relevant information to local garda&iacute;; child care manager, for circulation to CCM colleagues nationally; supt. community welfare officer, asylum seekers unit, for flagging on the national social welfare record system; Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, for circulation to other relevant asylum process agencies.</P>
        <P>The child&rsquo;s name is added to the missing persons database in the separate children seeking asylum office. In some Garda districts, there are now regular reviews of missing children. At present the majority of separated children seeking asylum are accommodated in hostel type accommodation. This type of accommodation provides full board but does not include child care supports. Staffing levels reflect the need to meet minimum standards under fire safely legislation and do not include professional child care staff as part of the contract with proprietors. The specific child care and child protection elements of the service are provided by a dedicated social work team.</P><Col N="2075"/>
        <P>I can advise that, on 7 December 2005, my office met with the social services inspectorate and the HSE to discuss the issue of accommodation standards for separated children seeking asylum. It was agreed at the meeting that the standards for children in residential care will apply to accommodation for separated children 16 years of age and under. With regard to accommodation for those in the 17 to 18 year age group the same standards will apply, subject to guidance notes which are being drafted by the SSI in consultation with the HSE.</P>
        <P>I am also advised by the HSE that currently there are a number of separated children in foster care and these arrangements are very satisfactory in terms of the service provided and the level of support offered to the children who benefit from them. In most cases these placements are taken up by the youngest or otherwise most vulnerable of the client group. In addition, six children are accommodated in a fully registered children&rsquo;s home in Tallaght. These children are cared for by a full, professionally qualified child care staff.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the HSE commissioned a review of services provided to separated children seeking asylum or unaccompanied minors in 2005. I have received a copy of this report which is under examination in my office and in that regard I have asked that an interdepartmental working group be established to consider the issues involved.</P>

        <P>I recently met with representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of my wish to have the programme rolled out nationally as quickly as possible. For this to happen, essential elements of the roll out must be in place including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes. I have made additional revenue funding of &euro;2.3 million available to BreastCheck this year to provide among other things for the early recruitment and training of staff. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of 2007 for the commencement of roll out to southern and western regions will be met; a more exact date for roll out will depend on the availability of adequately trained medical and technical staff, particularly radiographers.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck recently interviewed for clinical directors for both regions and is in the process of making appointments. BreastCheck is also recruiting radiographers and a second consultant radiologist for each region. BreastCheck also recently received planning permission for the screening unit at University College Hospital Galway and is now proceeding to tender for its construction. BreastCheck is awaiting planning permission for the unit at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 112 together.</P>
        <P>Information supplied to my Department by the primary care reimbursement service of the Health Service Executive, HSE, for February 2006 indicates there are 1,159,794 persons covered for services under the general medical services scheme who are medical holders, representing approximately 28% of the estimated current national population. This is 14,711 higher than the HSE&rsquo;s figure for January 2006, which represents December 2005 activity. A further 9,984 people currently hold general practitioner, GP, visit cards.</P>
        <P>Since 2005 I have made significant improvements to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. In January 2005, I increased the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications by 7.5%. In June 2005, I simplified the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. This is much fairer to applicants.</P>
        <P>I announced on 13 October 2005 that the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now <Col N="2079"/>29% higher than they were at the end of 2004. It will be noted that the income assessment guidelines based for GP visit cards are 25% higher than those used for medical cards. The HSE has publicised these changes to encourage people to apply and has made the application process as simple as possible.</P>
        <P>In December 2005, my Department asked the HSE to take account of the welfare, taxation and other changes announced in the budget on the operation of the income guidelines and to identify any changes which may be required in order to ensure that medical cards and GP visit cards continue to be available to those who need them. The HSE has recently responded and its report is under consideration. My Department and the HSE will continue to monitor the number of cards issued and will examine any further changes to ensure the targets of an additional 30,000 medical cards and the provision of 200,000 GP visit cards are met.</P>

However, within this specialty there are some treatments of a very specialised nature requiring the skills of specific consultant neurosurgeons and multidisciplinary teams and for reasons of complexity these cases are best treated within the public sector.</P>
        <P>To date, over 500 people have been referred for neurosurgical procedures under the NTPF. The majority have been referred to private hospitals in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. A small number have received treatment in Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the national childcare investment programme from 2006 to 2010 is being implemented by the newly established office of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. This programme builds on the success of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06, EOCP, which will conclude in 2007. The new programme aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services that are grounded in an understanding of local child care needs.</P>
        <P>To achieve this approach arrangements are being put in place with the city and county child care committees, CCCs, to facilitate the initial development stage of applications for grant assistance for child care facilities at local level. Both private and community-not for profit sector child care providers may apply for capital funding under the new programme by completing expression of interest forms, which will be available from their local CCCs. The CCCs will provide the necessary assistance to applicants in developing their application to the pre-appraisal stage.</P>
        <P>At the appropriate stage in the process applications will be forwarded by the CCCs to Pobal, which administers the programme on behalf of the office of Minister of State with special responsibility for children. Pobal will carry out a technical appraisal of the applications and make recommendations to the office. Decisions on the applications will be made by the office within the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Private sector child care providers may apply for grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 towards the capital cost of developing a child care service in <Col N="2082"/>a catchment area where there is a demonstrated child care need. An applicant may apply for more than one grant under this scheme provided the subsequent child care facilities are in different catchment areas and subject to an overall ceiling of &euro;500,000 per applicant. In each case, an applicant must provide at least 25% of the total cost of the project. All grant payments will be subject to the relevant criteria having been met, including demonstrated local need, quality of the proposal and value for money. Community-not for profit child care providers may apply for grant assistance up to a maximum of &euro;1 million per project. Expression of interest forms will be available later this month. In the meantime existing applications will continue to be processed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, was launched on 24 January 2006. The report proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems. It proposes a person centred treatment approach that addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice and evolved and agreed with service users and their carers. Special emphasis is given to the need to involve service users and their families and carers at every level of service provision.</P>
        <P>This policy envisions an active, flexible and community based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. It will require substantial funding but there is considerable equity in buildings and lands within the current mental health system, which could be realised to fund this plan. Therefore, this report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service. The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.</P><Col N="2083"/>
        <P>The Health Service Executive, which has primary responsibility for implementing the recommendations of the expert report, has stated the national mental health directorate within the HSE will immediately establish an implementation group to ensure that the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner. I will also shortly appoint a group at national level, as recommended in the report, to monitor the implementation of its recommendations.</P>

	<P>The National Service Plan 2006 of the Health Service Executive provides a commitment to develop proposals to support patients who have to travel long distances to access specialist services, with particular focus in 2006 on those travelling for radiotherapy treatment. I approved this plan in December and it was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas last month. I made available an additional &euro;9 million to the executive for developments in cancer services in 2006, <i>inter alia</i>, to facilitate better access to radiation oncology services, including dedicated transport arrangements. The Deputy&rsquo;s question also relates to the management and delivery of health and personal, social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993 provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds. General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regu<Col N="2088"/>lations 1993 and as amended by the 2005 regulations.</P>
        <P>Under the regulations the Health Service Executive, when considering an application for subvention, carries out a means test which takes into account the means of the applicant and his or her spouse or cohabiting partner, where appropriate, and the assets of the applicant. The means test is carried out by the Health Service Executive and involves looking at the applicant&rsquo;s income for the previous 12 months. Income from all sources is taken into account and is assessed net of PRSI, income tax and the health contribution and the income of a married or cohabiting person is taken to be half the total income of the couple. In assessing an applicant&rsquo;s assets the first &euro;11,000 of such assets is disregarded. The HSE may refuse to pay a subvention if an applicant has assets exceeding &euro;36,000, excluding their principal residence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the principal private residence of an applicant, the HSE imputes an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or in receipt of a social welfare pension or allowance as set out in the 2005 regulations.</P>
        <P>The HSE may refuse to pay a subvention if the value of the applicant&rsquo;s principal residence is in excess of &euro;500,000 or more, where the residence is located in the Dublin area, or &euro;300,000 or more, where the residence is located outside the Dublin area, and the residence is not occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full time education, or a relative in receipt of a social welfare pension or allowance as set out in the 2005 regulations.</P>

	<P>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre collects data on MRSA bacteraemia, also known as bloodstream infection or blood poisoning, for the purposes of the surveillance, prevention and control of MRSA as part of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System. The European system, which collects data on the first episode of bloodstream infection per patient per quarter, was designed to allow comparison of antimicrobial resistance data between countries and possibly regions but not between hospitals. The Irish data for the system, which is published on a quarterly basis by the HPSC, showed that 553 cases of MRSA were reported in 2004. The figure for the first nine months of 2005 is 454. Ireland will participate this year in the Hospital Infection Society&rsquo;s prevalence survey of health care-associated infections, to be carried out in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The survey will give the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive accurate and comparable data on the prevalence of health care-associated infections including MRSA in acute hospitals in Ireland. The data gathered from hospitals can be compares with similar data obtained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</P>

	<P>The report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, which was launched on 24 January last, outlines an active, flexible and community-based mental health service in which the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. Such a policy would require substantial funding. As there is considerable equity in buildings and lands in the mental health system that could be realised to fund the plan, the report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to reinvest the resources released by such closures in the mental health service. The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, along with the expansion of community services, has been the policy of the Government since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change recommends that a four-stage process be pursued to effect the closure of psychiatric hospitals. First, the measures required to enable admission to cease should be identified and put in place. Second, admissions to the hospital should be ceased and plans for the relocation of existing patients should be drawn up. Third, plans for the relocation of existing patients should be implemented. Fourth, the hospital should be finally closed. The report emphasises that the process should take place on a phased basis with wards closing sequentially. The Health Service Executive anticipates that the closure of mental hospitals and the reinvestment of the proceeds will take place on a phased basis. It has emphasised that hospitals can close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings, such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres. There will also have to be a substantial increase in the number of the well-trained, fully staffed, community-based and multi-disciplinary community mental health teams, in line with the recommendation in A Vision for Change.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health and Children is responsible for health policy and will continue to be accountable to the Oireachtas in that regard. The Health Service Executive, which is the national body with statutory responsibility under the Health Act 2004 for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, will be involved in informing the making of policy by the Minister. The 2004 Act, which provided for the establishment of the Health Service Executive on a statutory basis, contains a number of provisions to ensure that the HSE is accountable to the Oireachtas. Under the Act, the Minister for Health and Children is required to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the HSE&rsquo;s corporate plan and service plan after he or she has approved it. The HSE&rsquo;s audited financial statements and annual report, as well as the report of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, must also be laid before the Houses. Under the Act the HSE&rsquo;s chief executive is appointed as its accounting officer. This provision requires the establishment of a separate Vote for the HSE for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts 1866 to 1998. Therefore, the chief executive is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts through the Comptroller and Auditor General for the HSE&rsquo;s appropriation accounts. The HSE is also obliged to prepare a set of income and expenditure accounts for which it is accountable to the D&aacute;il through the Committee of Public Accounts. As accounting officer, the chief executive will be required to attend a meeting of that committee. The 2004 Act also requires that the chief executive must attend an Oireachtas committee to give an account of the HSE&rsquo;s general administration, if requested to do so, and that the chief executive or any other employee of the HSE must attend an Oireachtas committee if requested to do so by the Chairman of that committee. The funding available to the HSE is determined by Government at the conclusion of the annual Estimates process. The HSE&rsquo;s Estimate &mdash; Vote 40 &mdash; is presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with the Estimates of all Departments and Government offices in abridged form in November of the preceding year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</P>
        <P>Gross current funding for the health services has increased by almost &euro;6 billion, or 92%, over the last five years. When the increases required to fund general pay increases, benchmarking and other pay awards, non-pay inflation and increases in drugs costs are taken into account, approximately &euro;1.8 billion has been provided for additional investment in services. The extra investment has provided for significant improvements in our health system across all of the main service areas including acute hospitals, primary care, disability, older people, mental health and child care.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>I will outline some of the key achievements. The key goal of the national cancer strategy, which was to achieve a 15% decrease in mor<Col N="2093"/>tality from cancer in the under-65 age group, was achieved three years ahead of target. There have been significant increases in cancer related services, particularly day care and inpatient treatments. BreastCheck had screened approximately 185,000 women by the end of 2004. The immediate benefits of the implementation of the Building Healthier Hearts strategy are evident. I refer, for example, to the increase of 153% in certain cardiology procedures, including forms of surgery, between 1999 and 2004. There were over 1 million inpatient and day case discharges from acute hospitals in 2005. This is equivalent to the population of Dublin, or to 2,900 patients being discharged every day. Over 38,000 people have been treated under the National Treatment Purchase Fund. The number of inpatient beds and day treatment places in acute hospitals has increased by over 1,100 in the past five years.</P>
        <P>Since the end of 2001, there have been increases, in wholetime equivalent terms of 924, or 14.7%, in the number of medical and dental personnel, of 3,449, or 11%, in the number of nurses and of 4,428, or 49%, in the numbers of health and social care professionals. Some 28% of the population was in receipt of a medical card at the end of last year. All people aged 70 and over have had a statutory entitlement to a medical card since July 2001. One of the most significant developments in general practice in recent years has been the advent of out-of-hours general practitioner co-operatives, which allow medical card and private patients to access appropriate qualified medical care out of hours, including domiciliary visits where deemed appropriate, simply by dialling a lo-call telephone number. An initial ten primary care teams have been established under the primary care strategy. The allocation of additional funding for services for older people has allowed for an extra 2,000 home care packages, which constitutes a trebling of the current service. Increases in such funding have also provided for an additional 1.75 million home help hours in 2006 and in excess of 1,325 extra places per week in day or respite care centres. Some 97% of those registered in the national intellectual disability database &mdash; 24,078 people &mdash; were receiving services in 2005. The relevant figure in 2002 was 91%.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P>The current national development plan has provided for significant improvements in capital investment in infrastructure across all health care programmes. The new developments range from major projects to minor capital works such as refurbishment, re-equipping, maintenance and health and safety. Along with some service developments, they underpin the delivery of a modern, high-quality health service across the country. I will make some international comparisons on public health spending. In 2002, which is the latest year for which comparable data is available, <Col N="2094"/>Ireland&rsquo;s publicly funded health expenditure <i>per capita</i> was $1,779 in purchasing power parities. This is above the average of 14 of the 15 pre-accession EU member states surveyed in the OECD database. It ranks Ireland eighth among these 14 EU countries in terms of <i>per capita</i> public spending on health. Furthermore, the latest OECD figures indicate that public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP increased by 14.6% from 4.8% in 1997 to 5.5% in 2002. Based on the methodology agreed with the OECD for the calculation of comparable health expenditure statistics, however, it is reasonable to project that Ireland&rsquo;s public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP for 2006 will be approximately<?oasys _jy ?>6%, which is a significant improvement and clearly demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the health service.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The numbers above have been rounded to the nearest 100 as appropriate. The numbers of income earners for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 are based on actual data for 2002 projected forward in accordance with macro-economic data relating to actual and expected growth in incomes and employment. A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not have a policy of switching people with mixed PAYE and other income to a self-assessment basis. Whether an individual comes within the self-assessment system is determined by whether they are deemed a &ldquo;chargeable person&rdquo; under section 950 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. An individual whose income is derived solely from PAYE is excluded from self-assessment. However, an individual having both PAYE and non-PAYE income is strictly within the self-assessment system. For ease of administration, Revenue accepts that an individual whose net income from non-PAYE sources is &euro;3,174 or less will continue to be taxed under PAYE and the non-PAYE <Col N="2096"/>income will be &ldquo;coded in&rdquo; against their tax credits.</P>
        <P>Section 14 of the Finance Act 2005 amended the definition of a &ldquo;chargeable person&rdquo; for self-assessment purposes. This permits Revenue the discretion to look at an individual&rsquo;s gross non-PAYE income when deciding on assessment status.</P>
        <P>For the 2005 tax year and subsequent years of assessment, substantial gross income is defined as gross non-PAYE income of &euro;50,000 or more, for example, gross income from a trade or profession, gross rental income, dividends and distributions or foreign income and so on. An individual with PAYE income who also has substantial gross income from a non-PAYE source, but where this income has been reduced to nil or to a negligible amount because of deductions, losses, allowances and other reliefs, is regarded as a &ldquo;chargeable person&rdquo; and is required to make a return under the self-assessment system.</P>
        <P>Except as outlined above, there is no change to the practice for individuals whose main source of income is subject to PAYE but who have assessable non-PAYE income of less than &euro;3,174. These individuals can continue to have the liability on such income effectively assessed within PAYE by means of coding in the income against their tax credits. An individual with assessable non-PAYE income of more than &euro;3,174 for any year is regarded as a &ldquo;chargeable person&rdquo; for self-assessment purposes and must file a Form 11 for that year. There are no indications that this practice has influenced the upward trend in the number of people who are taxed under the self-assessment system.</P>

        <Quest>the trend in tax relief on donations for the PAYE sector and self-assessed sector over the past five years; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the much more generous way of crediting tax relief on PAYE than on self-assessed has resulted in declining charity revenue when taxpayers become self-assessed.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The current scheme for tax relief on donations to approved bodies, which includes donations made to charities, is governed by section 848(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and claims under the scheme arose from 2002 onwards. Arrangements for allowing tax relief for donations depend on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer or an individual on self-assessment, or a company. For a PAYE taxpayer, the relief is given on a grossed-up basis to the approved body rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. For example, if an individual who pays income tax at the higher rate gives a donation of &euro;580 to an approved body, the body will be deemed to have received &euro;1,000 less tax <Col N="2097"/>of &euro;420. The approved body, such as a charity, will therefore be able to claim a refund of &euro;420 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year. Similarly, if a standard rate taxpayer makes a donation of &euro;800 to an approved body, the approved body will be able to claim a refund of &euro;200 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year.</P>
        <P>In the case of a donation made by an individual who pays tax on a self-assessment basis and by companies, it is the donor and not the recipient of the donation who claims the relief. For example, if a self-assessed individual who pays tax at the higher rate gives a donation of &euro;1,000 to <Col N="2098"/>an approved body, the donor will be able to claim a refund of &euro;420 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year. The donation can be claimed as a deduction against the individual&rsquo;s income from all sources. The claim to the relief is made with the individual&rsquo;s normal tax return. There is a presumption that potential donors will be aware of the tax relief available and how it will be applied in particular cases, and that the level of the donation will reflect that knowledge.</P>
        <P>The following figures cover the cost to the Exchequer of the scheme for donations to approved bodies for the years 2002 to 2005, inclusive.</P><Col N="2097"/>

        <P FLI="0">With regard to figures for donations by self-assessed donors, the only data available is for the tax year 2002. In that year 5,885 self-assessed donors made claims under the terms of the scheme, at a cost of &euro;5.1 million to the Exchequer. Preliminary information on the tax year 2003 indicates that the figures will be of a similar order. There is no evidence of a reduction in charity revenue, as suggested by the Deputy. The reduction in the amount donated in 2004 compared with 2003 is due to the introduction in the Finance Act 2003 of a maximum limit on the amount of a donation that can attract relief where the donation is made by an individual to a charity or approved body with which he or she is associated. In such a case, where the aggregate of donations to any one charity or approved body in a year is in excess of 10% of the individual&rsquo;s total income, the excess does not attract tax relief.</P>
        <P>The scheme of tax relief for donations to charities and approved bodies was one of the schemes reviewed as part of the internal review of certain tax schemes carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners last year. The review recommended that no change be made to the structure of the scheme at this stage.</P>

        <P>In order to progress matters on Question No. 217, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor stated that proceedings would be re-entered into the High Court on behalf of the Minister for Finance, on the basis of information available to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor at this time. This matter was discussed by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, in liaison with the Office of the Attorney General. At that time, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor was on notice that another party disputed the State&rsquo;s entitlement to the lands in question, but had not at that time submitted evidence of their claim.</P>
        <P>With regard to the other parliamentary question, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor received a sworn affidavit from another party stating its claim for adverse possession against the company. On the basis of this new information, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, advised that it would now appear that the property may not now have been vested in the Minister for Finance. For the avoidance of any doubt and without necessarily accepting that the property or any part of it has vested in the Minister for Finance, the State is now considering waiving whatever interest it has, if any, to this party.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium negotiated a treaty some years back to facilitate the exchange of driver and vehicle registration information between the participants through an electronic system, known as EUCARIS. The treaty has quite a narrow scope and its aim is to identify and prevent international trade in stolen vehicles and to identify stolen and fraudulent driving licences within the treaty area. To date, three of the five founding countries, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, have ratified the treaty. Until one more of the original five countries ratifies the treaty, it is not open to other countries to accede and accordingly the question of full participation by Ireland does not arise at present.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Revenue Commissioners, responsible for vehicle registration, have observer status and are following the work closely. The Revenue Commissioners are taking account of the structures established in accordance with the provisions of Council Decision 2004/919/EC on tackling vehicle crime with cross-border implications, which was adopted during the Irish Presidency of the EU; the existing mutual assistance provisions which already provide very significant <Col N="2106"/>exchange of information procedures; and the existing structures in EUROPOL and INTERPOL, whose specific stolen vehicle database is used extensively by the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners will consider in due course, in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, whether extra advantages are to be gained by full participation in the EUCARIS.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of the need for early traffic reduction measures to coincide with the inevitable traffic disruption of Transport 21, he will provide special tax incentives, similar to the tax saver scheme, for users of van pools.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8757/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Revenue Commissioners advise me that under their published guidelines for the operation of PAYE and PRSI for certain benefits there is no charge to tax in respect of a van which is in a &ldquo;van pool&rdquo;. A van can be treated by an employer as being in a van pool if: the van is made available to, and is actually used by, more than one employee and is not ordinarily used by one employee to the exclusion of the others; any private use of the van by the employees is merely incidental to business use; it is not normally kept overnight at the home of any of the employees.</P>
        <P>I assume that the reference by the Deputy to the tax saver scheme relates to the commuter travel saver scheme. An exemption from taxation as a benefit-in-kind was provided for certain commuter travel passes given to employees by employers. The main reason for introducing this exemption was to underpin Government policy on the wider use of public transport and it was hoped these exemptions would encourage commuters who travelled to and from work by car to switch to public transport, thereby easing traffic congestion at peak times. Further tax incentives for van pools would not contribute to the move to public transport and I have no plans to introduce such special tax incentives.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 116 and 151 on 16 November 2005, where I indicated that the Government&rsquo;s broadband target for Ireland is to be within the top half of EU countries in terms of broadband penetration by the end of 2007, and not a specific position. In a liberalised telecommunications market, the rate of broadband take-up will be largely determined by the private sec<Col N="2109"/>tor service providers supplying and marketing broadband products to meet the requirements of end-users.</P>
        <P>Take-up targets after 2007 have not been set because they would not address the immediate needs of broadband in Ireland. With regard to the provision of broadband, that is, the availability or coverage of broadband services, internationally comparable benchmarks are not widely used and it is, therefore, difficult to establish international rankings.</P>

        <Quest>when the Marine Institute report comparing EU log book data and the results of scientific surveys was provided to him; and when and the way in which it was conveyed to the European Commission.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Marine Institute formally reported to the Department in October 2005 that it had wide ranging data from its scientific work which showed a consistent high level of illegal landings by whitefish boats in respect of trips where Marine Institute staff were on board the vessel. The report was submitted by the chief executive of the Marine Institute to the Secretary General of my Department on 26 October 2005 and was forwarded to me the following day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following consideration of the matter by the Government and once the advice of the Attorney General had been received, the then Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, wrote to Dr. Joe Borg, the EU Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, seeking a meeting to discuss this and other matters relating to possible illegal fishing. I, together with Minister of State, Deputy Browne, met the Commissioner on 20 February 2006 and presented him with the report, excluding an appendix which listed individual fishing vessels by name. In this regard I wish to clarify to the House, regarding my contribution on Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il on the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 on 22 February 2006, that the Marine Institute&rsquo;s find<Col N="2120"/>ings were not sent directly to the Commission by the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>At the meeting on 20 February we also outlined to the Commissioner the measures which the Government has taken, and which it plans to take, to substantially strengthen fisheries control and to address this very serious issue. These measures, of which the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill is a critical part, are vital to place the fishing industry on a sustainable, legally secure and equitable footing for the future.</P>

	<P>Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs on 29 September 2004, I made the following board appointments. The advisory board of Ireland Aid was established in August 2002. The name of the board was subsequently changed to the Advisory Board for Development Co-operation Ireland in September 2003.

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>his views on whether Irish consumers are currently being ripped off due to the ever increasing practice by retailers of labelling goods in both euro and sterling prices; his further views on whether there is a serious problem in this regard and legislation is necessary; if this problem will be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>There is an obligation to display the selling price of a product under regulation 4 of Statutory Instrument No. 639 of 2002 [European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations, 2002]. The regulations stipulate that the indication of the selling price be &ldquo;unambiguous, easily identifiable as referring to that product, clearly visible and <Col N="2136"/>legible to prospective customers and in proximity to the product, or in the case of a product for sale by distance contract, to the description of the product&rdquo;. There is nothing in the legislation which forbids the indication of sterling prices on products. However, I accept that difficulties can arise for consumers if a sterling price is shown more prominently than the price in euros. This can be misleading and is not in keeping with the spirit of the legislation. Neither is it in keeping with Government policy that consumers be in a position to make informed choices before proceeding to complete a transaction.</P>
        <P>I am reviewing the operation of these regulations and will be seeking legal advice on the issue of dual pricing. I will keep the Deputy informed on any proposed changes in the legislation.</P>

        <Quest>if the <Col N="2137"/>decision to refuse work permits to a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary will be reviewed as two separate advertisements with F&Aacute;S callnet service failed to elicit any applications for the vacant positions; the alternative efforts this employer is required to make in order to fulfil the conditions for obtaining work permits for non-EU nationals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>IDA Ireland is an autonomous statutory agency set up under the Industrial Development Acts 1986 to 2003. The agency <Col N="2138"/>operates in accordance with the provisions of the Acts and under the aegis of my Department. The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio, including the purchase and disposal of property, is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas and not a matter in which I have any function.</P>
        <P>I understand, however, that the IDA is currently at the advanced stage of negotiations with the owners of the factory premises at Ballinrobe, County Mayo with a view to making the property &mdash; the building and associated lands &mdash; available for further development. Meanwhile, the building and associated lands continue to be available for marketing purposes for appropriate projects interested in locating in County Mayo.</P>

	<P>The person concerned was awarded disability benefit from 15 February 1996. Her claim was disallowed from 23 February 2004 after she was found capable of work by a medical assessor of the Department. She appealed against the disallowance and she was examined by a different medical assessor who also considered her to be capable of work. Her case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow disability benefit. She was notified of this decision on 19 January 2005.</P><Col N="2152"/>
        <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 23 February 2004 until her entitlement to unemployment benefit was exhausted on 21 May 2005. She signed for unemployment credits until 29 October 2005. No application for disability or unemployment payments has been received since that date. The person concerned would not qualify for payment of disability benefit at this time as she does not have the required number of recent reckonable PRSI contributions. However, she will qualify for the award of credited contributions which could help to qualify her for benefit in the future.</P>
        <P>Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged 16 or over and under age 66. The disability must be expected to last for a least one year and the allowance is subject to both a medical assessment and a means test. A disability allowance claim form was issued to the person concerned on 28 February 2006. To apply for same, she should complete the claim form and return it to the Department. Her case will then be examined and she will be notified of the outcome accordingly.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, if her means are not sufficient to meet her needs, the person concerned should contact the community welfare officer at her local Health Service Executive office who will advise her of her possible entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Ring</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will be approved and awarded rent supplement; if his staff will be directed to award rent supplement to people in full-time education and in similar circumstances.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8686/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Rent supplements are available to eligible people through the supplementary welfare <Col N="2153"/>allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. Neither I nor my Department has any function in determining entitlement in individual cases.</P>
        <P>Section 190(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides that people in full-time education are not normally eligible to receive assistance, including rent supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Section 190(3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 and regulations made thereunder provide that in a case where there are exceptional circumstances, supplementary welfare allowance may be granted to a person who would qualify other than for their exclusion under section 190(1). This discretion is aimed at enabling assistance to be provided through the scheme if necessary to people who face an exceptional non-recurring cost which they cannot meet from their own resources. This exceptional needs provision is not intended to circumvent existing standard rules for other schemes. The executive has previously advised that, in its opinion, there are no special circumstances in this case to merit payment of assistance on an exceptional basis.</P>
        <P>The position therefore remains the same to that given in my response to a question from the Deputy on 23 February 2006. The executive has advised that in considering her application for rent supplement in her college location, it has thoroughly examined all information available to it in relation to the circumstances of the person concerned and has determined that she is not eligible on the basis that she is a full-time student. It has further advised that this decision has been upheld by the executive&rsquo;s designated appeals officer.</P>

In addition, the Pensions Ombudsman comes under the remit of my Department. Appointments made to these agencies since 1 March 2001 are outlined in the following tables.</P>
        <P>The Pensions Board was established in December 1990 under the Pensions Act 1990. The role of the board is to monitor and supervise the provisions of the Pensions Acts, as amended, relating to occupational pensions and to advise the Minister on all matters relating to its func<Col N="2154"/>tions and on matters relating to pensions generally.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the community <Col N="2157"/>welfare division of the Health Service Executive. Neither I nor my Department have any function in relation to decisions on individual claims. Under supplementary welfare allowance rules, rent supplement is not normally payable to couples where either of them is engaged in full-time employment. For these purposes, employment for 30 hours or more per week is regarded as full-time.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to this case remains the same as that given in my response to a question from the Deputy on 8 February 2006. The executive has advised that the persons concerned were refused a rent supplement on the grounds that one of the applicants was engaged in full-time employment. It is open to the persons concerned to appeal this decision to the executive&rsquo;s designated appeals officer.</P>

Any party to the agreement may also call a meeting of the joint committee to discuss questions relating to the interpretation or application of the agreement.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if it is his intention as reported to ban heavy goods vehicles including bus-coaches from the outside lane of motorways and to make them liable for penalty points or if this ban is to apply to passenger carrying vehicles.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under article 33 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, it is prohibited to drive a heavy good vehicle, a bus or coach that accommodates more than eight passengers and any vehicle that is towing a trailer etc, in the outside lane of a motorway except where it is necessary to proceed in that lane due to an obstruction or because another lane or lanes is or are for the time being closed to traffic.</P>
        <P>Those classes of vehicles are subject to a maximum, vehicle-related speed limit of 80 km/h whereas the default motorway speed limit is 120 <Col N="2159"/>km/h. This 1997 ban on driving in the outside lane of motorways is included in the Schedule of offences listed in the Road Traffic Act 2002 to which the penalty points system can be applied and it is one of the 31 offences to which I propose to extend the penalty points system in April 2006. From April penalty points will be applied to the driving licence records of drivers of vehicles in the classes mentioned who are convicted in court or after payment of a fixed charge in lieu of going to court as a result of breaching this motorway driving rule.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>the statutory instrument governing the use of bus lanes; the regulation regarding the use of contra-flow bus lanes by taxis; the reason taxis are permitted to use some of these but not others; his views on whether they should be allowed to use all bus lanes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8697/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Provisions regarding the use of bus lanes are set out in articles 32 and 39 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, SI 182 of 1997, as amended in article 2 of Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 1998, SI 441 of 1998.</P>
        <P>Article 32 provides that only large public service vehicles and cyclists can enter bus lanes during the operative period and that an exception is made for a taxi or a wheel chair accessible taxi which is being used in the course of business. It is also provided that, except for the purpose of access, only large public service vehicles can enter a bus-only street. The result of this measure is that taxis and other vehicles can use a bus-only street if access to premises on that street is required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, the article provides that only a large public service vehicle can enter a contra-flow bus lane. This prohibition and single user status is based on road safety considerations and to give priority to the operation of large public service vehicles. I have no plans to permit taxis to use all bus lanes.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>the way in which the national car testing service is accountable to him; the monitoring arrangements that are in place to ensure that the service is operating in compliance with its contract and terms of operation; and if he has satisfied himself with the accountability of the service and the monitoring arrangements.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">National Car Testing Service Limited, NCTS, is required, under the car testing contract, to meet a range of performance standards for the service. These standards, which are designed to ensure test integrity and a high level of customer service, cover premises, test equipment, staff, test arrangements, facilities management, information technology and customer service.</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport monitors the performance of NCTS to ensure that it delivers the service to the required standard. To assist the <Col N="2164"/>Department in that function a supervision services contractor &mdash; a consortium involving PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Automobile Association with engineering, financial, legal, IT and operational expertise &mdash; has been engaged and is working to an agreed programme for the Department. This programme includes: detailed monthly operational audits of the company&rsquo;s performance; regular controlled checks to ensure that consistent test results are obtained across the NCTS test centre network; each month reviewing the performance of a sample of vehicle testers as they carry out tests; carrying out spot checks without any advance warning on a representative sample of cars that have just undergone the NCT; carrying out detailed interviews with a representative sample of customers to assess customer satisfaction levels; and an annual review of the company&rsquo;s overall performance.</P>
        <P>These measures ensure that the car testing service is comprehensively monitored and supervised and I am satisfied that the company is meet<Col N="2165"/>ing the performance standards set for the service in the contract.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if, in view of the need for early traffic reduction measures to coincide with the inevitable traffic disruption of Transport 21, he will seek special tax incentives, similar to the tax saver scheme, for users of van pools.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8752/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the major infrastructure projects in Transport 21 will have some traffic impact during construction and major traffic benefits once operational. The various implementing agencies are acutely conscious of the need to minimise traffic impact during construction and will develop appropriate traffic management strategies in consultation with the local authorities, as traffic authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a wider front, the Department of Transport is looking at a range of possible options for promoting a more sustainable approach to transport, including the use of fiscal incentives. If it is felt that fiscal incentives such as the one referred to by the Deputy could play a significant role in promoting sustainable solutions, proposals will be put to the Minister for Finance for consideration as part of the annual budget preparations.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Regarding An Foras Teanga, nominations to fill vacancies are made by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland authorities, with appointments being made by the North-South Ministerial Council. Mark Thompson was appointed to the Ulster-Scots Agency to fill a casual vacancy in that position with effect from 20 June 2005 and subsequently as chair of the agency, with effect from 12 October 2005. I might also mention that the term of office of all existing Foras Teanga board members was extended in December 2005 for a period of one year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The following table shows the number of tuberculosis reactors disclosed between 2002 and 2005. Ireland&rsquo;s bovine tuberculosis eradication programme comprises the comprehensive surveillance of all herds, which are tested annually, and additional risk-based testing in other herds, a proactive wildlife programme in the area of infective outbreaks, the routine application of gamma interferon assay in infected herds and full herd tests at six-monthly intervals post derestriction in respect of the latter herds for a two year period.</P>
        <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>Cattle are tested on holdings using the approved single intradermal comparative tuberculin test. The test is highly reliable with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99.9%. Cattle which react positively to the test must be deemed to be reactors for the purpose of the programme.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P>With regard to the number of reactors which are &ldquo;tuberculosis free&rdquo; at slaughter, the position <Col N="2171"/>is that many animals exposed to and infected with bovine tuberculosis are slaughtered as reactor animals without confirmation of tuberculosis, for example, the detection of visible lesions. This is normal and to be expected in a situation where <Col N="2172"/>the examination is done as part of a routine slaughter at commercial &ldquo;kill&rdquo; speeds and conditions and where tuberculin testing is conducted annually. In view of this, it is not possible to state the number of these animals which were tuberculosis free when slaughtered in the factory.</P><Col N="2171"/>

        <Quest>her plans to change the guidelines regarding the early retirement scheme; if a <Col N="2174"/>person would be able to go to the mart to sell animals on behalf of their son or do minimum farm yard duty; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU regulations governing both the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming and the early retirement, ERS2, 2000 scheme require scheme participants to cease commercial farming definitively. As work such as selling animals on behalf of a family member at a mart or carrying out work in the farm yard is considered part of normal farming activities, a retired farmer would be precluded from carrying out such work after his or her retirement.</P>
        <P>This requirement must be adhered to and is central to the operation of the scheme, and it is not open to my Department to waive it. However, in a concession secured from the European Commission, farmers who have retired under one or other of the early retirement schemes are allowed to work as insured employees in farming-related businesses. Examples of such employment would include work for co-ops and private companies that provide services to farmers on a contract basis, such as relief milking, silage making, hedge cutting and other such activities.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The revised farm waste management scheme will be introduced as soon as the required EU state aid approval is received from the EU Commission. Subject to receipt of this approval, the scheme will provide for an increase in the current standard grant rate from 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in the four zone C counties; be extended to include horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry, and mushroom compost; permit all small farmers to participate in the scheme by the removal of any minimum income requirements from farming from the scheme; and provide for an increase in the maximum eligible investment ceiling from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000. I am confident that the required EU approval will be received very shortly.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The private security authority licence fee structure reflects the variety between the different sectors of the industry and takes account of companies and employees who might be working in multiple sectors. Fees also take account of the relative size of companies operating in any given sector. Moreover, the authority is obliged to become self-financing so licence fees must reflect the overall operating costs of the authority.</P>
        <P>The two-year licence fee was set taking into account the huge variety of cost models in the various sectors of the industry. These range from low turnover but high staffing levels in the guarding sector, to lower staffing levels but higher turnover in sectors such as electronics.</P>
        <P>The private security industry itself supports regulation and has actively campaigned for it for many years. The provision of a regulatory environment for the industry will understandably lead to structured cost implications. However, it is the industry which will benefit from regulation and it is in line with Government policy that the industry should fund such a development.</P>
        <P>This matter was examined by the board of the private security authority at its meeting of 21 November 2005, which re-affirmed its previous decision with regard to the fee structure and decided that this issue would be revisited by the board in the context of a review of licensing in two years&rsquo; time.</P>

	<P>The education requirements for entry as a recruit prison officer provide that the <Col N="2176"/>applicant is qualified at Irish leaving certificate level at specified grades in mathematics and at least two languages, one of which must be English or Irish, and in not less than two other subjects.</P>
        <P>In the absence of these qualifications the merit grade in the applied leaving certificate or a qualification in another examination which is not of a lower standard than that of the Irish leaving certificate is acceptable. Such applicants must have the required standard in mathematics, two languages, one which must be English or Irish, and two other subjects.</P>
        <P>There are no arrangements currently for exempting mature persons. These education qualifications are however under review in the light of accredited training developments at recruit prison officer level and due consideration will be given in that context to whether or not specific arrangements can be adopted in respect of mature persons at future recruit competitions.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aware of the identities of a number of Irish citizens who currently reside outside this jurisdiction and are believed to be involved in criminal activity related to the drugs trade. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for the Garda authorities to be absolute about numbers but I am satisfied that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through its ongoing liaison and contacts with law enforcement agencies in other EU member states, continues to target these individuals.</P>
        <P>The persons in question choose to reside abroad for a variety of reasons, including ongoing Garda activities to counter criminal activity within the State. Although resident outside this jurisdiction, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with other law enforcement agencies, continues to target the activities of these individuals both at home and abroad through the following methods: (i) conducting targeted operations against individuals and organisations operating within this jurisdiction with known links to international criminals, including Irish nationals based abroad; <Col N="2178"/>(ii) exchanging strategic and operational intelligence with other law enforcement agencies, including Interpol and Europol, in accordance with legislation and operational protocols; and (iii) assisting EU law enforcement agencies conducting investigations of criminal activity with suspected involvement by Irish nationals by conducting inquiries in accordance with mutual legal assistance arrangements.</P>
        <P>In order to facilitate the exchange of information and intelligence between EU law enforcement agencies the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has posted liaison officers in a number of locations in Europe, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Spain, as well as at Interpol and Europol.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Section 15 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a Garda reserve and Deputies will recall that the measure won widespread support in the House during the passage of the Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have just recently received the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals for the Garda reserve and I can advise the Deputy that these proposals specifically address issues relating to the training, powers and duties of reserve members and other issues including compensation. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the detail of the proposals before I have had an opportunity to examine them closely and to consult with the Commissioner on them, as required. Following examination of the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals, I will be drawing up the necessary regulations for the approval of Government under the Act and, as part of that process, there will be consultations with the Garda representative associations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda reserve will be a supplement to, and emphatically not a replacement, for garda&iacute;. Proof of this is the current increase in the strength of the force from 12,000 to 14,000 members. This programme is well under way and will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The Garda budget is also at an all time high. This year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;1.29 billion represents an increase of 13% on the allocation for 2005. It includes provision of over &euro;83.5 million for overtime, an increase of &euro;23 million on last year&rsquo;s allocation, which will yield over 2.7 million hours of Garda overtime for front-line policing throughout the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda reserve will be a valuable additional support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It will enhance its capacity to respond to emerging policing challenges and will reinforce its links with local communities. At a time when garda&iacute; increasingly do not live in the areas that they police, the Garda reserve will be a valuable source of local strength and knowledge. The proposal for the reserve has the support of the Oireachtas and, I believe, the support of the public. I have undertaken to consult constructively with the Garda representative associations on the proposals, and I will be asking them, for their part, to undertake to respect the clear will of the Oireachtas in this matter and to engage positively in those consultations.</P>

        <P>Excluding the changeover to the PULSE system, which changed the method of collection of data, the last change to the form occurred in 1995. The National Roads Authority may propose changes to the accident report form, in consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should it feel that further data should be captured on the form.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 12 July 2005. His application was examined shortly after receipt and it was determined that he did not have the required reckonable residency and was, therefore, ineligible for naturalisation. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. In the case of a non-national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish citizen those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age; be of good character; be married to the Irish citizen for at least three years; be in a marriage recognised <Col N="2197"/>under the laws of the State as subsisting; be living together as husband and wife with the Irish spouse; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisation; and have made, before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. The individual concerned and his wife were married on 5 March 2004. The earliest he is eligible to apply for naturalisation is 5 March 2007, provided he has been resident in the island of Ireland continuously during that three-year period.</P>

	<P>On the basis that the reference number included in the details accompanying the question is a naturalisation application reference number, I have assumed the Deputy is seeking clarification regarding an application for naturalisation by the person concerned. An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person concerned was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 11 June 2004. This application was examined in February 2006 and it was determined that the individual concerned did not have appropriate reckonable residency for the purposes of naturalisation. He arrived in the State in October 1999 and obtained permission to remain for study purposes from the time of his arrival until September 2001 and for periods between March 2003 and May 2004. Time spent in the State for the purposes of study cannot be reckoned for naturalisation purposes and, consequently, at the time of his application in June 2004, the person concerned had a total of 16 months reckonable residence, well short of the necessary five years. He was informed he did not meet the statutory residency criteria by letter on 22 February last. The person concerned is still residing in the State for the purposes of study and his current permission expires on 30 September 2006. It is unlikely, therefore, that he will be eligible for naturalisation in the near future.</P>

I reiterate that I am not disputing this person&rsquo;s medical reports presented by her legal representative, the Refugee Legal Service, but medical reasons alone are not criteria under the Dublin II regulation for processing her asylum claim in Ireland. As I stated in my previous replies, this person&rsquo;s transfer will be dealt with in a sympathetic and humane way when she is discharged from hospital. Her medical needs will be fully taken account of in arranging the transfer. In this regard, I have requested her legal representative to keep the Garda national immigration bureau informed of her up-to-date medical condition and whereabouts for the purpose of arranging the transfer. If necessary, medical escorts to accompany her on the flight will be provided. The Belgian authorities will also be notified in advance of her condition so that suitable reception arrangements can be made for her.</P>

The child in question was born on 10 March 2004, but neither of the parents has submitted evidence of continuous residence from that time until the date they submitted their applications in March 2005.

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 14 April 1998 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by asylum division of my Department and, on appeal, by the appeals authority. Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 17 August 2000 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made; or consenting to the making of a <Col N="2200"/>deportation order. Representations setting out reasons he should not be deported were subsequently received. I expect the case file in this matter to be submitted to me shortly for decision. This decision will be taken having regard to considerations specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. These considerations include matters relating to the common good, the person&rsquo;s family and domestic circumstances, as well as humanitarian considerations. Consideration will also be given to the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i> which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 1 February 2006. The average processing time for an application for naturalisation is 24 months. However, the person referred to by the Deputy is a minor. Due to the fact that such applications are more straightforward than standard adult applications, it is usually possible to finalise them in a shorter period. Based on current processing trends, it is likely that the application on behalf of the person concerned will be finalised in or around the end of this year. I will be in touch with the Deputy and the applicant when I have reached a decision in the matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 to 227, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of the cost of insurance incurred by individual primary and secondary schools as it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability.</P>
        <P>Funding is provided to primary and secondary schools by way of <i>per capita</i> grants, which afford schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to primary and post-primary schools. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil to &euro;133.58 with effect from 1 January 2005 and has recently been further increased by &euro;12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2006, bringing the standard rate to &euro;145.58. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level since 1997.</P>
        <P>At second level, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant, which stood at &euro;256 per pupil in the school year <Col N="2203"/>2001-02, has been increased by a further &euro;12 to &euro;298 per pupil from January 2006. Under the school services support fund initiative, secondary schools will also benefit from the further significant increases. The grant that was increased for secondary schools from &euro;131 per pupil in January 2005 to &euro;145 per pupil, has been increased by a further &euro;14 per pupil to &euro;159 per pupil from January 2006. These grants are in addition to the <i>per capita</i> funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. A secondary school with 500 pupils now receives annual grants of up to &euro;270,000 towards general expenses and support services as against annual grants of up to &euro;237,000 in 2002.</P>
        <P>These significant increases in the funding of primary and post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the average waiting period for admission and children born outside the State and children who do not have English as their first language is not available as schools are not required to return this information to my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This <Col N="2204"/>represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil teacher ratio in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under the action plan for tackling disadvantage published in 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>
        <P>Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next two years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools. The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that, with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on. The general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this will be reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. The circular outlining the revised staffing schedule is being finalised. It is expected that the circular will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website this week. Hard copies of the circular will be printed and issued to all primary schools as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
        <P>Schools will be asked to use the extra class teachers provided as a result of the revised schedule to provide for smaller classes in the junior grades.</P>
        <P>In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done this. Now, in line with the <Col N="2205"/>Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the free fees initiative my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students. The main conditions are that students must be first-time undergraduates and hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.</P>
        <P>The candidate referred to by the Deputy does not satisfy the eligibility conditions for the free fees initiative and is therefore liable for the cost of the tuition fees on her chosen course.</P>
        <P>I emphasise the distinction between the criteria that determines eligibility under the free fees initiative and the criteria by which individual third level institutions establish what rates of tuition fees should be charged in cases where a student does not qualify for free fees. The third level institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, may determine the level of fees to be charged in any cases where the free fees initiative does not apply.</P>
        <P>I advise the Deputy of the provisions under section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This section provides tax relief for eligible persons, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU member states and postgraduate courses in non-EU countries.</P>
        <P>Tax relief at undergraduate level extends to approved full and part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges in the State and any other EU member state and approved full and part-time courses operated by colleges in any EU member State providing distance education in the State.</P>
        <P>In 2001, section 29 of the 2001 Finance Act amended the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to <Col N="2208"/>provide for the amalgamation of the then existing four tax reliefs for third level education fees. The section also extended the relief by removing the restrictions for repeat years, for individuals undertaking more than one course and for those already holding a third level qualification. It also removed the exclusion of certain courses in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training. The relief is also extended to postgraduate fees paid for third level education in private and publicly funded third level colleges in non-EU countries. Tax relief for undergraduate fees is also now available in EU countries for duly accredited private third level colleges.</P>
        <P>Tax relief on tuition fees is claimed directly from the tax office using an IT 31 form. Details of approved colleges and courses are also available on Revenue&rsquo;s website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Approved undergraduate courses must be of at least two years' duration and both the college and the course must satisfy the codes of standards as laid down by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>It is the Department&rsquo;s policy to seek to encourage and facilitate the participation of people with disabilities on programmes offered in the further <Col N="2209"/>education sector. It is acknowledged, however, that while further education programmes are open to people with disabilities, the supports required to enable them to access these options are in need of further development. Generally, issues of access for individuals to further education programmes are addressed at local level.</P>
        <P>In December 2005, special grants were provided by my Department to vocational education committees to upgrade services through the purchase of equipment and materials, refurbishment and minor structural works to enhance the provision for students with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme is primarily for unemployed people but people with disabilities are also a target group. Under the scheme, full-time courses of one or two years&rsquo; duration are provided to participants to enhance their employability.</P>
        <P>The back to education initiative provides part-time further education programmes for adults to give them an opportunity to combine a return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities. People with disabilities are one of the target groups of the programme.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities may also avail of adult literacy courses provided by the VECs around the country. A grant has also been provided to the Irish Deaf Society to train tutors to give literacy tuition. A grant is awarded annually to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland as a contribution towards assessments.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities also benefit from grants under the education equality initiative. This is one of a range of initiatives which seek to address educational disadvantage by promoting equality of access and equality of treatment. This is achieved through the provision of short-term, two-year or three-year grants to organisations for specific purposes. Under the current phase of the initiative, running from 2003 to 2006, grants have been awarded to three projects catering for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>An action research pilot project was developed in a number of further education colleges in the Dublin area. This pilot project continues to be supported by two disability support officers, the National Training and Development Institute as well as flexible additional funds for transport, equipment, interpreters and so forth. The service identifies and offers supports to students and staff around the area of disability. The provision of awareness-raising sessions and participation in college open and recruitment days is also an integral element of the role of the support officer.</P>

	<P>The person concerned has exhausted his entitlement to sick pay under the terms of the departmental sick leave scheme as he has availed of over 365 days sick leave in the past four years. As I explained in my reply to Question No. 1411 of 25 January,<?oasys _jy ?>2006, the terms of the departmental sick leave scheme are of general application and they cannot be altered to suit individual circumstances. Accordingly, it is not possible to authorise additional payment under the departmental sick leave scheme in this particular case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Overgrazing has led to environmental problems, particularly loss of vegetation and soil erosion in commonages throughout the country, including the Nephin Beg range.</P>
        <P>Payments to farmers for destocking under commonage framework plans, were introduced from end of 1998 as an attempt to aid vegetation recovery in these areas. A recent monitoring survey in this area, carried out as part of an intended wider monitoring of commonages, has shown that, apart from some small areas, there has not been satisfactory recovery of the habitat vegetation.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, it is necessary to amend the requirements for this commonage by providing that it should be destocked completely for five months of the year &mdash; November-December, and mid-February to mid-May. Further monitoring will, of course, be carried out to check the rate of recovery.</P>
        <P>The above developments are also being communicated to the European Commission in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s response to the European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland on the issue of overgrazing in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg area.</P>

	<P>The Planning and Development Regulations 2005 generally exempt peat extraction below a threshold of ten hectares from the requirement for planning per<Col N="2214"/>mission. However, there are exceptions where the peat extraction would have significant effects on the environment.</P>
        <P>In these limited cases, planning permission must be applied for, accompanied by an environmental impact statement. Where the peat extraction takes place within peatland areas that have been afforded protection either as special areas of conservation or natural heritage areas, these are subject to a separate control system which is unaffected by the change to the regulations.</P>

	<P>The provision and improvement of non-national roads in County Roscommon is a matter for Roscommon County Council to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants.</P>
        <P>In August 2005, my Department sought applications from road authorities for funding under the 2006 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme. The initial selection of projects to be submitted for consideration for funding under this scheme is a matter for road authorities. Roscommon County Council submitted a number of applications but these did not include an application for funding for the Athlone to Clonown Road.</P>
        <P>On 25 January 2006, Roscommon County Council wrote to my Department seeking a special allocation of &euro;100,000 for a study on the ground conditions, methods of construction and cost of carrying out improvement works on the Athlone to Clonown Road. The council was informed that the 2006 grants were fully allocated; that there were no funds available to fund these works; but that it was open to the council to use a combination of its own resources and discretionary improvement grant allocation for this purpose. The 2006 discretionary improvement grant allocation to Roscommon County Council is &euro;1,014,000, an increase of 7% on the initial 2005 allocation. The selection of works to be funded from this allocation is entirely a matter for the council.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The council was also informed that, as an alternative, it could submit a formal application under the 2006 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme for consideration. While moneys have been fully allocated for 2006, if a suitable <Col N="2215"/>application were submitted, my Department would be prepared to consider giving approval to the council to proceed with the study on the condition that the scheme would be submitted as a priority on the council&rsquo;s 2007 EU co-financed specific improvements grant list of applications. This would allow the council to recoup approved expenditure of up to &euro;100,000 in 2007.</P>

	<P>In May 2005 I approved Kildare County Council&rsquo;s proposals to proceed with work on an advance section of the scheme at Straffan which I understand is now in progress. Kildare County Council&rsquo;s contract <Col N="2216"/>documents for the major elements of the scheme are under examination in my Department and a decision will issue shortly. Approval of the contract documents will enable the council to invite tenders for the carrying out of the works.</P>

	<P>A number of different statutory processes are involved in appointments to public bodies. In some cases statutory selection procedures must be followed or nominations must be sought from independent nominating panels before appointments are made by the Government or by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In other cases only particular public office holders may be appointed to certain boards. In a number of situations, only some appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister.</P>
        <P>In the context of the above, the names of those appointed by me to State boards since my appointment as Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government in September 2004 are set out in the following table:</P><Col N="2215"/>
