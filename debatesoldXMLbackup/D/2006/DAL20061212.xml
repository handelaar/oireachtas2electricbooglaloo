	<P>I wish to announce for the information of the D&aacute;il that on 8 December I accepted the resignation from office of Deputy S&iacute;le de Valera, Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s quality customer service charter was published in April 2004 and has been distributed to staff and customers.  The charter is displayed around the Department in a number of appropriate locations.  The charter is also available on the Department&rsquo;s website and a link is attached to all outgoing e-mails.</P>
        <P>Under the charter, the Department measures customer service performance and reports on this in its annual report.  Methods used include customer feedback, annual surveys, mystery shopping, interviews and focus groups.  The 2006 customer survey has been completed and almost 450 external customers were surveyed.  Initial analysis shows broadly favourable findings.  Overall, the results show consistently high scores in relation to the quality of our services.   There was an <Col N="626"/>increase in the awareness of the Department&rsquo;s complaints procedure and an increase in those who had noticed an improvement in the service quality.  This improvement is mainly due to a general view that the Department&rsquo;s staff were very efficient and courteous, prompt e-mail response times and the layout of the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim comhghairdeas leis an Teachta Haughey as a cheapach&aacute;n mar Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ireoidh go maith leis agus gu&iacute;m gach rath air.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tuillte aige &mdash; b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil s&eacute; thar am ach sin sc&eacute;al eile.</P>
        <P>Does the quality customer service charter of the Department of the Taoiseach include a mechanism for evaluation?  The on-line Irish Statute Book, which we have discussed before, falls short of the quality customer service charter and is not the reliable database it should be.  We previously discussed the equivalent in other jurisdictions.  Does the Taoiseach still hold the view that decentralisation will not create difficulties for customer service standards?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question refers specifically to the Department of the Taoiseach. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed it does, and so does decentralisation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to confine himself to a question relating to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will know, as does the Ceann Comhairle, that decentralisation is relevant to his Department. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This refers specifically to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is obviously relevant.  The Taoiseach must deal with all Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department is not being decentralised. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is trying to be helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As always.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want this to arise every time questions are taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure he realises the Department of the Taoiseach must interface even with his Department.  I will ask a question relating to the Department of the Taoiseach before the Ceann Comhairle asks me to sit down.  It concerns the quality customer service charter standards for doing business through Irish.  I recently spoke to a civil servant who was unable to say <Col N="627"/>who would deal with queries through Irish.  Should the Taoiseach not review that aspect of the quality customer service charter?  It is one thing to put something down on paper, but will every civil servant be able to say who will deal with queries through Irish?  It would be ideal if the person to whom I referred could do so, but the person was from England and had no Irish.     </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I dealt with the Deputy&rsquo;s first supplementary question in a recent reply.  The matter relates to the Office of the Attorney General and is not covered by my Department&rsquo;s charter.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is covered by the charter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is covered by my Department but is not by the departmental charter.  It is in the domain of the Attorney General, which also comes under my area of responsibility.  I replied on that issue in detail approximately two weeks ago and it is being addressed.  It will take us some time to resolve that issue, though hopefully not too long into the new year.  The South African company originally responsible for the matter has been contacted.  It is regretted that it happened but attempts are being made to resolve it.</P>
        <P>My Department is not being decentralised but there are no difficulties in dealing with other Departments.  We have our own procedures for dealing with our clients and that is well covered in our charter.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sargent raised on a number of occasions the issue of dealing with queries through Irish, including by e-mail.  My Department tries to deal with such queries within each section.  There is no problem with correspondence via e-mail but difficulties arise when people ring the office.  Sections in my Department have endeavoured to each have at least one person who is adequately able to write and speak in Irish.  To the best of my knowledge, some sections have a number of such people, but other sections have only one.  That is the Department&rsquo;s policy and the management team of the Department has tried to address the matter.  There can be some difficulties if the person is out from work, which can happen, but sections try to ensure adequate cover.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, quite a number of sections dealing with commemorations and other issues, such as Northern Ireland, have many dealings through Irish, but some sections do not.  It is policy that no matter how small the section &mdash; a number of my Department&rsquo;s sections are very small &mdash; it tries to ensure one person who would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Should everyone not know who the person is?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I will communicate the Deputy&rsquo;s point.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Ar an cheist ch&eacute;anna, mar gheall ar na sc&eacute;imeanna i dtaobh na dteangacha oifigi&uacute;la at&aacute; aontaithe ag an Roinn, deir s&eacute; sa chairt do chustaim&eacute;ir&iacute; go gcuirfear na sc&eacute;imeanna ar bun faoi dh&aacute;ta a n-aonta&iacute;tear leis an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta agus go gcuirfear na sc&eacute;imeanna i bhfeidhm taobh istigh den tr&eacute;imhse ama aontaithe chun na custaim&eacute;ir&iacute; a sh&aacute;samh maidir leis na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chuirtear ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  As B&eacute;arla, the customer charter of the Department of the Taoiseach states regarding the Irish language:</P>
        <P LI="1">Official languages scheme in place by date agreed with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs;</P>
        <P LI="1">Scheme implemented within agreed framework;</P>
        <P LI="1">Customer satisfaction levels with services provided through Irish.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Taoiseach gave some indication of how the different parts are working, but will he report on progress in respect of the delivery of the full scheme, part of which is to have someone on standby at all times?  Will this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy&rsquo;s question relate to the Department of the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to that Department&rsquo;s customer service charter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in reply to Deputy Sargent, a number of sections in my Department have quite a number of dealings through Irish, but other sections do not.  Sections with ongoing dealings through the Irish language have a number of people who can deal with telephone calls or callers to the Department.  The Department does not receive many visitors due to the nature of its work, but it receives correspondence, e-mails and telephone calls.</P>
        <P>Some of the smaller sections dealing with other issues may not have many people, but the policy is to try to ensure at least one person with ability in Irish per section.  Some sections are quite small and may not always have such a person, but larger sections have a number of people who can deal with matters through Irish on a daily basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to alter the functions of the communications unit in my Department.  The unit will continue to work during the period following the dissolution of the 29th D&aacute;il as it did following the dissolution of the 28th D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The unit operates on an apolitical basis and only deals with the Government Press Office and the press offices of the various Departments.  It has no contact with Government backbenchers or other Deputies.  The staff of the unit are subject to the usual conventions that apply to civil servants in respect of political impartiality at all times.  I am satisfied they will continue to observe these conventions in the performance of their work.</P>
        <P>The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments.  It furnishes news updates and transcripts that ensure Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments.  In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.</P>
        <P>The communications unit works an 18 hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts.  The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments.  The work of the unit means Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensures they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I like the hypothesis that the communications unit is apolitical.  I appreciate the staff are doing the job they are being asked to do so to that extent they are not driven by the same political motivations as a Deputy or party worker but the work carried out by the unit, however, is ostensibly for the Government and, therefore, supports Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrat policy positions.  Does the communications unit deal with either party&rsquo;s headquarters in the course of the Government work the Taoiseach <Col N="630"/>outlined?  Is it not reasonable, given the apolitical nature of the unit, that it would deal with all national public representatives in terms of feedback from the communications it monitors?</P>
        <P>I am interested in finding out the definition of apolitical.  Is it the same as the way non-electoral activity happens before the three week run-up to the election and has nothing to do with it?  It is difficult to gauge where apolitical ends and political starts.  Does the Taoiseach agree there is a political dimension to this work and, therefore, all parties should benefit from it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The unit has no dealings with the headquarters of any political party as that would be totally inappropriate.  For that matter, it has no dealings with Ministers and Ministers of State, it deals with the press offices of Departments.  Its work during election periods is to send information to a Department and it is likely the Minister and Minister of State will be there.  Other than that I would not change any of its functions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Taoiseach mean to say the communications unit has no contact with Ministers?  I understand it does and I understand why it does.</P>
        <P>The question is what happens in the course of a general election.  Officeholders already enjoy a significant advantage by definition.  During the course of an election campaign, although Deputies are no longer Members of this House, Ministers continue in their positions with access that is unavailable to those on this side of the House.  Is the communications unit not supporting the infrastructure of ministerial involvement which, by definition, in an election campaign is politically partisan?</P>
        <P>The question arises of that work being declared to the Commission on Standards in Public Office as a relevant payment.  The unit costs around &euro;350,000 per annum and whatever about the political impartiality of the good civil servants working in it, and I do not question that, the work in the context of an election in supporting and briefing Ministers is very political indeed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The communications unit takes the daily news from the national broadcasting agencies and presents it to the Departments; Ministers and Ministers of State would then receive that.  Individual Ministers look for reports from the unit through their own staff but it has no political purpose.  It is not engaged in political activity on any given day.  The unit provides information to a huge range of senior departmental officials.  No political gain or benefit accrues to a politician from this unit either inside or outside an election period.  Individual press offices in the political system gather their own information and notes, but the information gathered by this unit either inside or outside an election period is not of a political nature.  There tends to be less <Col N="631"/>activity in a Department during an election period and, therefore, the unit would be less busy because Departments may not seek as much information when the House is in recess.  The unit&rsquo;s work at any time is not of a political nature and it is used only by Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The question arises, if no benefit is conferred on Ministers, what is the point of the exercise in the first place.  The information being conveyed and the fact of the communication is to brief and support Ministers and make them aware of what is being said, including by the Opposition, and so no.  That benefit is not available to Deputies Sargent and Kenny, to me or any other Opposition Member.  Has the Taoiseach sought a view from the commission, for example, on whether these transactions have no political content, particularly during a general election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not done that.  If I wanted to find out what anybody said on a political issue, I would ask my press office to check that rather than examining the nuanced report on the first 15 items of a news bulletin.  That is not a great political issue and it would probably be quicker to listen to the news headlines.  The unit does not provide any political benefit whatsoever, particularly during an election.  It performs a useful function in providing the news reports to the entire Civil Service system and to Ministers and Ministers of State.  When Departments seek information on what was said during programmes and transcripts of programmes, they contact the unit, which produces them, and that is of benefit because if Departments were to do this, they would use an external agency.  The unit provides a useful service without any political connotation.  Its work is produced by civil servants and I assure the Deputy they do not provide blow by blow insights into the political nature of issues.  If I was trying to get a feel for what Deputies Rabbitte, Kenny or Sargent were saying about me, I would not check with the Civil Service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, might want to know what I was saying about him before he writes about it in his Sunday newspaper column.</P>

	<P>Who writes the column for him?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If the unit has no political connection, can we take it that it will close during the forthcoming general election campaign?  What value does the Taoiseach see in having such a unit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have other things on his mind.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="632"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the unit&rsquo;s staff call the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Sean Power, during the campaign to inform him they are talking about him in Wexford and he needs to issue a press release about that?  Will the unit be closed during the general election?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has always made the point that the unit saves Departments approximately &euro;200,000 annually, yet its projected cost for 2006 is &euro;352,626.  The Taoiseach is spending &euro;350,000 to save &euro;200,000.  There are many examples showing financial management to be a weakness in some Departments, so how does he justify this, if it is merely a floating information service?  Will the communications unit be closed during the forthcoming election so people can see there is no political element to it?  Cost is another issue with savings of &euro;200,000 contrasting with costs of &euro;350,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Civil Service is not closing down during the election and the communications unit is part of the Civil Service structure.  Before the communications unit, a range of news agencies made a small killing from Departments by collecting information from media sources and selling it on.  It was a good service but it is now done by a unit within the Civil Service.  The information provided by news programmes is made available throughout the Civil Service and it is good that the various information units within the Civil Service know what is being said and done.  Deputies are welcome to go and have a look at the communications unit.  I do not think they will find it of huge political benefit, but it provides a good service to Departments and agencies, though one would not use it as one&rsquo;s press office.</P>

	<P>I did not expect to hear about travel arrangements.  Regarding the cost of political advisers, does the Taoiseach feel he is getting value for money?  Should the type of adviser and the advice sought and given be examined?  We have raised this issue previously, especially in regard to the responsibilities of Ministers of State, and Sustainable Energy Ireland raised related matters today.  Regarding global heating, or climate change &mdash; there are many different terms now for the phenomenon &mdash; does the Government have an equivalent to the British Government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Sir David King?  If so, will the Government act on the advice it will probably receive, given that we have re-coupled CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions with growing energy use and expect transport related energy to increase by over 8% every year for the foreseeable future?  Is the Taoiseach receiving advice on climate change and is this advice coming from advisers or elsewhere?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A science group gives Departments and agencies advice in that field.  We regularly ask members of agencies to present a briefing to Cabinet committees and meetings.  This is a day-to-day feature of Cabinet committees in particular.  The science group addresses senior staff in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regularly.</P>

	<P>I asked if there was an equivalent to the British Government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Sir David King, in the Irish context, and did not receive an answer.  The Taoiseach said a group gives advice, but on the issue of carbon credit who advised that &euro;270 million be given away to pay a fine?</P>

	<P>I am trying to find out if an adviser exists.  Apparently one does not, but a group fills this role.  Will there be an adviser at that level?  The Taoiseach will remember we had problems previously with a science adviser who did not have the proper qualifications.</P>

	<P>Yes, but not every Department comes under these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question of whether we have advisers similar to those referred to in No. 10 or No. 11, where there are contract advisers for practically every area, we do not operate such a system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about one person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They have one person for everything, irrespective of the issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A science adviser works in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and we are working with that individual.  A small group, the science committee, holds meetings which we attend to discuss issues including environmental issues.  However, its members do not work in my Department but come from relevant Departments or, in many cases, relevant agencies.  The Deputy is correct with regard to what happens in No. 10 but it would cost us a fortune to duplicate that in a country of 4.3 million people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was whether the Taoiseach listens to advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I always listen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste have a programme manager and is that manager located in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, as was the practice under the previous T&aacute;naiste?  Has the Taoiseach&rsquo;s former press officer been replaced or, if not, is it intended to replace him?  I am aware he is trying to do for the HSE the job he did so well for the Taoiseach.  </P>
        <P>With regard to the most recent indication by the Taoiseach that 13 staff are employed in his private office and eight in his constituency office, are those figures still correct and, if so, are they not somewhat extravagant?  My colleague, Deputy Costello, has one parliamentary assistant, <Col N="635"/>whereas the Taoiseach has an entire infrastructure.</P>

With regard to Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question, 12 staff, as well as one usher, are employed in my private office; and nine staff, four clerical officers and five others, are employed in my constituency office.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>Staff in my private office comprise one private secretary at assistant principal grade, one assistant principal, two assistant private secretaries at higher executive officer grade, one personal assistant, one staff officer, one executive officer, five clerical officers and one usher.  The total cost, estimated to November 2006, of salaries including allowances and overtime for my private office is &euro;675,217, while expenses total &euro;2,508.</P>
        <P>Staff in my constituency office comprise two personal assistants, one personal secretary, one executive officer, one staff officer and four clerical officers.

        <P>Staff of the office of the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip comprise one private secretary at higher executive officer grade, one executive officer, two staff officers, one staff officer, one clerical officer, one personal assistant and one personal secretary.  The total cost, estimated to November 2006, of salaries including allowances and overtime for the staff of the office of the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip is &euro;389,430, while expenses total &euro;7,312.</P>
        <P>Staff of the office of the Minister of State for European Affairs, excluding Department of Foreign Affairs Staff, comprise one private secretary at higher executive officer grade and one clerical officer.

</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I will repeat my question.  While I accept the Taoiseach has a huge constituency workload, is it not the case that he has an extravagant array of staff to back him up?  Such a facility is not afforded to the rest of us in any fashion.  I note the Taoiseach said he has cut back on his level of staffing.  The Taoiseach referred to the appointment of a personal tipstaff.  Was that always there?  Is that a new appointment?  What exactly is the responsibility of that appointment?  Is the Taoiseach saying there is now one person less in his private office than there was when this question was last answered, about a year ago?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are all civil servants.  Many of the people in the private office and the constituency office are civil servants who are always seeking promotions to other areas.  There is always a movement of people.  I do not think there is any great change.  The individual in question is a former member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think the person held their <Col N="637"/>entitlements from here.  The person in question brings delegations and deputations from the gates of Government Buildings through the House, back and forward, on a daily basis.  I think the person just happens to be somebody who was seconded from here.  There was somebody else doing it, but it was not a member of the staff here.  In the advisory staff, there is one less, or maybe even two less, over the last few years.  Dr. Martin Mansergh became a Senator and there was also a change in the numbers.  Most of the constituency staff are juniors.  Most of them are from the former typist grades, the clerical officer grade and the staff officer grade.  There are two personal assistants.  I think all of the others, bar one, are civil servants.</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is one of the lucky Deputies who have constituency offices in respect of which they do not have to pay rent.  Would the Taoiseach like to comment on the level of fairness in that regard?  I refer to the fact that Deputies like him, who have property, are able to base their constituency offices in their own properties, whereas Deputies who have no property have to pay the commercial rate to rent such offices.  Both categories of Deputy are treated the same by the Oireachtas, essentially.  Is there not a need to look at that from the point of view of fairness?  Although the Taoiseach is benefiting from this arrangement, I am sure he empathises with those of us who do not have the fortune to have mighty trusts providing us with offices free of charge.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask a question that relates to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own office.  Will the Taoiseach tell the people in his office that it is not appropriate to send electoral material in Oireachtas envelopes with Christmas cards?  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s Christmas cards include a request for people to help him with his canvassing or with anything else he needs to get re-elected.  Has the Taoiseach given an instruction to his officials in that regard?  While my colleague, Patricia McKenna, welcomed the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Christmas greetings, it came as a bit of a shock to her to be asked to help with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s canvassing.  I thought it was quite audacious of the Taoiseach to make such a request.  Will the Taoiseach advise his officials in that regard?  None of us, least of all the Taoiseach, wants to get into trouble for flouting electoral regulations.</P>

	<P>That party is fairly active on the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that Deputy Sargent has raised it, I think it is peculiar that even if one does not pay rent, one gets a form every year saying that one received the benefit of rent that one never paid.  It is extraordinary.  It is misleading because when people see it, they think one paid rent because one notionally declared it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not cost anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly, and then one sees a declaration that the value of it is &euro;30,000 when there is no cost.  It is totally confusing but those are the rules and I comply with them.</P>
        <P>With regard to using Oireachtas envelopes, which I did, it is totally within my entitlement &mdash; I have had a chance to check this &mdash; to distribute what is not an electoral leaflet.  I was shocked that Patricia McKenna was upset about this because only three days earlier she came to me to ask me to help her with the school her children attend.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Budget 2007 introduced last week provides the necessary financial underpinning in my Department&rsquo;s capital envelope to <Col N="639"/>deliver on its ambitious affordable homes target set out in Towards 2016.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Specifically, the Government has acted to address issues of housing affordability.  A range of targeted schemes to assist first-time buyers has been put in place directed specifically at those who cannot meet their own housing needs.  These include the shared ownership scheme, the 1999 affordable housing scheme, affordable housing through Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 and the affordable housing initiative under Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>In addition, we have established the affordable homes partnership to co-ordinate and accelerate the delivery of affordable housing in and around the capital.  Since its establishment last year, the partnership has made progress in a number of areas.  These include land exchanges, a &ldquo;call for lands&rdquo; initiative designed to bring forward additional land for affordable housing and the development of common approaches to the implementation of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
        <P>The momentum of delivery under the various schemes is growing, particularly under Part V, and it is estimated that some 3,000 homes will be delivered from all the schemes this year.  On the basis of the momentum now achieved, we have an ambitious target for the period 2007 to 2009 with some 17,000 homes in total to be delivered under the various affordable schemes.  This is a substantial commitment to meeting the needs of first-time buyers seeking affordable housing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that he has performed poorly in the supply of affordable housing, particularly under Part V?  In view of the fact that approximately 90,000 houses will be built this year, the Minister of State should have told me that 18,000 affordable housing units will be coming on stream rather than the paltry 3,000 &mdash; welcome as they are &mdash; he has made available.  Will he agree it is time for him, as Minister, to shake up the local authorities that are not delivering the affordable housing they ought to be delivering?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion that our performance in this respect is poor.  The Deputy will note from the data available that the number of units has increased year by year.  I explained the position about the Part 5 provision several times.  It is a great idea and in time it will be a marvellous deliverer of social and affordable housing but, as we all know, it will take time for it to click in.  It does not apply to planning permissions which existed prior to the introduction of the legislation.  This year the figures are up on those of previous years.  From now on we can expect a better dividend from the Part 5 provision.  It will be proven in time to have been <Col N="640"/>an innovative idea.  The Deputy&rsquo;s party fought it tooth and nail at the time but I firmly believe in it.  In time it will produce the goods in terms of social and affordable housing.</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is not fighting tooth and nail for the people of Dublin or for the young people in his constituency.  They have been forced to leave the city and must commute to Dublin from outlying counties.  They have long commutes resulting in work days of up to 12 to 14 hours.  This is the position because the Minister of State is not fighting their corner and ensuring that land is released.  He is not ensuring that local authorities do their job.  </P>
        <P>It appears that the kernel of the issue is that a significant number of developers are sitting on land rather than developing it.  Will the Minister of State  introduce a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; provision in legislation to insist that where that is happening such land will be released and that affordable housing will be built on it?  If he does not do that and continues on the path he is following, he will make it impossible for young people to buy their own home, to purchase an affordable house, particularly in his constituency and elsewhere in the city of Dublin.</P>
        <P>This is the first generation of Dublin people who cannot afford to live beside their parents or grandparents and who must spend practically day and night commuting to and from work.  In doing that they rarely see their own families.  The Government has abjectly failed them.  It has failed to provide the affordable housing that is badly needed.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s performance today in saying that 3,000 units will be delivered this year is unacceptable.</P>

The percentage of people in the <Col N="641"/>25 to 34 year age bracket, which is the key household formation age group, has increased by<?oasys _jy ?>18%, which is a huge increase.  The people in that age bracket are working and contributing to the economy.  Such an increase in the number in that age bracket has caused a huge demand for housing, be it private or other forms of housing.  Dublin city is nearly totally built up.  There is not much opportunity to provide further housing in the city other than increasing housing density.  People are moving out further.  Finglas County Council is the local authority area in which there has been the greatest level of development &mdash; a similar pattern applies to South Dublin County Council &mdash; and it has responded most to the challenge presented.  Some people have moved to live in Drogheda, which is only up the road.  Once one is at the airport it takes only ten minutes to reach Drogheda.</P>

	<P>The assessment of housing need undertaken by local authorities in March 1996 <Col N="642"/>indicated that a total of 27,427 households were in need of housing while the corresponding figure for March 2005 was 43,684 households.  The March 2005 figure was a decrease of almost 10% on the corresponding figure of 48,413 households in March 2002.  The decrease in the numbers on the waiting lists has resulted from the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s investment in the provision of social and affordable housing.</P>
        <P>Of the 33,321 new houses completed in 1996, 3,593 were social housing units, which represented over 10% of total output.  In 2005, 80,957 new houses were completed, of which 5,559 units were social units, representing almost 7% of total output.  The number of completed social housing units at the end of September this year was 3,340.  It is expected that the total social housing output for this year, including acquisitions, will be in the region of 6,800.  Overall, it is estimated that the needs of over 14,000 households will be addressed through social and affordable housing measures this year compared with 8,600 in 2000, six years ago.</P>
        <P>Additional resources will be provided next year to address social and affordable housing need.  A record provision of &euro;1.5 billion is being made available, which is a 9% increase in Exchequer housing programmes over this year&rsquo;s levels and double the provision of six years ago.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, notwithstanding the fact that he managed to describe a 16,000 increase in social housing numbers between 1996 and 2005 as a decrease.  Did he see &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; last night?  It showed the scandalous way in which home buyers in this country are being ripped off by estate agents and mortgage brokers, because of the failure of the Government to regulate these bodies.  What action will he take to regulate estate agents and other professionals in the housing market?  What action will he take to end the scandal of unfinished housing estates?

	<P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has proposed that managing agents answer to the regulator dealing with estate agents.

I am also surprised the extensive media monitoring units, available to the Government at the expense of the taxpayer, did not do the job for him so he could address the issue today.  Instead, he has kicked to touch and stated it is the responsibility of other Departments.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposed a Bill over five years ago to regulate the housing market, which was shot down by the Government.  We have brought a number of private members&rsquo; proposals before the House which dealt with taking charge of unfinished housing estates and the regulation of housing management companies and management charges, all of which were shot down by a Government that promised to do something in the future.  After ten years in office, is it acceptable that the Government allows the scandalous rip-off that we saw demonstrated on television last night?  Young people trying to buy a home of their own are being ripped off by unscrupulous chancers who have licence to do as they like from a Government which seems more interested in keeping some people&rsquo;s pockets full than protecting the consumer interests of home buyers.</P>

If one were trying to make an accurate comparison between the numbers in social housing ten years ago and today, one would need to allow for the acquisitions.  However, we could not give that figure because of the way the Deputy asked his question.  Local authorities acquire houses through new buildings and second-hand purchases.  We also need to look at the number in receipt of rent allowance.</P>

        <Quest> the results of meetings he has had recently with British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Mr. Alistair Darling on the issue of Sellafield; if and when there are other meetings planned during the coming year; his plans to reiterate to the British Government the adverse environmental and health consequences that have arisen for Ireland in the past; the way he will reflect the unacceptable nature of Sellafield&rsquo;s existence to the British Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[42631/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Question No. 65 of 8 November 2006, I advised that my meeting with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Mr. Alistair Darling MP, is due to take place on 9 January 2007.  This follows my earlier meeting with Mr. Darling&rsquo;s predecessor, Mr. Alan Johnson MP, as well as contacts with my UK counterpart Mr. David Milliband MP, and with the chairman and chief executive of the British Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.  I met earlier this year with European justice Commissioner Frattini, energy Commissioner Piebalgs and environment Commissioner Dimas to discuss Irish concerns on Sellafield in the context of the EU jurisdiction for nuclear safety.   </P>
        <P>Adverse environmental consequences have arisen for Ireland as a result of nuclear policy decisions and actions adopted by the UK.  Our concerns about Sellafield have been consistently articulated to the UK Administration at Prime Minister, ministerial and official level and I intend to reiterate strongly these concerns to the UK Secretary of State next month.  Ongoing contact through correspondence and meetings at ministerial, official and expert level is maintained with the UK authorities regarding a range of issues on the Sellafield plant.  These contacts are <Col N="645"/>productive and reflect an increasing recognition by the British Government of the serious concerns held by the Irish Government about Sellafield.  This increasing recognition stems from the fact that this Government has consistently impressed upon the UK &mdash; through international legal actions and so on &mdash; that Ireland has a substantive interest in the nuclear issues under deliberation in the United Kingdom.  However, there remains a significant difference in views between this Government and the British Government about the nuclear energy issue in general and more particularly on the continued operation of the Sellafield nuclear plant.</P>
        <P>Government policy continues to reflect the firm position that the existence of Sellafield is an unacceptable threat to Ireland and that it should be closed in a safe and orderly manner.  The Government will also continue to use every legal, political and diplomatic avenue open to it to secure the closure and safe decommissioning of the plant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will he agree that the British are now getting ahead of him again, substantially, as regards Sellafield and its reprocessing operations?  Does he accept that the proposed new chain of nuclear power plants planned for across England, in particular, will feed Sellafield with waste for reprocessing for at least another generation?  Is he aware that people wishing to object to those nuclear power plants cannot do so directly?  They have to go through an advocate appointed by the British Government, who will not be permitted to engage, even to the point of giving information to the clients he or she represents, or share any information with the objectors.  Will the Minister object to that whole new chain of power plants, because they will feed into and sustain Sellafield for some considerable time to come? </P>
        <P>If the Minister so objects, will he accept an advocate acting on his behalf and through him, the Irish people?  In the event, will he accept that level of restriction from the British Government?  Given the week that is in it, that looks more like a salute to Pinochet than any type of democracy I could consider.  I look forward to a brief supplementary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view that the planning process about to be embarked upon in the United Kingdom is less than satisfactory.  It is certainly less open, transparent and democratically acceptable than the Irish system.  I have made clear, particularly in my meeting with Mr. Alan Johnson, Secretary of State for Education and Skills and the predecessors of Mr. David <Col N="646"/>Miliband, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, that we do not agree with the build-up policy with which the British Government seems intent on pressing ahead.  We have made it very clear that there is widespread opposition, not just in the Government parties, but across the entire democratic spectrum in Ireland.  We have made it very clear that there are great concerns here. </P>
        <P>We have also made clear to them that we have the right to do so, and, to be fair, they have accepted we have a view that must be factored in.  The general issue encompasses the fact that we will continue to build as many alliances as we can on this, and not just across the Irish Sea.  There are also concerns among other governments within the European Union.  There is an increasing dawning of reality in Europe that the nuclear initiative, whatever else it is, is not the answer to global warming or the energy crisis.  It is simply putting off the crisis and imposing on future generations the cost of dealing with energy issues today.  The Deputy may feel assured that at each and every opportunity we will pursue the matter, and I am sure we shall have his support in so doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister appreciate the level of destruction that is occurring on the eastern seaboard, particularly in my constituency in particular, as a consequence of the whole Sellafield plant and the emissions coming from it?  Does he appreciate the urgency of the issue because people are dying in great numbers right across that area and a serious investigation is required to get to the bottom of this? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very sympathetic to the views expressed by the Deputy.  These are views I have long shared.  As a long-term reality we should all unite to make it abundantly clear to politicians of whatever persuasion in the UK that we do not believe this is acceptable, and neither is it a good solution for them. </P>

        <Quest> if he is satisfied that the level of local government funding is adequate to meet the increased responsibilities of local authorities, the increase in population as shown in Census 2006 and the increase in the level of housing due to the huge increase in construction activity in recent years; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[42879/06] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This question from Deputy McCormack touches on both capital and current expenditure so I shall deal with both.  The Exchequer capital provision for mainstream capital programmes funded through my Department and administered by local authorities will amount <Col N="647"/>to &euro;1,976 million in 2007 representing a year on year increase of 7%. There will be some upward adjustment, when I mention non-national roads.  When account is taken of the capital provisions for national roads, funded through the NRA, the Exchequer capital funding to local authorities in 2007 rises to &euro;3,451 million, an increase of 8% over 2006.  That is significant on the capital side.  </P>
        <P>Funding for 2007 to local authorities, through general purpose grants from the local government fund, will continue the strong trend of increasing central Government support for the local government sector.  Yesterday I announced the allocation of almost &euro;958 million to local authorities for 2007, increasing the level of general purpose grants by 8% over the final allocation for 2006.  The 2007 allocations figure represents an increase 2.8 times the initial allocation provided in 1997.  The allocation includes an additional &euro;10 million to certain local authorities for additional operational costs associated with new water services infrastructure, which will be distributed shortly.  Deputy McCormack will be aware that some local authorities are finding it difficult to make the transition from the full capitalisation of current costs and I will provide relief for them in that regard.</P>
        <P>In total, the increase in funding is five times greater than the level of inflation, which was about 35%, between 1997 and the end of this year.  This funding will assist local authorities in framing realistic and reasonable budgets in the statutory time period available to them to complete their budgetary process.  Further allocations will be made to local authorities in January for non-national roads and local improvement schemes.  These allocations will also show an increase on the allocation of &euro;558 million provided for 2006.</P>
        <P>The Government has provided unprecedented increases in funding to local authorities since 1997.  I am satisfied that with our commitment to local government and increased income generated from the greatly strengthened commercial base supported by the Government&rsquo;s successful economic policies, local authorities are in a very good position to respond to the public&rsquo;s need for quality services.  In allocating funding for 2007, I have taken into account the cost to each authority of providing its services, and factors including population increases and the income from local sources.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>Local authorities have also benefited from substantial income from development levies, currently bringing in over &euro;500 million per annum, as well as buoyancy in their rates&rsquo; base in line with general business growth in the economy brought about by sound national economic policies.  The adoption of a budget is one of the most <Col N="648"/>important reserved functions conferred on local authorities as it underpins their financial business for the following year.  While I have no direct function in budgetary decision making at local level, I have urged local authorities to continue to exercise appropriate restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates and charges.  This is important to the long-term viability and competitiveness of commercial operations and to the overall competitiveness of the economy.  Local authorities responded positively this year to my request in this regard and increases in rates and charges for 2006 were generally of a lower order than in previous years.</P>
        <P>Current expenditure in the local government sector in 2007 is likely to be some &euro;4.5 billion.  Within this quantum of expenditure there is scope for efficiencies, innovation and further steps to ensure greater value for money.  Elected members should examine their draft budget closely to ensure that every effort is made to get the maximum value for the expenditure proposed.</P>
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister is saying to the effect that funds to local government have increased.  He quoted almost a 7% increase in funds this year, but the cost to local authorities of fulfilling their duties has greatly increased also.  They are now responsible for many more services than previously.  The Minister mentioned funds for national primary and national secondary roads.  I assume he realises that in the eastern and southern regions, as regards Cohesion and Structural Funds, six times more is spent than in the BMW region.  There is clear discrimination against the BMW region as regards the amount of funds being spent on infrastructural projects.  Recent figures showed that about six times more was being spent, despite the fact that it was the BMW region that helped Ireland qualify for the higher level of grants the last time, because the GNP was less than 90% of the European average.  </P>
        <P>Will the Minister explain, despite what he says about the 7% increase, why local authorities are still charging development fees and setting up management companies?  The householder is paying for this all the time.   Despite the fact that the Minister gave me genuine assurances in the House more than six months ago that he would instruct local authorities to discontinue placing conditions in planning permissions for management fees, they are still doing this.  I should like him to look into that again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Deputy for that.  If he wants to let me have particular details of any local authority which is operating in the manner he has outlined, I shall have the matter investigated.  I am sure the Deputy is sincere in his assertion. </P><Col N="649"/>
        <P>The increased funding for local authorities is five times higher than the rate of inflation over the past ten years, and that is a very significant increase.   A question has been tabled for later on development charges in general, but there are absolutely phenomenal amounts of money flowing into the coffers of local authorities.  The Deputy touched on the issue of the spend on non-national roads.  The national road spend comes under the auspices of the NRA.  He has a point in that regard.  It is disappointing that as the Exchequer, under a number of different Administrations over the past decade, increased the resources it made available to local authorities for non-national roads, councils have cut the proportion of local funds they are putting into non-national roads.  I have published some details on the website because it is important public representatives know the facts in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is simply not acceptable that as central Exchequer funding for non-national roads rises, the proportion of funding from some local authorities falls.  Ultimately however, this is within the control of local councils.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a supplementary question.  If the Minister is giving this money to local authorities, why are there higher charges for water rates and development fees?  Why are local authorities&rsquo; commercial rates rising every year?  Why are local authorities unable to balance their budgets, even with the 7% increase approved by the Minister, and still must impose such additional costs on the householders and business communities within their localities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that last year saw relatively moderate rate increases nationwide and one local authority &mdash; Limerick City Council if I recall correctly &mdash; cut its rates for the first time for a long period.  The circular letter I will issue this week to local authorities will ask them to exercise caution regarding rate increases.  However, the gross rates figures achieved by local authorities reflect a considerable buoyancy in the commercial sector.  The Deputy should note there are approximately 250,000 more small and medium sized companies than was the case and consequently, the rates yield is significant.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct as this illustrates that tighter control within local authorities will certainly squeeze out more value for money.  I made an announcement yesterday to the effect that I would make significant changes regarding audit committees within local authorities, to allow them to bring in expertise.  A point made by councillors from across the political spectrum is that they find it increasingly difficult to come to grips with the estimates as presented.  The latter are frequently described as being impenetrable and frequently are so.  I want this to change because, like the Deputy, I want value for money in local government.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue touches on the point raised by Deputy McCormack&rsquo;s supplementary question.  Prior to the enactment of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities could require payment of a development contribution as a condition of a planning permission on a discretionary basis.  From 2004, in order to introduce transparency and openness to the system, each local authority was required to adopt a development contribution scheme stating the basis for determining the contributions to be paid in respect of public infrastructure and facilities in its area and indicating the contribution to be paid for different types of infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Development contribution schemes are adopted by the democratically elected members of the individual planning authorities.  They are reserved functions and it is a matter for councillors in each locality to decide democratically what the scale will be.</P>
        <P>I consider the new system that was endorsed by the Oireachtas and which helps to ensure contributions are levied appropriately across all sectors of development to be fair and transparent.  The question is asked as to why there are significant differences between localities.  As development contributions constitute one of the fundamental sources of financing for infrastructure and underpin the facilities required in particular areas, it is inevitable there will be variation in development contribution rates.</P>
        <P>However, in circular letter PD 4/2003 my Department advised planning authorities that they should be mindful of the policies adopted by other authorities in their immediate area in respect of setting the level of development charges.  Planning authorities were also advised in the aforementioned circular that while it is expected that developers should make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure, care should be taken to avoid development contributions that are excessively high.  Deputy McCormack&rsquo;s supplementary question touched on this point.  My Department also has the opportunity to comment on draft schemes before they are adopted and has so done.</P>
        <P>Circular letter PD 4/2003 also stated it would be advisable to review the scheme at two to three year intervals, where the scheme is adopted for a longer period.  The Department has established an interdepartmental committee to consider <Col N="651"/>issues raised by different interests regarding development contributions schemes.  There have been some complaints in this regard.</P>
        <P>As previously noted, since the introduction of the planning code paying a development contribution has been a basic cost for developers, which is payable in advance of the start of construction.  There is no evidence that development contributions have had the effect of increasing the final price charged by developers, as is sometimes suggested.  While the tabular statement is too lengthy to be read in the House, the Deputy will find the figures staggering.  Last year, the amount collected by planning authorities in development contributions came to &euro;519.4 million.</P>
        <P>I will be interested in the months ahead to ascertain how these funds will be spent.   The circular letter issued to local authorities has asked them to ensure the local councillors, as they enter the estimates process, are aware of the amount of money being collected.  Based on returns made for the annual planning statistics, in 2004 the figure in development levies came to &euro;337 million, which rose to &euro;519.4 million last year.  Consequently, any suggestion that local authorities are short of funding for the types of services all members wish to see them provide deserves close scrutiny.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I voted for the scheme in Kildare and sought some ring-fencing in order that councillors would have some control over it.  It is obvious that in seeking local contributions from any capital schemes, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is one of the drivers of the final extent of the levies.  There is no shortage of projects on which money should be spent.  Indeed, a considerable amount was excluded from the Kildare scheme because it would not have been sustainable.</P>
        <P>However, the burden has been shifted from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to local authorities.  Although much money is being collected, some local authorities are in significant debt.  I received a parliamentary reply from the Minister regarding capital and current debts as of last year and the amount came to &euro;3.5 billion.  Apart from a major capital debt, Kildare County Council has an additional overdraft of &euro;25 million.</P>
        <P>The jury is out as to whether levies have an impact on the price of houses.  I will provide one example with which I believe the Minister will agree.  In a development which was carried out in two phases, the price of a first phase apartment was &euro;350,000.  However, by the time the second phase was being sold, the price of an identical apartment with the same development levies and planning permission had risen to &euro;500,000.</P>
        <P>Last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme demonstrated that unscrupulous auctioneers, valuers and estate agents have as much of a role in driving up prices as do development contributions.  While I am unsure whether this is a cause for concern for the Minister, there can be variations in house type, as opposed to the amount of contributions paid.  In the case of County Kildare, a large number of apartments are being constructed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="653"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for which there is a lower level of contribution.  Such issues must be considered because apartments rather than houses are being built under the Part V provisions.  Frequently, they are not the best solution in family situations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, the Deputy noted she had voted for development contributions in County Kildare.  She was correct in so doing because development contributions are meant to deliver value on the ground.  She also mentioned the idea they should be ring-fenced, which is also appropriate.  I have no issues in this regard.  However, I wish to see greater transparency in order that councillors who enter the estimates process know exactly what money is on hand.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also referred to an issue that is outside the scope of this question, namely to the treasury management or fund management capacity of individual local authorities.  I find it difficult to understand the reason some local authorities run substantial overdrafts on schemes when, on investigation of the issue, one discovers the existence of draw-downs and a range of other issues.  Perhaps the audit committees to which I have referred will be able to deal with this matter.</P>
        <P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s other point that undoubtedly, there is unscrupulous profit taking.  I know of a case in my constituency in which two housing estates were for sale.  When the first estate sold out, the houses in the other estate immediately rose in price by &euro;50,000.  As for the issue regarding public funds and the control of development levies, the latter are now well in excess of &euro;500 million and are heading for &euro;600 million this year.  This provides a significant fillip to local authorities and is one reason I become extremely impatient when local authorities state they lack money to install a footpath as they have imposed levies to do precisely that.  This issue must be driven at both local and national levels and I am highly conscious of the value for money points raised by the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Minister&rsquo;s point about the funds available to local authorities, he spoke of the development levies being part of the budget process.  The budget process relates to the revenue account rather than the capital account.  In his circular letter of 2004, the Minister specifically excluded the use of development levies.  Where is the relevance there?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The relevance is that many of the activities for which local authorities now return the excuse to Deputy Murphy, me and every other public representative that they do not have funds are by their nature capital activities.  Deputy Murphy correctly stated that local authorities cannot use the development levies.  She <Col N="654"/>mentioned that they are ring-fenced in Kildare, and properly so.  They cannot use for current purposes developmental levies which were incurred for capital purposes because that would be simply unacceptable, but they can use them for all sorts of activities, for example, new roads, car parking, specific public traffic infrastructure in their own areas and specific land acquisition.  They have used them, for example, to create certain facilities in individual areas.</P>
        <P>I need and am looking for far more transparency for the people.  The councillors have had to make the brave decision to introduce a levy scheme.  They should have a clear account of where the levy scheme money is going and all too frequently that has not been the case.  Councillors of all parties and none, from many different councils, have told me that they want to see the system more transparent.  That is why I am introducing additional audit committees and will provide additional resources and supports for that by way of regulation in the new year.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> the reason he has closed off the opportunity to appeal special area of conservation designations already notified to the European Commission without allowing a period for landowners to submit appeals; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[42247/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no amendment of the provisions relating to special areas of conservation, SACs, appeals as set out in the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997.  These provisions allow persons with a legal interest in designated areas to object to such designations, on scientific grounds, within a three-month period from the time of designation.  Moreover, in circumstances where a candidate site has already been notified to the European Commission for acceptance as an SAC, the habitats directive and the regulations provide that no alteration of site boundaries shall be made without the consent of the Commission.  The three months allowed for appeals in respect of SAC designations compares favourably with the 28 day appeals period available for objections under planning and environmental law generally.</P>
        <P>Ireland is required by a decision of the European Court of Justice to finalise and transmit to the European Commission the boundaries of our SACs.  In these circumstances, it is necessary to adhere to the formal provisions of the 1997 regulations regarding appeals and not to permit <Col N="655"/>administrative derogations from these, as had been practised in some cases in the past.  This approach is also justified given the improved notification procedures to land holders which are now being operated by my Department.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that it is not only legally necessary but also fair and reasonable to apply the statutory three-month period provided for SAC appeals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  Is it not the case that until last month the three-month period for appeal was not enforced by the Department and farmers continued to have the opportunity to make appeals to the Department, and that such facility has been withdrawn as and from a decision by the Minister of State last month?  Is it not the case that the Minister of State has introduced new notification procedures because the previous notification procedures were wholly inadequate?  For example, I received a telephone call last week from a farmer who applied for planning permission on his land but was refused because his lands were designated as an SAC.  He was not aware that was the case, even though the SACs were designated three years ago, until he received the refusal from the local authority.  He cannot appeal that designation because that window of opportunity is not open to him.  Is there not an onus on the Department, first, to notify farmers directly rather than by publishing advertisements in the newspapers and, second, to explain to farmers what the designation means?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s first question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It was introduced during 2001.  For nine years the farming community should have been aware that some of their lands were designated.  There has been an opportunity over a nine-year period.  In addition, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has notified through radio, television and newspaper advertising, and through the provision of maps in public places such as libraries, Garda stations and other public utilities, that these areas are designated.  As a former member of a local authority, I might point out to Deputy Naughten that SACs would also have been applied in the ongoing provision and changes in county development plans.  Every effort has been made by the Department to notify individuals of this designation.</P>
        <P>The three farming organisations were made aware of the difficulties when they were met on 31 October.  It was made quite clear to them at that time that what had gone on in the past could no longer apply.  We got a reasoned opinion, as of 18 October, which clearly set out to us that unless some action was taken in terms of finalising the designation, this country would be subject to serious fines.  Such has been the case in France and Greece.  It is of substantial concern to this <Col N="656"/>country that we would get this matter in its proper perspective and that we would abide by the provisions of the directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that the main delay in processing appeals has been the delay by the Department and its agents in furnishing documentation to the appeals committee?  Is it appropriate to put a map in a library and in a Garda station where the vast majority of the population do not visit on a regular basis, and does that satisfy the criteria in providing public notification to farmers?</P>
        <P>Is it not the case that there are numerous examples throughout the country of where areas of land have been designated, which are a significant distance from what people believe is the SAC, and of where there is no scientific basis for it?  In fairness, the appeals committee has taken those parcels of land out of the designation.  As farmers were given no notification, this decision was literally taken overnight.  Is it not the case that when the Minister of State met the three farming organisations on 31 October, they expressed their strong objection to bringing in this decision literally overnight without giving farmers the opportunity to make a formal appeal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the nine-year period, where the Department was aware of the ownership of land, all the people concerned were written to.  In certain instances there might be a question over the ownership of certain parcels of land and to make contact with those people, all the other devices of making that information available were used &mdash; the media, public notices and maps in public places.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In addition, we used a process whereby we had access to all the land holdings known to the Department of Agriculture and Food.  As a result, we were able to make contact with each of the owners of the parcels of land.  Over that period 1,500 appeals were lodged by farmers, which seems to suggest they were very much aware of the opportunity to appeal within a three-month period.  I can confirm that we will examine and honour all those appeals and we hope to have done that by year end.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> the anticipated effect of the national water pricing policy which will result in a new countrywide consolidated charge for water services; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[42570/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no proposals for a new countrywide consolidated charge for water services.  Each of the 34 city and county local authorities have financial and management autonomy in their functional areas, and will con<Col N="657"/>tinue to operate individually, in the setting of water charges for non-domestic users.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s water pricing policy envisages full and transparent cost recovery of water services supplied to the non-domestic sector.  Cost recovery from the non-domestic sector is to be achieved by way of a consolidated, meter-based volume charge to be applied within the functional area of the relevant authority.  I envisage that local authorities will have completed the metering of all non-domestic water users by the end of 2007.  The effect of this will be to enable local authorities to measure the amount of water supplied to each non-domestic water connection, thus providing a transparent and equitable cost recovery mechanism for non-domestic water services in accordance with the polluter pays principle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I should point out that the question was misspelled.  It should have referred to countywide, rather than countrywide, charges.  I apologise in that regard.</P>
        <P>If counties have not completed their water metering programme, they do not have to apply the county at large charge in 2007.  It is inequitable that the same circumstances do not apply in every county.  Until it does, it can be deemed unfair that it applies to certain counties like, for example, County Louth.</P>
        <P>Where non-domestic users in towns such as Drogheda and Dundalk had water and sewerage charges applied, users in Ardee and Dunleer paid water charges only.  This year, users in Ardee and Dunleer will have to pay water and sewerage charges and this involves a significant increase &mdash; up from 80 cent per cubic metre to &euro;1.55 per cubic metre.  This will have a significant and adverse impact on some communities whereas other communities in other counties do not pay this county at large charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Individual councils control these matters.  The current system of volume charges can be very unjust to individual users.  One will find people paying higher charges than necessary if they are charged simply on the volume of water that enters their system.  Some councils have also made a single charge for &ldquo;water in and waste out&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The installation of meters is the only way to achieve equitable charging for non-domestic water users.  I understand that metering is well advanced.   The Deputy mentioned County Louth and I understand that it has almost completed its metering programme.  We expect the balance of the country will be metered by the end of this year or early next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>If the metering programme is not completed in a county, the consolidated county at large charge does not apply and businesses will therefore pay the same this year as they paid last year.  However, where the metering programme <Col N="658"/>has been completed, users in towns outside major urban areas which have a separate rating capacity now face a doubling in the charge they paid last year.   Non-domestic users in other counties are getting away completely.  These charges are being applied as a result of the directive the Minister issued.  I ask him to delay the directive for at least another year until all counties are in compliance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the specific case the Deputy has mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unusual and it is not equitable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wishes to send me a note, I will look into it.  It sounds like a perverse effect.  It is, of course, more equitable that everyone pays on the same basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister believe it is fair that farmers should be charged for individual meters?  In one instance, a farmer has been charged for the installation and running costs of 13 meters; 20% of farmers have to pay for more than five meters and the majority of farmers, especially those in the west, must pay for at least three meters.  Does the Minister think this is acceptable?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister believe the commercial users of water should have to pay for the leakage on the public element of that supply?  This can happen where the local authority, through a lack of investment, has allowed leakage to occur.  Should farmers and commercial users have to pay for the water that does not reach their places of work?</P>
        <P>An allocation of &euro;10 million was provided in the budget for the installation of equipment.  Does this help cover the cost of the installation of meters and the repair of leaks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that the increase in these charges, from 80 cent to &euro;1.55 in Louth as outlined earlier, will have a substantial, adverse effect on the competitiveness of businesses in those areas and seriously damage the economy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I previously received a reply from the Minister outlining the charges applied by each local authority and these varied from 60 <Col N="659"/>cent per unit to &euro;2.60 per unit.  Can the Minister account for this variance?  Is it an income generator, or is it only supposed to cover the cost of providing the service?  For example, Intel in my constituency is a major user of water and we must be aware of the impact charges would have on future industrial developments.</P>
        <P>Why has the installation of meters in new homes and apartment building been insisted upon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I previously asked the Minister about farmers with many separate water taps and he said he would look kindly on their circumstances.  A bill ranging from several hundred euros up to &euro;1,000 can be a heavy ongoing expense for farmers.  I hope he will reiterate his previous position.  Some farmers may keep stock indoors for half the year and do not use the water meters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start with the issue of multiple metering raised by Deputies Naughten and Cowley.  It is a specific problem, particularly in places like Sligo and parts of the west where there are multiple or fragmented holdings.  I have already indicated that I am favourably disposed to resolving that and will issue guidelines to local authorities.  More prudent attention could have been paid to this factor when some local authorities were establishing their charging systems.  As Deputies are aware, I do not like intervening in areas that I regard to be within the specific responsibility of local authorities.  The active functions and powers of local authorities have haemorrhaged to the centre for generations and I do not like that fact.  This is an area where local authority members have some responsibility and they should exercise it.</P>
        <P>That leads me to the points raised by Deputy Murphy.  There are inexplicable differences in charges from area to area and I was pleased to publish and circulate that information.  We have informed local authorities by circular that when they are striking their rates they should not, to take the point raised by Deputy Morgan, perceive it as some sort of cash cow to be milked.  They must ensure cost recovery because otherwise the burden will fall on the general taxpayer; it is right and proper that business should carry some of the cost.</P>
        <P>Deputy Naughten asked about fragmented holdings.  I will be issuing a circular in that regard.  I do not think the Deputy asked specifically whether it was fair that a person with a smallholding had to pay for up to 13 meters but the answer, in any case, is &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  That case should never have arisen and I will issue guidelines on abatement.  Local authority members can now make those decisions but there needs to be homogeneity.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked about the cost of running the scheme, including the cost of unac<Col N="660"/>counted-for water, which is a euphemism for the more common term, &ldquo;leaks&rdquo;.  We do not charge for the domestic element in this country but we charge for all other aspects of water services.  Irrespective of the charging system, and bearing in mind that the domestic element is paid for by the general taxpayer, the full costs must be met.  However, a more significant issue arises with regard to leakage, in the reduction of which we have invested a lot of money in the past two years.  It is unacceptably high in some areas, for example it is more than 40% in the city of Dublin, which is an outrageous amount.  A small investment of capital to address the problem of unaccounted water, or leakage, in the past few years has reduced the level from over 42% to below 32% in Dublin.  That is the way forward and it is an issue we continue to press with local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no incentive for local authorities to deal with it.  It is paid for by local ratepayers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s conditional acceptance of Ireland&rsquo;s second national allocation plan, which was announced on 29 November.  This is the first stage in a process that will enable us to make a final decision on the allocation of allowances to operators in the emissions trading sector for the period 2008-12.  The Commission&rsquo;s approach to our plan recognises that Ireland was one of the few member states which carried out the allocation process correctly in the first national allocation plan in 2004 and we have followed the same approach in the second plan.</P>
        <P>The Commission has raised a number of issues in the plan, to which Ireland must respond by 31 December.  In particular, it considers that Ireland has not fully substantiated its proposals for Government purchases of carbon allowances, which I addressed in the D&aacute;il last week, and it expects transport emissions to increase by more than we have projected.  On foot of these concerns, the Commission seeks a reduction of 6.4% in our proposed allocation of allowances to the emissions trading sector.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>In my response to the Commission, I will be able to provide considerably more substantiation of our arrangements for Government purchases.  Following the approval of the D&aacute;il on 30 <Col N="661"/>November, I signed a contract with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for &euro;20 million to secure carbon allowances.  Last Friday, I published the Carbon Fund Bill 2006 and this is scheduled for Second Stage debate on Thursday, 14 December.  I will seek D&aacute;il approval this week to enter into agreement with the World Bank with a view to an investment of a further &euro;20 million.  I have also responded on the question of transport emissions and on a number of issues of a technical nature which were raised by the Commission.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s response will inform the Commission&rsquo;s further consideration of our plan and I believe we will reach agreement on an allocation closer to what was originally proposed in final discussions with the Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the Minister must make the submission by 31 December but I wish to ask about the transport allowances to which he referred.  The Minister for Finance made specific reference in the budget last week to the fact that he intended to review the manner in which car tax is paid, moving away from the current system based on cubic capacity to one based on emissions.  Will that form part of the submission the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, will make? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that the Commission&rsquo;s approach to the transport allocation is correct.  The national allocation plan, when read with the ICF Consulting-Byrne &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh report of 2006 which underpins it, very clearly sets out information on projections, policies and measures for the transport sector.  These do not appear to have been fully taken into account.  I held only a very brief conversation with the Commissioner but I will make that point.  I will also draw the Commissioner&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the transport sector is clearly dealt with in Ireland&rsquo;s Pathway to Kyoto Compliance, which was drawn to the attention of the Commission following its publication.</P>
        <P>In general, the Commission&rsquo;s response to Ireland&rsquo;s second national allocation plan was very positive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has always proclaimed itself a low-tax Government, but it has introduced a raft of stealth charges and new taxes in the past few years.  Last week in the budget, the health levy was increased by 25%, there was an increase in the cost of private beds in public hospitals and the Government voted through a measure requiring 5% of the notional value of a person&rsquo;s home to be assessed for the purposes of a claim for subvention.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, we saw the introduction of a new death tax on the elderly.  It appears the Government intends to wash its hands entirely of the future care of the elderly, those who built up this country, worked in far more difficult times than now and paid their taxes and PRSI, but now find they will be subject to a death tax after they have gone, in some cases requiring the sale of the family home.  The Government&rsquo;s proposal is built on three pillars, namely, an inspectorate regime for nursing homes, community services and this funding proposal.  The Government seems com<Col N="663"/>pletely unaware of what is happening in respect of the provision of community services.  It is some years since those in psychiatric institutions were abandoned in communities with no facilities to support them, but I see something similar happening now.</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that, in respect of the provision of community services for elderly people, we do not have sufficient general practitioners, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists or home helps?  To expect those services to be in place by 1 January 2008 is complete and utter fantasy.  If the Taoiseach has been unable to prevent the serious abuse of some elderly in some licensed nursing homes, where a monitoring regime is supposed to exist, how does he expect that a community service to look after those elderly who are semi-highly dependent can be put in place by that date?  How can he justify that as one of the fundamental pillars of this new programme, which also includes a death tax which was introduced yesterday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Providing safe and decent residential care for older people is one of our key long-term challenges.  As people live longer, the number who will need residential care will increase.  The Government&rsquo;s response is twofold.  We want to provide home help and qualified assistance to allow as many as possible to live as independently as possible and for as long as possible in their own homes.  An enormous range of measures has been put in place and funded in the recent past.  An outline has also been given by the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children of what they want to achieve in the short term.</P>
        <P>Second, we want to ensure that those who must go into residential care have the assurance of a quality place in a nursing home, where there is now a new and fair deal on how everybody pays.  Long-term issues facing us such as care for the elderly and pensions are very important.  As Deputy Kenny knows, the system that has been in place for the past decade and a half for supporting nursing home residents is deeply unfair.  People with the same means and care needs can face different costs in public and private homes.  We have decided on a new and fair deal for older people, a scheme that must be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In accordance with the agreement reached through the lengthy discussions on Towards 2016, the scheme will ensure the same level of support for public and private nursing home residents and involve co-payments between care recipients and the State.  Unlike the current system, it will ensure <Col N="664"/>that care is affordable for all and no one will be asked to sell or mortgage his or her home to pay for care.</P>

        <P>The persons who will need nursing home care in the next ten to 15 years are those who worked in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, built the Celtic tiger enjoyed by the Taoiseach and paid their taxes and PRSI.  They find themselves in a situation whereby the State says that this proposal, which is supposedly revenue neutral, will leave a legacy of a new death tax of 15%.  It will not be acceptable at a time of such economic strength when the T&aacute;naiste says that the &euro;2.4 billion received by the Government is not necessary.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I want to raise the issue of an innocent young plumber&rsquo;s assistant who was murdered today in broad daylight.  This case follows a situation when, four days ago, a post office worker was shot dead on the streets of Kilkenny during an armed robbery.  Three weeks ago a young, separated mother was shot on her own doorstep.  A few months ago Donna Cleary was shot at a party.  This year there have been 23 gun murders &mdash; there were many other murders &mdash; the highest number in the history of the State.  Fianna F&aacute;il made such a row and many of us remember Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue in 1998 when in the first year of the Government of the two parties opposite there were four gun murders.  Since January 1998, there have been 120 gun murders, 30% of which saw proceedings commenced and 15.8% a conviction.  That is the record.</P><Col N="669"/>
        <P>I remind the House of the pledge made by the Taoiseach in 1997 when he said he would make the fight against crime his priority in the new Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  He put the Fianna F&aacute;il message in five simple words to the drugs barons and criminal gangs: we will not accept this, he said, they would no longer be allowed hold sway over our communities.  They would not live in luxury with impunity because Fianna F&aacute;il had a plan for them: to arrest them, prosecute them and put them out of business.</P>
        <P>Compare that with the reality now.  We have a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who will advise on any aspect of human affairs at the drop of a hat but this is the reality in his portfolio.  What was his reaction last Sunday?  He blamed the judges.  He said the Judiciary is to blame because it will not implement his mandatory sentencing.  He blames whoever is near at the time.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that drugs are driving this crime wave?  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge there is a crisis in policing and crime?  If he does not accept that, how many more killings must there be for the Government to acknowledge there is a crisis and to put the relevant measures in place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I utterly condemn the barbaric and senseless killings in Finglas today as well as the tragic slaying of Alan Cunniffe on Friday in Kilkenny.  What else can I add to what I have said about some of the recent other murders?  I said here two weeks ago when a mother was shot in Swords that there have been too many gun murders.  This year there has been 23 to date, with 21 last year.  Two years ago, there was a small figure, nine, although one is too many.  There have been two bad years, I will not say anything else, with 44 murders.  The figure has increased from nine to 23 this year.</P>
        <P>What are we doing and what can we do?  Deputies can be assured that a major Garda operation is underway to deal with the perpetrators of the Finglas murders.  The T&aacute;naiste has spoken to the Garda Commissioner and senior garda&iacute; today.  A senior, experienced garda has been put in charge of the investigation.  I have seen some of the details but I am constrained from giving information.  The T&aacute;naiste, however, will give further details later.</P>
        <P>I extend my sympathies to the families concerned.  The fact that one of the victims was a young apprentice going about his work makes his murder doubly horrific, if that is possible.  The T&aacute;naiste and the garda&iacute; have clearly stated that no stone will be left unturned in hunting down the killers in any of these murders.  I assure the House there is no question of a lack of resources or laws.  Deputy Rabbitte knows there is plenty of legislation on the Statute Book and there are <Col N="670"/>sentencing procedures to deal with these issues.  The issue is to apprehend those responsible.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil has been in place for the last year and a half to deal with this sort of drug-related crime, which most of these murders are, although some of them involve internal conflicts between gangs and individuals concerned.  Operation Anvil has a large number of garda&iacute; dedicated to dealing with this issue.  In doing so, there have been 56 arrests for murder since the unit was established, with 800 arrests for robbery, 1,700 arrests for burglary and 800 for serious assaults.  They have arrested almost 3,400 in that operation alone.</P>
        <P>In recent months, Operation Oak, an intelligence operation, was undertaken by a large number of garda&iacute; to target gangs and individuals.  It may not be news to the House, but a large proportion of the resources of Operation Oak targeted the individual murdered today.  Many detectives were involved in that operation because of the activities of that individual.</P>
        <P>I regret that these things happen.  They are drug-related and gang-related and the laws are there but the resources in place for both Operation Anvil and Operation Oak, which are focussed on the man murdered today, did not stop these murders from happening.  That cannot deter the garda&iacute;, however, who must continue their efforts to the best of their professional ability using the resources they have been given to deal with these gangs and individuals, particularly those who have been engaged in disputes for the last 18 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach may well say we have plenty of laws but the average, law abiding citizen is concerned that we have plenty of deaths as well, plenty of killings, a huge increase in the crime wave, falling detection rates and communities ravaged by drugs and drug pushers.  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>When we think about the clich&eacute; uttered by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he came before the House two years ago to tell us that we had just experienced the last sting of the dying wasp, it was reported as a colourful remark from the boring Minister, but should someone with that sort of judgment be in charge of this portfolio, someone who told this House in all gravity that this was the last sting of the dying wasp?</P>
        <P>There has been a swarm of wasps since and this Minister does not seem to have any grasp of the reality of life in communities afflicted by the drugs menace.  He does not seem to understand that there is not a town or village that is not affected by the drugs menace.  He does not seem to understand that most of this vicious crime is driven by drugs.  A plumber&rsquo;s apprentice was shot down in broad daylight in his place of work.  The Taoiseach made a remark but one can never <Col N="671"/>know whether he meant it or it was a slip of the tongue.  He said whatever about the other murders, these are terrible today.  There is an attitude that while a gangland member is killing a gangland member, the rest of us will put up with it but the fear was expressed so frequently that one of these days, one of these gangland killings would involve an innocent citizen, which is exactly what happened earlier.  A young apprentice was shot down in his place of work this morning, presumably casually, because he could have been a relevant witness to the crime.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to say he is turning over stones, we have plenty of laws and it is terrible this is happening.  Somebody needs to get a grip on this situation.</P>

All murders, regardless of who is involved and the circumstances, are barbaric and senseless killings.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The overall figures show significant reductions in many areas but with regard to gun murders over recent years, mainly due to a war between various gangs, the number of deaths annually increased from nine to 21 last year and 23 so far this year.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness to the garda&iacute;, in a short period they have arrested more than 3,400 people.  A large number have been sentenced or are on remand.</P>
        <P>It is fair of the public or Deputy Rabbitte to ask how about some of these individuals.  I also ask this question but 55 detectives were working on Operation Oak, which targeted significant effort at the individual murdered earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>He was still shot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Time and again, that individual and related activities were highlighted.  His name has come up in connection with several serious incidents over the past year and while 55 garda&iacute; were involved in that operation, the issues surrounding him were not resolved and he was gunned down earlier.  Operation Oak was trying to deal with him and a small group of others properly before the law.  As a civil society, which <Col N="673"/>totally opposes such acts, he was dealt with by those with whom he was in conflict.  That is dangerous for all of us.  All we can hope is that the garda&iacute; who are intensely involved with the various gangs can have better success than they have had.  This involves an intricate web of activity across the city but it does not involve many people.  It is no good my saying there have been enormous numbers of convictions against these gangs.  Their members are well known and the name of the individual murdered today was mentioned in every briefing I have heard over the past year or more.  I refer to the criminal, not the innocent person.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>A helpless, hopeless, hapless response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure whether the Taoiseach saw &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; on RTE last night, which made me very angry, but he can indicate whether he did.  We can all be angry about people being forced to live 50 miles from where they work because they cannot afford a house any closer.  However, the behaviour of the gombeen men and racketeers who give auctioneers and estate agents a bad name angered me the most because of their unethical, criminal and downright two-faced dealings with vulnerable, hard pressed and cash strapped clients.  As the programme continued, it emerged that the activity being reported and shamefully exposed is the result of the Government&rsquo;s inaction on a number of clear failings in the industry.  For example, false bidding at an auction continues quite legitimately, yet if one did this in Australia, one would be put behind bars.  False information is regularly provided about the floor size of a property to make it look bigger in its description but if that happened in the US, it would be a criminal offence.</P>
        <P>Is protection being provided for the industry that was exposed last night?  Are certain activities permitted as long as estate agents, auctioneers or the Government parties receive a cut of the action at the Galway Races?  It is impossible to understand how such an obvious omission in law is not being tackled by the Government.  The estate agency review group recommended an independent regulatory authority.  Will the Government put that into effect so that com<Col N="674"/>plaints can be followed up and the conflict of interest reported last night can be clearly legislated for and prevented?  Will the Taoiseach introduce legislation to end false bidding and the false disclosure of information and to prosecute individuals who engage in clear breaches of data protection law similar to those exposed last night?  The Taoiseach has a job to do.  When will he do it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy raised two issues.  The auctioneering/estate agency review group submitted a report last year.  We subsequently approved preparation of a scheme for a Bill to give effect to its central recommendations, including the key recommendation to establish a regulatory authority with licensing and consumer protection functions.  That legislation is due shortly.  Pending enactment of the legislation, preparatory arrangements for the establishment of the new authority are under way.  A chief executive designate has been appointed and is engaged in the preparatory work.  The office for the new authority is located in Navan, County Meath.</P>
        <P>I was told today that, following last night&rsquo;s programme, the Data Protection Commissioner, accompanied by the Financial Regulator, has met associations representing mortgage brokers to discuss the allegations raised.  I understand that the Data Protection Commissioner has taken very seriously the information brought to his attention by the programme.  He has launched an investigation into the allegations of improper relationships and the disclosure of information from mortgage brokers to estate agents seeking to force extra money from bidders.  This investigation began yesterday with the inspection of a mortgage broker where information pertinent to the investigation was seized and is now under examination.</P>
        <P>These powers already exist in statute.  This morning an inspection took place on the premises of the firm of south Dublin auctioneers.  The commissioner reported to the Government that he is determined to use his statutory powers of inspection and enforcement to clamp down on these issues, if they are proven.  He will act in close co-operation with the Financial Regulator, which authorises mortgage brokers under the terms of the Consumer Credit Act, an Act which bestows legal powers in such cases.  The commissioner is calling on individuals who believe the law has been broken to report such breaches to the Office of the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>The Data Protection Commissioner and the Financial Regulator have substantial powers of investigation to address this issue and are investigating the issues raised in last night&rsquo;s programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked a number of questions that the Taoiseach did not answer in his response.  I <Col N="675"/>asked when legislation will be introduced to stop false bidding and require truthful disclosure.  Such matters require law, not merely independent regulation or a regulatory authority.  The Taoiseach has had nearly ten years to deal with these matters.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank suggests that house prices are over-valued by 14%.  The Taoiseach has pumped up prices through various forms of property tax relief and by talking up the market.  Why does the Taoiseach continue to tolerate racketeering scams when he has the power to address the matter?  He could give a signal to indicate the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will not be as welcoming of corporate donations as it has been.  How much of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party&rsquo;s funding comes from auctioneers, estate agents and developers who set up management companies and walk away from unfinished estates?  Is an ethical yardstick used before such funding is accepted, because I think it has a bearing in this matter?</P>

We subsequently approved preparation of legislation giving effect to the report&rsquo;s central recommendations and that legislation is before Government.  Pending the enactment of the required legislation we have applied the substance of the review group&rsquo;s recommendations and put in place preparatory arrangements for the new regulatory authority.  We have established an executive chairperson and the office is based in Navan.  I hope this is clear to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the insensitive manner in which subscribers to the refuse service in County Mayo are being left without such a service from Mayo County Council and are being given only ten days to source an alternative, private refuse collection service.  There is no provision of a waiver for old and impoverished people.  I wish to discuss whether this abdication of responsibility by Mayo County Council and the move from a public to a private refuse collection system mark the death-knell for local government in Mayo.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the totally unacceptable situation at St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Virginia, County Cavan, where 315 pupils are accommodated in a school built for 160.  Five classes, some in prefabs, have more than 30 pupils, with more than 35 pupils in three classes.  There is no accommodation for the principal, only one toilet for 17 female teachers and seven prefabs cover most of the play area.  This situation is an example of a failure to plan in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government housing section and in the Department of Education and Science.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need to establish a national database of rogue developers.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, recently informed <Col N="678"/>me that section 9 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 does not enable planning authorities to rely on information supplied by others, including a centrally maintained list, when refusing planning permission to those with histories of non-compliance.  This means planning authorities have no way of knowing what compliance record an applicant has outside their area.  The legislation is either flawed or has been incorrectly read and, in the interests of consumer protection, a national database of rogue developers needs to be established immediately.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I could refer to a number of matters.  The Farrell Grant Sparks report on matters pertaining to No. 20 cost &euro;250,000.  That report has not yet been debated in the House, which is a shame given the consequences for inland fisheries of the decision made by the Government on ending driftnet fishing are important in terms of the work that needs to be done on the role and responsibilities of the Central Fisheries Board, if it is to continue, and the overlapping of responsibilities among regional fisheries boards.  I object to No. 20, therefore, because we have not discussed that important report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also oppose No. 20 and, in particular, the postponement of elections to regional fisheries boards, for similar reasons to those set out by Deputy Kenny.  We expected to have the regional fisheries authority Bill before the House by Christmas.  However, it is now being said in the responsible Department that the legislation will not be introduced by this Government and that the key decisions about inland fisheries will be left for the next Government.  It seems most undemocratic that regional fisheries organisations will be left in a limbo over the next year because of this postponement.  I oppose No. 20 for that reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Each of these matters deserves debate, with No. 20 deserving our particular attention in light of the Farrell Grant Sparks report.  The future of fisheries is clearly perilous.  This omnibus approach does not suggest the Government is paying attention or being accountable to the House on these matters.  No. 20, which <Col N="681"/>is to be taken as part of a general omnibus, highlights the irrelevance of the House to people outside if this is how they think we deal with our business.  We should deal with each of these matters separately.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the proposal to send No. 19 to committee without debate because these regulations, which purport to govern the treatment of persons in Garda custody, have been in place since 1987.  No. 19 provides for only a minor adjustment given that the regulations pre-date the events uncovered by the Morris tribunal in County Donegal and many of the deaths which occurred in custody, including that of Terence Wheelock.  These regulations are, therefore, dangerously ineffective, as has been proven by the many grave abuses which have been commit<Col N="682"/>ted in custody since 1987, including the Dean Lyons case.  These regulations need to be radically overhauled rather than sent to committee without debate.  There should be a full debate in the House on this issue, to take account of the recommendations of Mr. Justice Morris and the recommendations made by the likes of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Irish Human Rights Commission, which was established after these regulations were initiated in 1987.  I urge the House to ensure this is not referred to the committee without debate.  The House should debate some proper amendments and changes to the regulations to give effect to the recommendations.</P>

	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 1 agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Since last September the House has had to be adjourned on a number of occasions because of the lack of legislation coming from the Government.  Now, in the week before we rise for Christmas, we have a 29 page Bill which, while the Labour Party agrees in general with its content, is quite complex providing for a new levy system for business and changes in the way in which rates are levied on start-up businesses.  If ever a Bill required a proper Committee Stage consideration this one <Col N="684"/>does, not a guillotined debate that will finish an hour and half from now.  There is, for example, a new formula in the Bill for the liability on rates which states that it will be A x B + C where C is D x E + F but the A and B is a different A and B to the A and B provided for in section 211 of the principal Act.  I do not know if Members on the Government side of the House will be able to explain to businesses in the new year that this legislation was passed in an hour and a half and that we all understand what it means.  This Bill requires a proper Committee Stage debate and on behalf of the Labour Party I oppose the guillotine to take all Stages by 7 p.m.</P>

        <P>As the festive season beckons, I am pleased to bring before the D&aacute;il the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Bill 2006.  The Bill has already been passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann having benefited from a wide-ranging and worthwhile debate on its provisions in the Seanad.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide the legislative framework for the operation in Ireland of business improvement district schemes.  It will introduce two technical amendments to the rating and valuation systems that will terminate an anomaly between these two codes and introduce more equity into the rating system.</P>
        <P>Business improvement district schemes have been in operation for many years.  A BID scheme can be described as an organisational and financing mechanism with legal backing through which businesses can develop and implement initiatives in defined areas to improve those areas for the betterment of the trading environment.</P>
        <P>Essentially, in a BID scheme a group of businesses come together and decide first that they want enhanced services, a wider range of services, new facilities or new activities in an area.  Second, these businesses decide that they are willing to <Col N="691"/>pay for such services, facilities or activities.  A specially established BID company is charged with responsibility for implementing the provisions of the BID scheme.  The local authority plays a key role in such a company.  In addition, the local authority collects the annual BID contributions that fund the scheme.</P>
        <P>Originating in Toronto, Canada in 1971, business improvement district schemes are now in operation in many cities and towns throughout the world.  It is estimated that there are more than 400 BID type schemes in operation in Canada and the United States.  BID schemes are becoming increasingly popular in Europe.  In the United Kingdom, for example, a legislative framework for BIDS was put in place in 2003.  In so far as the UK is concerned, 42 BID ballots have taken place to date, of which 34 have been successful.  The type of BIDS vary from town centre BIDS to mixed use, leisure, commercial and industrial BIDS and vary in location from Bolton to Liverpool to Swansea.  In London alone, 12 BID schemes have been approved to date.</P>
        <P>A wide range of activities can be carried out under a BID scheme, ranging from street cleaning, hospitality, promotions and special events to the provision of street furniture, signage and special lighting.  A fundamental feature of the legislation is that the geographical boundary of a business improvement district and the range of services and improvements to be carried out in the district are determined by the business community.  Thus, the business community, rather than central or local government, is the sponsoring party for BID schemes.</P>
        <P>BIDS will represent a new and unique partnership arrangement between business and local government.  While occasional tensions exist between local government and the business sector, important advances have been made in recent years in terms of formal partnership arrangements.  A number of structures are now in place at local authority level which facilitate direct input by business into the development of policy at local level.  Strategic policy committees at county and city level and municipal policy committees at town level are providing a direct channel for engagement by business in local authority areas.  These changes have made a positive impact.  Chambers Ireland has been very proactive in engaging with local authorities through these structures and local government has benefited greatly from this interaction.  The BIDS will further enhance current partnership arrangements at local government level.</P>
        <P>An important point I want to emphasise is that the services in a BID scheme will be additional to, not a substitute for, the services already being provided by the local council.  I have included important benchmarking provisions in the Bill <Col N="692"/>which will ensure that the level of services provided by a local council will be fully quantified in advance of a BID scheme being developed.  These provisions will allay any concerns that local authorities might reduce the level of existing services following the introduction of a BID scheme.</P>
        <P>In developing the provisions of the Bill, extensive consultation has been carried out with a wide range of interested parties. As key partners in BIDS, it was essential that early engagement took place with local authorities on this new and novel concept.  In November 2001, my Department circulated local authorities with a draft framework for the operation of business improvement districts in Ireland.  The concept of BIDS was outlined in the accompanying documentation.  The observations of local authorities provided at the time were extremely useful in the further development of the framework.</P>
        <P>There is also considerable engagement with the business community.  The Dublin City Business Association in particular has been to the forefront in this regard<b>.</b></P>
        <P>I would like to set out for the House the main elements of the Bill and the principal issues associated with the development, running and financing of a scheme.  Given the link between local government and BIDS, the legislative framework for BIDS will be incorporated into the Local Government Act 2001.  The BID provisions are contained in section 4 of the Bill as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The Bill inserts 20 new sections into the 2001 Act and these are numbered sections 129A to 129T.  For ease of reference in discussing the Bill, I will refer to the new section numbers as they appear in the 2001 Act.</P>
        <P>Section 129C provides that people wishing to undertake a business improvement district scheme must submit a proposal to the local authority for approval.  The section sets out in detail the elements that must form part of a BID proposal.  These include the boundary of the proposed BID area; a description of the objectives to be achieved under the scheme; a detailed description of the scheme itself specifying each project, service and work to be carried out or provided; the timeframe for operation of the scheme; details of the BID company which would be responsible for administering and managing the scheme; details of the current level of services being provided by the local authority; and details of the income and expenditure for the scheme.  In addition, the proposal must include a current list of each rateable property in the proposed BID area.</P>
        <P>In practice, the development of a proposal will require the BID proponents and the local authority to work together in a partnership approach.  A key to the ultimate success of any BID proposal will be the extent to which there is meaningful engagement with the public and business <Col N="693"/>community in an area.  The Bill sets out a framework for such comprehensive consultation.  In the first instance, a BID proposal submitted to a local authority must be made available for public inspection under section 129D.  In response to an Opposition amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad, I brought forward an amendment which provides that a BID proposal may be made available on the Internet.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>Following publication of a BID proposal, the local authority must, by way of public notice, invite submissions from the public on the proposal.  Following consideration of the submissions received, if the local authority is of the opinion that the BID proposal may be inconsistent with the interests of the local community, it must notify the BID proponents of the nature of the inconsistency.  Where the local authority notifies the BID proponents that there may be inconsistency with local community interests, this would represent a clear signal that the BID proposal needs to be reviewed.  Where any BID proposal is withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn under section 129F, the BID proponents will be liable for all costs incurred by the local authority regarding the proposal.</P>
        <P>Section 129G provides for the holding of a plebiscite to determine the level of support among ratepayers in the area.  The financing of a BID scheme is a matter for the business community.  It will involve the payment of an annual contribution by each business in a BID area.  It is vital, therefore, that all businesses have a formal say on whether a BID proposal is to proceed.  The plebiscite will be organised by the local authority.  In the BID plebiscite, each business will have one vote.  The vote of the corner shop is as valuable as that of the major department store.  This is important because a BID scheme must have widespread and popular support.  When a majority of the ratepayers who vote in the plebiscite vote in favour, the BID scheme can then be submitted for consideration by the local authority.</P>
        <P>Section 129I provides that a BID company will be responsible for implementing and managing a BID scheme.  The board of directors will be made up of businesses or their representatives and nominees of the local authority.  At least two thirds of the directors must be ratepayers or ratepayer representatives.  The Bill provides that where the board consists of fewer than 13 members, one will be selected by the elected council and one by the manager.  Where the board consists of 13 members or more, two will be selected by the elected council and two by the manager.</P>
        <P>I have given some thought to the balance of representation between local authority members and officials on a BID board.  I believe that the equal level of representation provided for in the Bill is appropriate.  Members of the councils have a clear role as policy makers and as guardians of <Col N="694"/>the public interest, while the official representation is desirable in view of the high level of interaction which will take place with the BID proponents in the development and implementation of a BID scheme.</P>
        <P>The BID company adopts a budget for the forthcoming year.  The amount of the levy on any individual business is determined by the rateable valuation of that business.  The local authority collects a BID contribution levy from each business in the BID area.  The Bill provides for relief of 50% of the amount of the levy where a property is unoccupied.  Current rating law contains similar provisions on rate refunds where a property is unoccupied.  In effect, the 50% rate will apply where no income is being derived from a property and this is an equitable provision.</P>
        <P>Two important provisions, which are not related to BIDs, deserve a mention.  Section 5 provides that owners of newly erected properties will be liable to pay a levy to local authorities from the date the properties are entered on the valuation list.  This ends an effective rating holiday which existed because of the inflexibility of current arrangements and increases equity in the rating system.  Section 6 provides for an amendment to the Valuation Act 2001.  Section 56 of that Act sought to ensure that the revaluation process, to be carried out by the Valuation Office, would not lead to disproportionate gains in rates income by local authorities in the year following a revaluation.  The primary aim was to limit any negative consequences for the business community.  In limiting the amount of income a local authority could raise through rates in the year following revaluation, section 56 did not provide for the rates buoyancy from new properties to accrue to local authorities.  Section 6 addresses this anomaly.</P>
        <P>I will table an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to provide that local authority audit committees can operate in line with best practice.  I will deal with this issue in more detail on Committee Stage</P>
        <P>The Bill provides an innovative framework for businesses and local authorities to work together for the betterment of towns and cities throughout the country.  Research on the operation of BIDs in the USA has indicated that they provide a vehicle for innovative and proactive management of an area and yield significant positive impacts on the economic vitality and viability of cities and towns.  All investment made through BIDs will be additional and complementary to the current level of services provided by the local authority.  Investment under BIDs will leverage further investment into BIDs and surrounding areas as a consequence of the goodwill and impetus which will be generated by such schemes.  There has been a broad welcome for this Bill across all sectors.  I am grateful for the cross-party support for the Bill during its passage through Seanad <Col N="695"/>&Eacute;ireann and I look forward to similar support today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>A unique partnership is proposed in this Bill.  The idea comes from the United States, where it has worked successfully in a number of cities.  It has also been used in Canada and the UK and now it is being introduced here.  In principle, I favour the proposition that money other than the normal expenditure of a local authority, with the consent of commercial ratepayers, may be used in projects to improve their community.  Such projects would include the improvement of signage, the removal of graffiti or even more high profile projects, but I have some serious questions and, in view of the fact that this Bill will be law in an hour, we have been given inadequate time to discuss it.  Nonetheless, we are in favour of the Bill in principle.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposal states that the majority of ratepayers, each of them having one vote, will decide whether a bid goes through.  My research shows that in the UK, a two-part process exists that is not in this Bill.  First, a majority of those voting must vote in favour.  Second, the total rateable value of the properties of those voting in favour must be more than that of those voting against.  Therefore, an in-built balance exists which is not in this Bill.</P>
        <P>The chambers of commerce welcome the Bill and are very much in support of it.  They have been anticipating this Bill for more than four years and it is a significant step for the funding of local services.  Therefore, I am coming from the point of view of those who want this Bill to work and who favour it in principle.  I ask the Minister to examine the situation in the United Kingdom, where there is a second check and balance provision regarding ratepayers.  The problem is that communities in Ireland are different from those in the United States and the United Kingdom, where there are many more cities than towns and large centres of population.  In places such as Dublin, this could be a very dynamic and useful operation where there are many successful businesses.  However, further down the line, we need to be very careful in Cork, Galway, etc, because while a number of people might be doing significant business, others might not.  The Minister must ensure that a consensus emerges rather than a dominant group which may have the economic power in this regard.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that what one pays is based on one&rsquo;s rateable valuation.  Nonetheless, I want to ensure that the Bill is as inclusive as possible and I ask the Minister to consider raising the bar from a simple majority to perhaps two thirds, which would achieve greater consensus.  If there is only a simple majority for the proposal, it might lead to conflict, pressure and so on.  I make this point in the context of supporting the Bill in principle while trying to improve it and make it more sus<Col N="696"/>tainable.  That is an important issue and I would appreciate it if the Minister would consider it on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister has announced he will insert an amendment, which we will have little time to discuss, about the audit committees of the council.  In terms of auditing local authority financing, I presume this applies to all of the business of the council across the board, not just the BID proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, the issue is how local authorities and elected members look at what the council is doing financially &mdash; how it exercises its power.  I have found in the past that they are very reluctant to exercise their power.  I have always argued that there ought to be a finance committee that meets quarterly at least with the finance officers of a local authority to ensure that the budget is what it says it is and to go through all the financial proposals from each department in the council before the final proposal is put before councillors, which is happening as I speak.  The problem is that councillors tend to pass the estimates, having been given a lead as regards particular projects they might be interested in, but they do not deal with matters in minute detail.  I would like to see this happening and if that is the objective of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, I have no problem with it.  However, I have an issue as regards local government finances generally and value for money.  One of the problems is that the auditing of the accounts is done by the local government auditor, but they are not presented or laid before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
        <P>As a further step I would like to see, in terms of the transparency and openness of local authority funding and expenditure, that having gone through the democratic process of the council, it would be laid before the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts so that issues which specifically relate to value for money in local government might be examined.  I do not know whether that is to be in the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, but I ask him to address that issue because it is very important that this should happen.</P>
        <P>Another issue that has arisen relates to the additional provisions of the Bill, as referred to by the Minister.  I will quote from his speech, but I am not sure whether the chambers of commerce have been consulted on this point.  I understand he has had consultation as regards the Bill as a whole, but I do not know whether this particular issue was addressed.</P>
        <P LI="1">Section 5 of the Bill provides that newly erected properties will be liable to pay a levy to local authorities from the date the properties are entered on the valuation list.  This ends an effective &ldquo;rating holiday&rdquo; which existed <Col N="697"/>because of the inflexibility of current arrangements and increases equity in the rating system.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understood that over ten years one paid an increasing proportion of the final rateable levy.  The first year 10% is paid, while 20% is paid the second year and so on.  Is the Minister proposing to do away with that position?  If so, I would be concerned.  For example, in the context of a start-up business which might not have much money and obtains family support or a small loan within the local community, it would now be faced with full rateable valuation from day one.  If that is what is being proposed, I am opposed to it on the grounds that it is a retrograde step.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides an amendment to the Valuation Act 2001.  I ask the Minister to explain those issues more clearly to me on Committee Stage.  I will support the Bill on Second Stage but I would like clarity as regards those other proposals.</P>
        <P>The last point I wish to make concerns an issue brought to my attention by Members in my party.  They want clarity regarding where the Minister talks about the work that the BIDs might do so that they do not perform activities which at present are being done by the local authority.  The point made to me by a number of Deputies was to the effect that the improvement or beautification of streets or footpaths in the business improvement district or on any lands buildings and other structures, such as the removal of graffiti, etc, is work which the local authority is obliged to carry out at present.  The Deputies have asked me to query where the Minister draws the line.  If it is a local authority with a poor rates base, as in some counties, will this be work, which should be done by a local authority which does not have the capacity to do it, that will fall on the business community?  This is an important point and needs clarification.</P>
        <P>Generally, I welcome the significant progress that can be made.  I welcome that the chambers of commerce are behind the principle of the Bill and the innovation legislation it represents.  I look forward to getting the clarifications I sought.  I need them before I can support the Bill on Committee and further Stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party is generally supportive of this Bill, but I very much regret the fact that we are being asked to pass it into law in about an hour&rsquo;s time because many aspects of it require teasing out in a normal Committee Stage discussion.  There are three essential elements to the Bill &mdash; the establishment of the business improvement districts and the procedures in that regard; changes in the rating and valuation system for new businesses; and the amendment the Minister is introducing in respect of audit committees in local authorities.</P>
        <P>In so far as the Bill is primarily concerned with rates and levies being paid by businesses to local <Col N="698"/>authorities for certain services, the legislation requires a greater deal of discussion than it will get today.  Frankly, the Government is being disrespectful to the business community, which is now the only section of Irish society to pay rates to local authorities.  It makes a very substantial contribution to the finances of local government.  As a matter of respect, while I appreciate that their representatives have been involved in consultation and that the chambers of commerce are broadly supportive of the legislation, a Bill dealing with a charging and levying regime for business deserves more consideration in this House than being rushed through the week before Christmas without a proper Committee Stage discussion.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I would like to have seen a number of areas teased out in a proper Committee Stage discussion.  One of the proposals for the adoption of the BID scheme, for example, is that it should be done by one third of the membership of the local authority.  I do not know where that threshold came from, but it is an area I would like teased out.  It seems a low threshold for such a serous proposal.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>There is an inconsistency as regards the provisions on the plebiscite and the way in which the levy is to be applied.</P>
      
        <P>My understanding of section 129G(4) is that where there is multiple occupancy of a premises, there will be only one vote.  Consequently, ratepayers who occupy part of such building will be obliged to agree among themselves how the vote is to be passed, even though the building might contain a number of separate rateable businesses.  However, when it comes to applying the levy, the businesses will each be levied separately.  This seems inconsistent and I would have liked Members to have teased out this issue.</P>
        <P>The levy will apply on a majority basis.  Businesses in a particular district will vote for it and it will then apply to everyone.  While I appreciate that the majority rules, I would have liked some discussion as to what might happen in a case where a significant minority might be opposed to it, but is faced with being levied for it.  In particular, I would have liked this issue to have been teased out in respect of circumstances in which the district might involve dominant businesses and in which pressure might be applied to businesses.</P>
        <P>I also would have liked to have teased out questions regarding circumstances in which the Bill might be used for purposes for which it was not intended.  The Minister&rsquo;s presentation stated it is for the upgrading of areas, by providing car parking or general improvements.  I put the following scenario, with which Deputy Cuffe is familiar, to the Minister.  At present, a proposal for a local area plan in Stillorgan is being prepared by the local authority.  Much of the old shopping centre in Stillorgan and adjoining properties have <Col N="699"/>been bought by a single developer who proposes to carry out his own local area plan.  What in this Bill can prevent the following scenario?  A developer who owns all the properties and who represents a majority of the ratepayers involved, proposes a BID scheme.  He or she then begins to create what effectively would be a local area plan, using the BID scheme as a back door method for so doing.  This matter should also have been teased out.  I know of many other cases, such as redevelopments of shopping centres, which can be quite controversial in a locality.  How can one avoid the BID formula being misused in such a manner?</P>
        <P>What becomes of people who are not ratepayers?  I cite D&uacute;n Laoghaire as an example.  A significant number of people live in the town, whose interests as to what might happen to the town may not always coincide with what is being advocated by business in the town.  All Members know of the conflicts that can arise in respect of matters such as car parking arrangements, traffic management, deliveries, the physical appearance of a town and similar issues, in which businesses may have one view while local residents might have another.  Under this formula, businesses obviously will have a vote on BID schemes because they will pay for it and will have the clout.  However, the only recourse for those who have lived in the town all their lives and who may have a different view would be to try to persuade members of the local authority not to proceed with the scheme.</P>
        <P>How will one ensure the BID levy will not act as a substitute for rates?  It is interesting that currently businesses are the only part of the economy that pay rates to local authorities.  This is a formula in which a new voluntary rate, if I may put it that way, will be added to businesses.  What safeguards exist to ensure businesses&rsquo; payments under a BID schemes will not be used to provide services that local authorities should have provided from the rates the former have already paid?</P>
        <P>I am concerned in respect of the provision for a local authority clawback in section 129K(6) which states: &ldquo;The rating authority may recover from the BID fund all reasonable costs it incurs in performing functions related to the BID scheme&rdquo;.  I wish to hear more regarding how one could prevent a local authority from getting greedy and taking too much back from the BID fund.  Moreover, there is a lack of clarity regarding the role of councillors and local authority officials on such boards.  The Minister&rsquo;s contribution noted they will be present as policymakers and as guardians of the public interest.  However, my understanding is that under the Bill, they will be directors of the company and will have obligations, as company directors, under company law which may not always coincide or rest easily with their func<Col N="700"/>tions as guardians of the public interest.  To whom will they owe their loyalty?  Are they, as company directors, required to comply with one set of rules and, as public representatives, to comply with a different set or to serve a different master?  There is a lack of clarity in this respect that must be dealt with.</P>
        <P>The formulae for the changing of rates and of the valuation system also requires more time to be teased out than is available this evening.  On the Order of Business, I drew attention to the rather complex algebra, to which Members are being invited to give approval, to give effect to the new rating regimes and to the limits on valuations and on rating payments.  Such subjects require some time to ascertain exactly what is meant.  For example, at some point all Members as legislators will be asked what is the liability for rates on a business in a particular set of circumstances.  Members are not being provided with an opportunity to have this issue elucidated and explained as it should be.  Rushing the Bill through in such a short time is no way to make law governing rates and valuations of businesses.</P>
        <P>The Minister has tabled an amendment in respect of audit committees for local authorities.  This morning, I read in a newspaper that this constitutes a new venture on the Minister&rsquo;s part and that the idea to have independent auditing and evaluation of local government financing is new.  However, it is nothing of the sort as section 122 of the Local Government Act 2001 already provided for the establishment of audit committees in local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not work for two reasons.  First, the Minister and the Department frustrated its operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not know when the Minister commenced the section to enable local authorities to establish audit committees, there was a long delay in so doing.  Second, it was frustrated at local level by local authority management, who did not wish to see the establishment of audit committees before which a local government auditor could be called and questioned.</P>
        <P>Section 122 of the Local Government Act provided for the equivalent of the Committee of Public Accounts to operate in local authorities.  It is a great pity Members lack the time to work through the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, which does not appear to strengthen this position at all.  If anything, it weakens the role of audit committees in local authorities.  At present, section 122 allows for the local government auditor to be brought before the committee in the same manner in which the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="701"/>attends the Committee of Public Accounts.  The latter is questioned, makes a report, explains what the audit means and so on.</P>
        <P>There are similar powers enabling the audit committee to bring before it council management and to have them questioned.  However, the Minister is replacing these provisions with a formula in which there will be a council committee that can discuss all kinds of matters, can review financial and budgetary reporting and foster the development of best practice.  However, it will have no teeth whereas the current section 122, if it was allowed to operate, does so.  If anything, the new formula proposed by the Minister, which he has touted in the media as representing a strengthening of financial accountability in local authorities, appears to be weakening its potential.  I use the term &ldquo;potential&rdquo; because I am conscious the audit committee idea never really got up and running in local authorities, as it should have.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment weakens rather than strengthens it.  I would like to see it strengthened and made effective and really operational.</P>
        <P>As far as the principle of this Bill in terms of the establishment of the business improvement districts is concerned, I can see the logic of what is being done with rates and valuations.  I have my doubts, which I have expressed, about the amendment on the audit committees that the Minister intends to propose.  I have no difficulty with the general thrust of the Bill and if this were a Second Stage debate in the normal sense, I would support it.  Unfortunately, we are being deprived of the opportunity to give the Bill the detailed scrutiny it needs and deserves.  The Minister is unwise in rushing this Bill through the House when there would have been general goodwill towards it and a general willingness to see it enacted, but also to have it properly considered, scrutinised and evaluated line by line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Although the business community is creative, entrepreneurial and dynamic, and I fully agree that such energy should be harnessed and local authorities have not necessarily been to the fore traditionally in capturing it, I am concerned at the manner in which the Minister is bringing forward legislation in the House today, the third last sitting day of the session.  Rushed legislation is almost inevitably flawed.  We must now go back and revisit the A case legislation from six months ago.  The concerns about which I argued then are now all being reiterated by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.  No doubt if the Minister, Deputy Roche, railroads this legislation through today or tomorrow, we will have to revisit it.</P>
        <P>Not only is this complex legislation being hammered through today, but the Minister is also throwing in some important amendments to the existing rates legislation.  It is a great deal to ask that we shove this through within the next 45 <Col N="702"/>minutes.  It is not the right way.  Frankly, it is disrespectful to the House.  This is not the way to put it through the House.</P>
        <P>On a wider issue, the organisations that are behind this Bill are worthy ones and have a significant amount of creative energy to add.  The Dublin City Business Association, through Mr. Tom Coffey, has added enormously to the debate about Dublin city.  I recall that ten or 15 years ago Tom gave me a copy of Richard Rogers&rsquo;s <i>A New London</i>, which contained a considerable number of great ideas about the city.  Chambers Ireland has also added to the discussion on accountability and the need for districts to be responsible.  That is all useful.</P>
        <P>Behind all this is my gut conviction that local authorities should be dealing well with these activities and I am very nervous about a bolt-on strategy to the existing local authority system.  There are perhaps two elephants in the corner in this regard.  The first is the Minister&rsquo;s denial of the adequate funding that local authorities should receive.  He is not providing it.  The second is the inflexibility of local authorities, whether that is due to inherited work practices or simply an inability to be dynamic and to respond to changing ideas and needs.  I passionately believe that local authorities should be to the forefront of change and we need to make them work well rather than clamp an extra framework onto them that, ironically, will make them more bureaucratic.</P>
        <P>If something needs to be fixed within local authorities, let us fix it but let us not simply add another layer to a process that is remarkably murky at present due to the changes that have been put upon the local authority system over the past ten years.  The strategy policy committees are difficult for the outsider to comprehend but if one thinks they are bad, the addition of business improvement districts will make it even more difficult to comprehend what is happening.</P>
        <P>I am also nervous of the examples that have been chosen.  Business improvement districts appear to be popular, both in the UK and the United States.  Frankly, our towns are not like Philadelphia, midtown Manhattan, Nottingham or Birmingham.  We are lucky enough to have inherited strong town centres, although these are under threat from out of town shopping due the changes wrought by the Minister whereby he opened the stable door to allow development elsewhere, whether on the Ballymun Road with IKEA or in getting rid of the cap on the size of shopping centres.  The Minister did something similar to what Margaret Thatcher did 20 years ago when he essentially gave <i>carte blanche</i> for development to take place outside the traditional town centres.  That was a retrograde step.</P>
        <P>Returning to the kind of issues that will be undertaken by business improvement districts and their boards, it is crucially important that we <Col N="703"/>get right issues such as street cleaning, street furniture, signage and special lighting.  Mr. Dick Gleeson, the chief planner in Dublin City Council, has referred to the public space of the city as being the living room.  That is a good comparison to draw.  When one looks at the floor as the footpath or pavement and the walls as the buildings, it is important that we get it right.  In Ireland, we went through a particularly bad phase over the past 30 years when we allowed second best to suffice.  The paving of Grafton Street with concrete bricks was a retrograde step.</P>

	<P>I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The bad aluminium street signs falling apart after 20 years were a retrograde step.  We need to rediscover good materials such as cast-iron signage and natural stone.  The examples I would look at are cities such as Ferrara and Bologna in Italy and Barcelona in Spain which do things well.  Such cities do not use business improvement districts.  They use the local authorities and they have reinvigorated them and given the power, ability and funding to deliver on improving the public space.  That is significantly important.</P>
        <P>I am tabling amendments to the Bill this evening.  One of the most important concerns the idea that we must work with the existing residential community as well.  I favour mixed use communities, that is, businesses and residential units in the same area.  It is important that we harness the know-how of those communities and allow the residents and communities representation.</P>
        <P>This is being rushed and I disagree with that process.  I am putting forward amendments to it.  Behind all of this is the need to give local authorities the power and clout they deserve.  Sadly, I do not think Fianna F&aacute;il and the Minister believe in it.  If the Minister did, he would put local authorities on a firm financial footing and that would really harness the creative energy which local communities and local businesses possess and which, if all hands were put to the wheel, would really deliver the best for local communities.  There are good examples of that, but they are against the odds.</P>
        <P>I worry that it could go dramatically wrong.  I look at one of the towns in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, Wicklow town, where businesses have sponsored seats and put their advertising onto them.  That is how one does it badly.  We need to do it well and I am not convinced that rushing through a Bill over the next 40 minutes will do that ultimately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the thrust and intention of the Bill.  We all want achievement of its objectives because we know that visual appearance is extremely important, not just on high <Col N="704"/>streets, but also industrial centres in urban and rural areas.  The Bill seeks to bring together people to efficiently and effectively produce a plan to enhance their area beyond a point which would be reasonable for public financing.  The concept of modern marketing is heavily dependent on image, although we should not underestimate the depth of the substance behind it.  Irish businesses are significantly improving their image.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the improvement or beautification of streets and footpaths in business improvement districts.  This can be achieved by grouping together, as described in the Bill, in a business improvement district.  This type of work could not be done by local authorities alone.  While local authorities strive to, for example, remove graffiti, they are rarely successful because that problem is prevalent in many areas.  It is not unreasonable that local businesses join together to deal with such issues.  I welcome the provision for the carrying out of studies and making of reports in respect of the business improvement district.</P>
        <P>The new section 129E proposed for Part 13A of the principal Act gives an opportunity for public input into the consultation process.  We are familiar with consultation processes in this State and I must sound a note of caution.  We have had such processes on issues such as incineration and road development, but they were paper exercises and the consultation was not heeded.  This causes me considerable concern.  Provision must be made for consultation.</P>
        <P>Section 129F allows the local authority to weed out what I can best describe as bluffers, namely, developers who will cause considerable expense to taxpayers or ratepayers in preparing material or working with the local authority to develop a scheme, but cry off at the last moment.  Section 129H provides for the cost of preparing for the scheme and ensures that it will not fall upon the local authority.  This is an important and welcome element of the Bill.</P>
        <P>However, I am concerned about section 5 and this has also been referred to by another speaker.  It states: &ldquo;It is necessary for the passing of a resolution under subsection (1) that at least one third of the total number of members of the authority concerned vote in favour of the resolution.&rdquo;  What happens if 60% of members vote against a resolution, 10% abstain and 30% vote in favour of it?  How stands the business improvement district in such circumstances?  I do not think the Bill is clear enough on this matter.  I welcome the fact that plebiscites are to be organised by the relevant local authority; no one in this State is as proficient in organising plebiscites as local authorities.</P>
        <P>I have a difficulty with water pricing policy.  When discussing business it is important that we mention not only marketing and image, but com<Col N="705"/>petitiveness too.  I am concerned that some local authorities have shown disregard for the effect of water pricing policy on competitiveness.  Businesses are expected to pay over the odds.  I acknowledge that the Minister said that he would try to ensure this does not happen.  Unfortunately, it is currently happening.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that we do not have more time to deal with this matter.  The framework of the Bill is fine and a couple of decent amendments would ensure that we could all accept it.  Unfortunately, we cannot do so as it stands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Like everyone else, I welcome the overall concept of this Bill.  I took particular notice of the Bill as it progressed through the Seanad.  Given that the D&aacute;il adjourned early several times in recent months, I do not know why we have such a short period to deal with this Bill.  At that time, the Government was not able to bring forward legislation, but all of a sudden this Bill has become hugely important business.</P>
        <P>I do not have a background in this area and I am not exactly sure how the issue will pan out.  The Bill gives an opportunity to businesses and others to progress matters in a communal manner in a particular area.  A number of factors would have to be in place for this to work.  Based on what is happening in Britain and the United States, critical mass is important.  I find it difficult to see how this will come about in a small town like Ballinasloe, for example.  There is no reason that it should not, but I imagine that it would have to be pioneered by an organisation as powerful as the Dublin Chamber of Commerce or some similar organisation.  It is worth giving this Bill a chance.  Assuming it is passed in its current form, I expect an organisation will pilot this in one of our cities, probably Dublin.</P>
        <P>I was a member of local authorities and have been a Member of this House for some time, and I have always found great tension between the business community and local authorities.  It should not be like that; everyone should be on the same path and should aim to bring about prosperity and the better delivery of services.  However, for some reason there is barely a town with a local council where there is not tension between it and the business community.  Perhaps when this concept was first mooted many years ago it was done with the intention of overcoming this problem.  If that could be achieved, it should be closely examined.  With the competition this county faces, there is no room for tension between local authorities and the business community &mdash; it is better that they sing from the same hymn sheet.  I assume that much of the tension arises from rows over rates and valuations.  Many people either think the money is not well spent or that they are too highly rated.  There is also the clear disparity between what is deemed commer<Col N="706"/>cial and social in a community.  These lines can be jarred on occasion.</P>
        <P>I note that the chambers of commerce are strongly behind the concept of this proposal.  There are likely to be big businesses in the areas where this will work best.  They tend to bring a lot of business and traffic into particular areas.  One could argue that they might have been the cause of extinguishing or diminishing existing businesses.  The Minister proposes checks and balances in the system of rateable valuations by the use of a mechanism preventing one anchor tenant controlling everything.  That is a very important provision as the proposals would not otherwise work.</P>
        <P>The Bill reminds me of the Leader programme in agriculture in the way it tries to bring together various features which increase productivity and beautify an area.  That is a very useful concept, provided it is handled correctly.</P>
        <P>I also understand the Minister proposes to amend the Valuation Act 2001.  Some businesses have low valuations and others high, which has been a vexed question for many years.  It can be assumed that any changes in valuations will be upwards &mdash; current high valuations will not be reduced and lower valuations will be increased, which will cause problems.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes to introduce outside audit experts to sit on existing boards, on strategic policy committees and on finance committees of county councils or local authorities.  I share the view of Deputy Gilmore on this matter.  Having been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for a few years, I always believed that local authorities should be brought under its remit.  I do not think many in the D&aacute;il would disagree, however, that local authorities have a good record on the question of misappropriation of funds.  Over the years there have been no major disasters and, while they may move slowly and lack imagination when proceeding with various projects, at least the books always seem to have been correct, for which I pay tribute to them.  Will the people who take up additional seats on the board become directors?  What responsibilities will they have?</P>
        <P>On the detail of a BID proposal, the Minister said: &ldquo;Following publication of a BID proposal, the local authority must, by way of public notice, invite submissions from the public on the proposal.&rdquo;  When summing up can the Minister say what will happen if the public objects to a proposal in large numbers?  What mechanism will deal with that?  It is very important the public be taken into account but, at the same time, a good project should not be jettisoned for a frivolous reason.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael, like most in the House today, supports the principle of the Bill and hopes the Minister provides answers to the many questions that have been asked.  He does not have much time <Col N="707"/>to convince us, however, for which he should be ashamed.  There is no excuse for that but we await his words of wisdom between now and 7 p.m.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Cowley.  I welcome this Bill.  There has been widespread support for business improvement districts, BIDs, since their emergence in the late 1960s or early 1970s in Toronto.  BIDs are essentially public private partnerships, to which we have become accustomed, in which property and business owners of a defined area decide to make a collective contribution to the maintenance, development, marketing and promotion of their commercial district.  The idea is similar to the promotion of a suburban shopping centre or mall, for which tenants must pay a maintenance fee.  Chambers of commerce have also come together to promote themselves and it is a very effective way of doing business.  I recall a supermarket being granted planning permission to open beside a small shop, prompting many objections from the small shop owner, fearing her business would be wiped out.  Eventually, she had to take on three or four more employees because of the increase in her trade.  There can be a fantastic spin-off for individuals if they approach such developments in the right way and realise there is strength in numbers.</P>
        <P>In the coming decade business improvement districts will develop more partnerships with residents and, in doing so, show more concern for open public space and community projects.  I, Deputy Crawford and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, attended a meeting in Virginia last night at which bad planning and the failure to demonstrate joined-up thinking were discussed.  One such example was of a primary school whose services had become quite inadequate.  Planners had been happy to grant permissions, builders to build and people to move into the neighbourhood but the education of children had not been catered for.  The speakers also decried departments being separated from each other.</P>
        <P>We need people to come together and be responsible for their own planning issues.  The people of Bailieborough should have been brought into the loop by councillors, or by us in this House, and told about the planning process, the implications of planning permission to build houses and the greater importance of schools in that equation.</P>
        <P>In many cities across the United States, business improvement districts have brought new economic opportunities and revitalisation stra<Col N="708"/>tegies to run-down areas.  Central government cannot achieve that so people must accept some responsibility for their own area and take a degree of ownership.  In another example in Monaghan, the Mullaghmatt housing estate was built some time ago.  The council then let the houses to people but did not properly maintain them.  Now people are trying to take ownership of the scheme.  They should get some Government assistance as they are meeting with many objections and not being adequately supported.  I ask the Minister to give ownership to these people because, in the long term, the Government will receive a greater dividend by supporting and encouraging such local developments and it would involve a relatively small amount of money.</P>
        <P>Business improvement districts provide an opportunity for co-operation, not only between the public and private sectors but also with planners, by bringing together various interest groups who share common goals.  There are many diverse interest groups and the idea of business improvement districts offers the opportunity to pull people together.</P>
        <P>In the coming century initiating and fostering these partnerships among community groups may be one of the most important roles of urban planners.  Urban planners must start to think outside the box and include people. The people on the housing scheme to which I referred do not believe that they are in the loop.  There are similar schemes in Muirhevnamore etc.  It is a matter of pulling people in and giving them a voice, be it unofficial or whatever.  They may not need to be elected representatives of the public, but while they do not necessarily go forward for public election, they are the voice of the people.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  People interested in developing areas should note that this innovative concept has been used internationally and I welcome the idea behind the scheme.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I approach this matter with a degree of cynicism.  While I like to be positive and proactive in everything I say and do, I have seen wonderful projects across Europe that were co-financed by local authorities.  As someone who has been involved in community projects, I am upset and annoyed by the lack of support provided by local authorities to communities interested in positive projects.  If one comprises a for-profit business, one has every opportunity to get money and to use it to good effect, but it is more difficult for community concerns.  Previous schemes required local community contributions, but getting that money can cost an arm and a leg and such projects may not get off the ground.</P>
        <P>I welcome the positive idea of a business improvement districts scheme, but enterprise schemes are only as good as the investment made <Col N="709"/>and the willingness of the local authority to carry them through.  In my area, the local authority has been incapable of handling waste management.  People have been given notice of ten business days, excluding holidays, to try to get an alternative disposal system for our county.  One would be inclined to succumb to the cynicism stemming from such issues, but one likes to be positive concerning these matters.</P>
        <P>The town of Ballina is a neglected area and has lost thousands of jobs without replacements.  It does not have an IDA Ireland site to which industrialists can locate.  We have been told that industrialists have been brought by IDA Ireland, but we do not know where because no industrial site exists.  There is a legal problem in respect of land acquired a number of years ago, but any local or State authority interested in the type of development that would bring necessary jobs to the area should ensure that the matter of land is not held up in a legal quagmire for years.</P>
        <P>We lack the resources to build the infrastructure necessary to make our area competitive, namely, broadband, roads and railways.  We must wait until 2008 before the BMW region is brought up to a par with the east and the south.  By 2008, the deficit of &euro;500 million in respect of our roads will have been made up, but where will the south and east be?  They will have gone so far ahead that the BMW region will not have caught up.  We will continue to lose 60% of graduates to the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Such problems exist, but I welcome the business improvement districts scheme and any measure that allows local autonomy in collecting funding for local use.  It is my earnest wish that schemes such as this succeed.  I will be positive concerning the matter and I hope that the Government will live up to its obligations to balance the deficit, which should have been made up by the end of this month, by 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  While I may not be as positive as some of my colleagues, it is not for reason of being awkward.  I come from the Border region where rates, insurance and so on have been major headaches.  I am slow to agree to more levies that may push businesses further into difficulty.  I realise that benefits will accrue from the BID scheme, but we must be careful.  During a D&aacute;il term when business broke down several times, it is unfortunate to rush this Bill through with little time to debate the nitty-gritty of the scheme.</P>
        <P>To start with the end of the Minister&rsquo;s speech rather than the beginning, one statement was particularly interesting.  Often, I have heard the Minister make statements that sound great.  He stated: &ldquo;All investment made through BIDs will be additional and complementary to the current level of services provided by the local authority.&rdquo; <Col N="710"/> I welcome the various funding provided to the Border region, such as the IFI funding resulting from the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the peace and reconciliation funding resulting from the Good Friday Agreement and the INTERREG III funding.</P>
        <P>The assurance given in respect of all the funding programmes was that, beyond a certain point, they would comprise additional funding based on the fact that areas had suffered dramatically due to the Troubles.  I went to school in Clones, and every road around it was closed down.  I will speak on valuations later, but the rates and insurance costs paid by businesses, such as hotels and filling stations, despite their economic difficulties, led to their closing.</P>
        <P>INTERREG, peace and reconciliation and IFI funding were introduced as additional funding to ensure that businesses would get extra money to guarantee them a step up.  Thank God for the funding.  It was needed, but it certainly was not additional, and I am not the only person who has said so.  The Taoiseach, who sat where the Minister is seated, admitted it to me across the floor of the House.  Anyone who examines the figures knows that is the case.  If the Bill is to be meaningful, it is important that the funding is additional and that, in one or two years, we do not find that it has become a replacement.</P>
        <P>As the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland support the scheme, it has the backing of business people and industry.  My colleague, Deputy Connolly, mentioned Mullaghmatt.  While it is a housing estate, it differs from those for which this scheme is intended.  However, I cannot help but support my colleague&rsquo;s cry for Mullaghmatt to be examined.  While a great deal of money is being provided, it is a matter of keeping the scheme moving and ensuring the community&rsquo;s involvement.  The community is prepared to get involved to ensure that the scheme works properly and that support is given for the work on the houses and walls.  There could be community employment scheme involvement if the groups concerned worked together.</P>
        <P>Money was allocated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to build a back road behind Dublin Street in Monaghan to allow major development.  There was, however, no mechanism to bring people together so it did not happen and the money was used for a road in Mullaghmatt.  I see benefits in this legislation so I want to tease it out to see how it might work.  That money was allocated and certain people in the area were enthusiastic but unfortunately it did not work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Towns such as Ballybay, Clones and Castleblayney have been on their knees.  Many businesses are not being utilised and many for sale signs are visible.  The problem is that the moment someone tries to get reconstruction off the ground, some person arrives from the Valuation <Col N="711"/>authority in Dublin.  Immediately a high rate is placed on the property.  I wrote to the Minister some time ago and received in reply a two page letter dictated by some of his Civil Service colleagues.</P>

	<P>I appreciate that, not all Ministers do it.  It does not, however, address the problem that there must be some leeway to allow those people to get off the ground.</P>
        <P>There is a business in south Monaghan in a factory that was closed for many years.  It is now a cement works, a completely different enterprise from the towel factory it once was.  It has been compared to all sorts of other businesses for rates.  This company decided to utilise the steel work to ensure its workers were covered while making the cement where many of its competitors work in the open air.  The company was given a valuation of &euro;1,196 or a rate bill of &euro;63,000 for 30 workers.  There must be a degree of fairness in the system, and this is completely over the top.  I talked to a number of people in the business and they say this is madness because the company will have to shed jobs to find the means to pay the bill if it is to continue in business.  It is a miracle the factory has reopened.  CPD in Clones was a major ratepayer and it is lying empty.</P>
        <P>We must be sympathetic towards small businesses that are trying to get off the ground and ensure they are not forced out of business.  I welcome the ideas in the Bill but small businesses need help to get off the ground and extra levies are not the answer.</P>

	<P>I regret the Deputy takes that point of view but I will not return it in kind.</P>
        <P>Deputy Crawford said he was worried about this being imposed but it will not be.  We are introducing facilitative legislation which will allow businesses in a particular area to come together for a specific purpose.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, until his last few moments in a very constructive contribution, was concerned about the majority and he made the point that the British have a double system.  The opposite effect would arise here, however, because it would give a disproportionate representation to the views of large business and it is important that there is equality in the system.</P>
        <P>Deputies O&rsquo;Dowd, Gilmore and Crawford mentioned additionality.  The idea is that it is protected by the benchmarking arrangements that exist specifically for that purpose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of Deputies mentioned the rating holiday that is being ended.  I was surprised this was raised so frequently because it is an injection of equity for all the other ratepayers; a holiday must be paid for and it is not fair if it is paid for by other ratepayers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies asked about the additionality and how to protect against it.  The BID company will have specific requirements that will then be costed and allocated.  Nothing other than those things the company requires to be brought on board will be brought into it.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe, who characteristically made a contribution and then left the House having asked a series of questions, made the point about local government being sufficiently funded.  I <Col N="713"/>draw attention to the allocation yesterday of &euro;958 million to local authorities through the general purposes grant.  Last year we allocated almost &euro;600 million for non-national roads and the figure will be higher this year.  This funding is almost three times what it was when other parties were in power in 1997.</P>

	<P>I make that point because it is becoming jaded for us to argue continuously that local authorities do not have money.  The major issue now is that local authorities have taxpayers&rsquo; money, &euro;9,000 million in one way or another in the coming year.  That is a huge amount and explains why I have introduced the amendments on the audit committees.  Deputy Gilmore was partly correct, the committees have not worked.  I agree that local authority members find it challenging to deal with the funds that come forward.  Local authority accounts are impenetrable and when talking about the expenditure local authorities are dealing with, it is important we strengthen the audit process.  We do not get value for money for every penny spent in all parts of public administration but I would be hard to persuade that we get 100% value for money in local government.</P>
        <P>In amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 11 we see a different form of audit committee with external membership to provide an alternative view and assess and promote efficiency, review the financial and budgetary reporting relationship, foster the development of best practice, review the auditor&rsquo;s report, review risk management and make other recommendations to the members of the local authority.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I will bring forward specific regulations to deal with audit committees, the holding of meetings and so on.  Regardless of whether they should comprise five or seven members, they should be small.  It is important that significant additional expertise is injected into local government because it is no longer a Cinderella service starved of funds; it handles a vast amount.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to Members who contributed.  The reason for the speedy passage of the legislation is the proposal has been around since 2001.  It is a good proposal and business interests are anxious to get on with the process, as Deputy Crawford mentioned.  We are enabling a new partnership between local government and businesses from which everybody will benefit.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann,</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />concerned at the serious traffic problems facing the Greater Dublin Area and the inadequacy of the current public transport system;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />conscious that even if the metro and rail proposals contained in Transport 21 are delivered on time, it will be many years before these services become available to the public; and</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />believing that in those circumstances the Dublin bus service will remain the principal provider of public transport in the city and surrounding areas for many years to come;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">calls on the Government to ensure relief for hard pressed commuters by:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the expansion of the Dublin Bus fleet by 50% (500 buses);</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the introduction of a flat fare of &euro;1 for adults and 50 cent for children;</P>

        <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Deputy Burton.</P>
        <P>Dublin traffic is on a knife-edge and recent experience has borne that out all too clearly.  With average speeds of 10 mph, we live in a city that grinds to a halt when it rains and cannot handle even minor road works and road traffic collisions without serious congestion.  Average peak time bus speeds have reduced to 8 mph.  Even on some quality bus corridors, QBCs, the average peak-time speed can be as low as 6 mph, and as low as 3 mph at pinch points.  With a popu<Col N="715"/>lation increase of 250,000 in the greater Dublin area, GDA, over the past ten years, half of it in the counties bordering Dublin, more commuters are travelling ever longer distances to work.  As a result, journey times have become unbearably long.  According to the latest available journey time figures, from Finglas to the city centre, it takes 54 minutes; from Howth, 56 minutes; from Malahide, 61 minutes; from Donabate, 63 minutes, from Stepaside village, 64 minutes; from Dunshaughlin, 75 minutes; from Loughlinstown roundabout, 76 minutes; from Kill 86 minutes; and from Saggart village, 99 minutes.  Many thousands of commuters, whether in private or public transport, spend more than three hours per day on the road on a good day.  If they were unlucky enough to be caught on the M50 during one of its recent monster tailbacks, they spent up to seven hours in a car.  That is the scale of the problem facing commuters in the GDA and, by any standard, it is a crisis.</P>
        <P>The fundamental problem is our utterly inadequate public transport system.  Dublin remains a heavily car dependent city.  Annual traffic surveys show that cars represent more than 80% of the traffic crossing the canals into Dublin city centre, whereas buses represent only 2% of that total.  At the time of the 2002 census, more than 60% of us travelled to work in the GDA by car, lorry or van.  The latest Dublin Transportation Office survey figures indicate this trend is continuing.  That figure is more than 70% for the three counties in the mid-east region.  We are counting the cost of all this congestion in our pockets and in our lives.  First and foremost, there is the incalculable cost to people&rsquo;s lives in the loss of significant family and leisure time, increased stress levels, reduced job and social opportunities and the ongoing degradation of the environment.  Business groups suggest the annual cost of congestion could be in excess of &euro;2 billion, while it is estimated congestion costs Dublin Bus &euro;60 million annually.</P>
        <P>The Government response to this crisis has been bewildering.  Incredibly, despite all the congestion, the Government has spectacularly failed to meet the demand for public transport services.  Its belated strategy is the &euro;34 billion Transport 21 plan.  It remains to be seen the extent to which this plan will ever be implemented, given the complete failure to deliver on the earlier Platform for Change plan.  The public transport element of Transport 21 essentially represents a long-term plan to expand rail services in the capital, little of which will come on stream within the next five to ten years.  However, the Government has no short to medium-term strategy to deal with the congestion crisis facing commuters now.  Dublin commuters cannot wait for Transport 21.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="716"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not have to be like this.  Congestion is not a problem of prosperity but of poor Government.  The Government has deliberately starved Dublin commuters of additional buses, with no increase in the Dublin Bus fleet between 2001 and late 2005. Transport 21 only delivered 17 new buses in 2005 and 15 this year and, in both cases, the buses were not operational until November or December.  QBCs without adequate bus services and bus services without adequate QBCs remain a problem.</P>
        <P>The only short to medium-term solution to the traffic chaos in the GDA is to provide commuters with the option of reliable public transport through improved bus services.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to bus services has been lethargic and incompetent.  No serious attempt has been made to develop them to the point to where they are seen by the public generally as a realistic, reliable or attractive alternative to the private car.  There are lessons to be learned from the experience with Luas.  When commuters are given the option of a transport system which they can depend on, which is fast and which ensures reliable journey times, they will make the switch.  Many of the characteristics of Luas can be replicated across the GDA if a strategic approach is adopted to bus services.  There is an urgent need to vastly expand bus capacity, speed up journey times and make bus travel financially attractive.  Only then will significant numbers of people leave their cars at home.</P>
        <P>The first part of this motion calls for the addition of 500 buses to the Dublin fleet.  At a time of great demand for public transport, Dublin has been starved of buses.  Under the current national development plan, NDP, the Government promised to provide Dublin Bus with 275 additional buses by the end of 2006.  This promise was never kept and, astonishingly, at a D&aacute;il committee last week the Minister suggested that the buses were not provided because they were not needed.  How far removed are the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, from reality?  It is hard to believe the Minister has any understanding of his area of responsibility or has any regard for the thousands of commuters stuck in traffic on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>Incredibly, in spite of population growth and increased numbers in employment between 2001 and late 2005, the Government refused to increase the size of the Dublin Bus fleet of 1,062.  Late last year, there was a minor increase and the same occurred this year and we are told the figure will rise to 1,182 by the end of next year.</P>
        <P>There is a vague Government promise to provide a further 100 buses from the private sector and this is supposed to be overseen by a Dublin transport authority that we have yet to see.  Not only will this not meet demand, the issue is when, if ever, we will see these promised buses.  The Dublin transport authority has yet to be <Col N="717"/>established, does not even have an interim chief executive officer and no Bill for its establishment has yet been published by the Minister for Transport, let alone passed by the D&aacute;il.  In addition, reform of bus licensing law which dates back to 1932 is required, although legislation is not expected to be available until the end of 2007 at the earliest.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s proposals are hopelessly inadequate.  In its network review of 2005, Dublin Bus set out the need for an extra 425 buses, primarily to service areas of expanding population and to increase bus frequency along quality bus corridor, QBC, routes such as Tallaght, Rathfarnham, south Clondalkin, Malahide, Blanchardstown and Lucan, all of which badly need more buses.  It is inexcusable that the Government continues to deny commuters decent public transport and it is particularly frustrating for commuters to see bus lanes without buses.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party accepts the figure of 425 extra buses that Dublin Bus proposes, but we also want to extend expressway and limited stop services from outside the M50 and from park and ride sites.  We want to expand orbital and feeder services and we want more local services for centres of population, work and commerce.  To do this, Dublin Bus would require 500 additional buses in its fleet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The second part of this motion calls for the completion of quality bus corridors.  At 13 km/h, the average speed of Dublin buses is almost the slowest in Europe and, apart from Paris, no other capital city has a slower peak time bus speed.  Our average speed compares to Reykjavik at 28 km/h, Helsinki at 27 km/h, London and Prague at 26 km/h, Rotterdam at 23 km/h and Venice at 22 km/h.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party wants to put the quality back into quality bus corridors.  QBCs have contributed enormously to Dublin&rsquo;s transport system.  A 50% increase in bus passenger numbers on these routes in the past nine years shows that they are popular with commuters and they can work.  However, QBCs have the potential to be much more effective in terms of shorter journey times and achieving much greater efficiency from the bus fleet.  To do this, we want the following steps taken.</P>
        <P>We want to see the existing bus corridors completed.  In six of the current 13 QBCs less than half the route is actually a bus lane and, overall, only 52% of the road space on QBC routes comprises bus lane.  The Howth Road, Tallaght, Rathfarnham and north Clondalkin QBCs all have bus lanes on less than 40% of their length.  There are particular shortages on outbound routes with only four of the existing QBCs having <Col N="718"/>bus lanes on half or more of their routes.  Overall, only 42% of outbound QBC kilometres are actually covered by bus lane.</P>
        <P>It is this lack of bus priority that impacts drastically on bus journey times and operating costs.  It makes buses an unattractive alternative for motorists because of the uncertainty relating to journey times and, in many cases, the minimal time advantage of travelling by bus.  It also makes the system unmanageable for bus operators.</P>
        <P>Bus speeds on part of the Swords QBC where bus priority is not in place can be as low as 4 km/h.  Some Blanchardstown services now have journey times lasting up to a gruelling 130 minutes.  A Labour Party survey in March 2006 of the Granby Row and Dorset Street junction at peak time showed that outbound buses were waiting an average of 22 minutes, and up to 31 minutes in some cases, to travel around a block, a distance of one eighth of a mile.  That junction is critical and serves most buses on the north side of Dublin.  More QBCs must be commissioned on the main arteries and we need to give much greater priority to buses at junctions.  In addition, we need the early introduction of real-time information at bus stops.  Certainty of journey time is an important factor in the minds of commuters as it allows people to plan a journey.  People need to know a bus will be along in five or ten minutes time when they arrive at a bus stop rather than standing waiting for 25 to 30 minutes not knowing if a bus will ever come as is the case at present.</P>
        <P>The third part of this Labour Party motion deals with fares.  There is a need to totally revamp fare structures because, at present, fares are too high, too cumbersome and add to delays.  There are strong arguments, on grounds of convenience, for a flat rate &euro;1 fare.  If one examines the current Dublin Bus fare structure, the lowest adult fare of 95 cent takes at the very least four coins, the &euro;1.35 fare takes at least four coins, the &euro;1.55 fare takes three coins and so on up the scale.  This change relates to convenience, but the Labour Party believes there is a strong argument for a flat &euro;1 fare to provide a financial incentive to convince commuters to switch from private to public transport.  Later I will discuss how the cost of such a simplified low fare system can be recouped tenfold.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is calling for the introduction of a standard &euro;1 per trip fare across the entire Dublin Bus network, similar to the London model, and on all public bus services within 25 miles of the city centre.  Outside this zone, fares should be tapered according to distance, ensuring simplicity and fairness in the fare structure.</P>
        <P>We want to place particular emphasis on child fares by providing a standard 50 cent fare and extending eligibility to all children under 18 years of age.  This is critical as the school run adds considerably to morning congestion and it is important to encourage the use of public trans<Col N="719"/>port from an early age.  In addition, there is no logic to the current system which dictates that 16 and 17-year-olds pay adult fares.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party also wants to make tickets more accessible by ensuring that on-street ticket machines for buses, similar to Luas, are available to the public at key city centre bus stops, suburban stopping points and, if necessary, on buses themselves.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Labour Party wants to extend the Dublin Bus network and the &euro;1 fare zone to major residential areas within a radius of at least 25 miles of the city centre, including towns and villages like Ashbourne, Dunshaughlin, Clane, Kill, Naas, Prosperous, Ratoath, Sallins, and Straffan.  We want to reduce fares on a scale related to distance beyond this zone, which will result in a more affordable and simplified fare structure throughout the region.  While Bus &Eacute;ireann may continue to operate the service, it will become the overall responsibility of Dublin Bus and the latter&rsquo;s fare structures will apply.  This will address a serious anomaly in fare structures, whereby a commuter can pay 127% more on a one way adult fare and 58% more on the equivalent of a weekly ticket over comparable distances.  It will also end the public bus rip-off of areas of south County Meath, about which I have received a number of representations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Finally, this motion calls for the early commissioning of park and ride facilities.  The logic of bus-based park and ride has been discussed for many years but no action has been taken.  As a result, there is no permanent bus-based park and ride facility in the greater Dublin area.  In 2004, the Department of Transport paid a paltry &euro;800,000 to local authorities for park and ride facilities in the greater Dublin area and, in 2005, the even smaller sum of &euro;289,000.  It is not as if there has been a massive expansion of rail based park and ride.  Transport 21 provides for at least six park and ride sites around the M50 in conjunction with planned rail improvements.  Metro north is due to have two park and ride sites providing parking for over 2,000 cars at Lissenhall, north of Swords, and at Metro Park, north of Ballymun.  In the past two weeks, a planning application was made to Fingal County Council for a separate 1,386 park and ride site beside the NCT centre to serve Dublin Airport.  If there is a need to facilitate parking at the airport, the need must be all the greater to serve commuters to the city centre.  The Luas extension from Sandyford to Cherrywood will have a park and ride site at Carrickmines providing 300 spaces.  Why not provide those spaces now?  There are also park and ride facilities planned for the junction of the N11 and the Luas extension from Cherrywood to the Bray area and the junctions of Metro West and the N2, N3 and N4.  Again, why wait for a project that will take more than ten years to com<Col N="720"/>plete?  A serious need exists for park and ride facilities in order to relieve the city&rsquo;s chronic congestion problems and the sites have been identified, so why not provide the facilities now?  If these are real proposals and not just stunts, there is no excuse for not proceeding with them.  Once in Government, the Labour Party will establish these park and ride sites immediately and will service them with express bus services to the city centre.  We will also develop additional park and ride sites on approaches to the city as identified by the local authorities.  The proposals being made by the Labour Party on bus services are achievable, cost effective, deliverable in a matter of months and represent the only viable alternative to the daily car commute endured by many thousands of people.</P>
        <P>Of course, there are further issues to address in terms of congestion.  In particular, urgent action is needed on the West Link toll bridge.  Next Wednesday, the Dublin Port tunnel will open, spilling thousands of trucks on to an already congested M50.  The West Link is a major congestion point on the M50 and for traffic in general in the greater Dublin area.  A minimum of 2,500 additional trucks will use the West Link on a daily basis, the equivalent of 6,500 cars in terms of road space, making an already congested road impossible to travel during the day.</P>
        <P>It is not as if this situation has arisen overnight.  The Government has known for the past ten years that the port tunnel would open and that these additional trucks would spill on to the M50, yet it has done nothing to prepare for it.  It could have put in place a system to allow for barrier-free tolling or, in the context of its negotiations with NTR, taken early control of the toll bridge to ensure it will be in a position to manage the chaotic situations which are likely to arise once the port tunnel opens.  It could have managed the situation by lifting the toll barriers whenever congestion and tailbacks became unbearable or by varying tolls to allow for greater use of the West Link and the M50 during non-peak hours.  Incentives such as free tolls could have been offered at certain times of the day.  However, the Government has no scope to take such actions because the best it can offer is that something will happen in two years time.  Given the record it has set in terms of missing deadlines and targets, there is no reason to hope that matters will ever improve.  There is no excuse for the lack of preparation for the opening of the port tunnel.  The Government has utterly failed to develop a system which would have improved conditions at the West Link.  Further measures should be introduced to ensure the city&rsquo;s traffic moves reasonably freely, such as more policing or a year-round version of Operation Freeflow.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that the costs of my party&rsquo;s proposals are put in their proper context.  The chamber of commerce has estimated that conges<Col N="721"/>tion costs the business community some &euro;2 billion annually.  Dublin Bus estimates the costs it faces in terms of congestion at &euro;60 million annually, a figure which entirely consumes the subvention provided to the company, while Bus &Eacute;ireann estimates its congestion costs at &euro;35 million annually.  Dublin, at 26%, has the lowest subvention rate for bus services out of 16 European cities.  It compares terribly with, for example, Athens at 62%, Brussels at 67% and Luxembourg at 78%.  The principal expenses in Labour&rsquo;s plan will be 500 buses at a mere &euro;300,000 each, or &euro;15 million on an annualised basis and &euro;50 million to complete the quality bus corridors.  The estimated loss to Dublin Bus arising from the proposed &euro;1 incentive would be approximately &euro;25 million.  We have to bear in mind that it is estimated that the additional income from the increased numbers of passengers would be &euro;17.5 million.  Given that thousands of commuters are spending more than three hours on the road each day, it is clear that considerable social and economic savings can be made by shortening journey times.  The Labour Party estimates that the number of bus passengers who travel during the morning peak period can be increased from the current 115,000 to 180,000.  If these plans can save people an average of just 15 minutes on their journey times, it is possible to quantify the financial savings in terms of time saved.  Over &euro;1 million will be saved each day &mdash; &euro;250 million will be saved per annum &mdash; if 180,000 commuters save a total of 30 minutes each every day.  That estimate is based on average wage costs of a conservative &euro;12 per hour.  In addition, those who have to continue to use their cars would enjoy time savings worth an estimated &euro;60 million per annum.  It is clear that the cost benefit of the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal would be quite substantial, in terms of economic, social and personal costs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, needs to show some leadership, vision and political will to solve the problem.  None of those characteristics is evident from him tonight, sadly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Shortall, on proposing this motion, which outlines a most imaginative plan for tackling the short-term difficulties which are causing gridlock in Dublin.</P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach opened the National Aquatic Centre in west Dublin a couple of years ago, he famously declared to gasps from the locals who were present in the audience that it was great that Blanchardstown was just 20 minutes away from the GPO.  He can dream on.  It might take one just 20 minutes to make such journey if one has a State car and a Garda driver who is legally allowed to use the bus lanes.  The average bus journey time from Dublin 15 to the city centre for the ordinary commuter is 111 minutes.  When the M50 clogs up, as happened <Col N="722"/>last week, it can take three hours to make an eight-mile journey.  It took longer to get from Blanchardstown or Lucan to the city centre last week than it would have taken to travel by train from Dublin to Belfast.  That is what we are talking about.  I expect that new novels, films and other works of art or rage will start to emerge some day soon when people outline the details of their experience of commuting from places like Blanchardstown in the west of Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Government, which has encouraged the construction of tens of thousands of homes in west Dublin and similar areas in Dublin and other cities, is indifferent to the plight of people who use public transport.  A significant number of people, particularly young people, who are moving into new homes in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford would love to be able to use public transport &mdash; buses or trains &mdash; but they cannot do so.  Such services are either not available or, in the case of bus services in particular, are not available reliably.  If extra buses were made available immediately, I do not doubt that up to 20% of car users who currently make direct journeys in and out of cities like Dublin would transfer to public transport services like buses and trains.</P>
        <P>It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a European capital city that has traffic congestion that is as bad and public transport that is as poor as Dublin and other Irish cities.  Deputy Shortall cited some statistics in that regard.  We know how fast the economy is growing, although it seems to come as a surprise to the Government.  We know where houses, factories and offices are being built.  The provision of appropriate transport infrastructure at an early stage is standard government practice in the rest of Europe, but not in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is incapable of making the right decisions about transport, or of making such decisions in a timely fashion.  Traffic levels on the M50 reached that motorway&rsquo;s design capacity some years ago.  It was obvious for the previous two or three years that it was about to happen.  The decision to widen the M50 and to improve the junctions leading to it should have been taken in the late 1990s, rather than last year.  We will have to endure roadworks for the next four years on an orbital city motorway that jams up every morning and afternoon because it is carrying traffic at almost twice its design capacity.  The same thing can be said about the toll barriers on the West Link bridge.  It famously took the Taoiseach and his Ministers three years to make a decision on the new terminal at Dublin Airport.  However, the Government is able to make decisions on tax breaks for the property developers who fund Fianna F&aacute;il in a matter of days.</P><Col N="723"/>
        <P>New towns have been developing since the 1960s in the greater Dublin area, in places like Blanchardstown, Lucan, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Swords.  It is pretty obvious that high capacity rapid rail and bus links to the centre of Dublin are needed in such towns, many of which have populations in excess of that of Limerick city.  Good local transport links between the outlying areas and centres of such towns are also needed.  No such facilities are available at present.  People have to walk up to two miles to town centres, or are forced to buy two cars for each household.  The level of traffic congestion in the areas I have mentioned is notorious.  It takes at least an hour and a half to travel into the centre of Dublin from the outlying areas of these new towns by car or by bus in the mornings and evenings.  Working in the city centre can involve a three-hour commute for people who want to see their children, particularly their young children, before they are fast asleep in bed.</P>
        <P>The cost to business of the transport difficulties I have mentioned is substantial.  The lifestyle of many young workers is being affected by these problems.  People who have children are unable to spend as much quality time as they would like with their families.  The Minister for Education and Science famously said last Easter that parents should spend more quality time with their children.  She gave us all a lecture about the matter, as if parents were unaware of it.  I hope she will have a word in the ear of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher.  As a member of the Government, the best thing the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, could do to improve the ability of parents to spend quality time with their children would be to help to reduce the exceptional amount of time that parents have to spend commuting.  The citizens of no other city in Europe have to endure such time consuming journeys for such relatively short distances.  It is totally unprecedented in this country for an eight-mile journey to take three hours.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to recognise the scale of the transport crisis throughout Dublin.  Suburban towns are expanding rapidly without additional transport infrastructure being put in place.  Dublin is expanding not only into counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, but also into counties Carlow and Kilkenny.  It takes those who live in a small place like Paulstown, which is ten miles from Kilkenny city, a great deal of time to travel into that city.  Commuters from west Dublin are at their wits&rsquo; end because any minor crash or obstruction anywhere along the M50 is guaranteed to lead to a morning of hell for them, regardless of whether they take public transport or drive to work in their cars.  Local bus services, such as the 39 route, are supposed to be served by bus lanes or quality bus corridors, just like the 46 route, which passes RTE.  The bus corridor in that <Col N="724"/>part of west Dublin is a fantasy, in practice, because buses use dedicated bus lanes for just 22% of their journeys.  The crisis in journey times cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>A commuter recently sent me a letter about commuting from Clonsilla.  The letter states that the train arrives seriously overcrowded with approximately three carriages &mdash; half a train.  He is then faced with pushing, shoving and, on occasion, people fainting beside him.  He states that he could not face this journey daily because of the claustrophobic conditions.  Unfortunately, he would rather face a one hour 30 minute plus journey on the bus than travel on a train for 25 minutes.  He states that in the evening he has to rely on a lift from the train station which allows him to get home at a reasonable time to ensure some kind of life.  He further states that the option of affording a house on a train line is not possible due to the extortionate price of houses beside decent transport services.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shortall listed the imaginative and simple steps the Labour Party would take.  Transport is key to our competitiveness and to the quality of life of our young, well-educated people whom we hope will stay in this country.  We do not want them to emigrate to London where they will be able to afford a house and get a decent commuter service that allows them have some quality of family life.  Transport is essential for business.</P>
        <P>I noted with concern the famous ambiguity of the Taoiseach this week as he hinted that the lorries may not be taken off the streets of Dublin when the port tunnel is open.  The Taoiseach is famous for being like Janus &mdash; facing in every direction.  Having spent all that money, if there is not a total quality bus corridor all along the north and south side of the quays, the Taoiseach, who represents the constituency that covers most of central Dublin, ought to resign before the people show him the door.</P>

        <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O&rsquo;Connor.  I am disappointed but not surprised by the terms of the motion. The Labour Party seems to be of the view that proposals such as a &euro;1 fare represent the best way forward in terms of building an integrated approach to meeting the transport needs of the greater Dublin area.  The headline-catching &euro;1 fare proposed is uncosted and it is not clear whether it would apply to some or all services in the Dublin metropolitan area.  The motion is evidence, if that was needed, of the weak foundations on which the Labour Party&rsquo;s policy for public transport in Dublin is based.</P>
        <P>The Government has a very proud track record of delivery.  Since 2000 we have invested almost &euro;3.5 billion in public transport, unprecedented in our history; more people are switching to public transport as we expand capacity; and major projects have been delivered, more are almost ready for delivery and more are at planning stage.</P>
        <P>Traffic has grown nationally and in the Dublin area in line with the population and the growth in employment and the economy.  The success of our economy has created new and more complex mobility and accessibility needs.  This is demonstrated by comparing the total number of motor <Col N="726"/>vehicles registered in the country in 2000 to 2005, which shows an increase of 27% to some 2.1 million vehicles.  Average daily traffic flows on the M50 adjacent to the N4 junction increased by over 11% between November 2003 and November 2005, while traffic on the M4 increased by almost 9% in the same period.  That level of traffic growth clearly reflects population and employment growth on the back of a thriving economy.</P>
        <P>The Government has responded to these needs and is continuing to do so.  There has been major investment in transport in the greater Dublin area since 1997.  I wish to take this opportunity to put some of the benefits and achievements of this investment on the record of the House.</P>
        <P>On the bus service, the Dublin Bus fleet and its capacity have been significantly increased.  In 1997, it stood at just over 900 buses.  By the end of January next it will have increased to approximately 1,182, taking into account the 100 additional buses currently being purchased by Dublin Bus.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has also deployed additional buses in commuter services to the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>As well as those additional buses, there has also been significant bus replacement.  Over the period since 1997, and including the 100 additional buses currently being delivered, Dublin Bus will have purchased a total of 1,095 new buses of which over 280 are additional, which is in line with our NDP commitments.</P>
        <P>In terms of capacity, both seated and standing, I understand the capacity of the Dublin Bus fleet at the end of 2005 was, at over 98,000 passenger spaces, 30% greater than in 1999 due to the purchase of additional buses and the replacement of smaller buses by double deckers.</P>
        <P>This increase in the fleet of Dublin Bus has been reflected in the increased subvention paid to Dublin Bus.  The annual subvention paid has increased from &euro;8.8 million in 1997 to almost &euro;70 million in 2006.  Over that period almost &euro;440 million has been paid in subvention to Dublin Bus towards the cost of loss-making services.</P>
        <P>The increased bus fleet and bus capacity has benefited from major investment in quality bus corridors and traffic management systems.  Since 2001, a total of over &euro;130 million has been allocated to bus priority measures.  As a result, the current length of quality bus corridors in the greater Dublin area comes to 139 km, of which 72.3 km comprises inbound bus lanes and 52.5 km comprises outbound lanes.  There are also a further 20 km of non-QBC corridors with bus priority measures.</P>
        <P>Eleven QBCs are now in operation in the greater Dublin area.  They are south Clondalkin, Swords Road, Blanchardstown, Tallaght via Rathgar, Rathfarnham, north Clondalkin, Finglas, Stillorgan Road, which includes an exten<Col N="727"/>sion to Bray, Malahide Road, Lucan Road and the western orbital.</P>
        <P>In January of this year, the Dublin Transportation Office reviewed the bus priority programme in the context of the goal set in Transport 21.  As a result, extra capacity will be delivered by the end of 2007 by projects that are currently under construction.  These include the Blackrock QBC, Snugborough Road, Kilmacud QBC, South Clondalkin QBC &mdash; phase 3, Pearse Street bus priority scheme &mdash; phase 2, Dunshaughlin, Bracetown, Earlsfort Terrace-St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, Naas Road QBC &mdash; phases 2 and 3, and Waterloo Road bus priority scheme.  In addition, the tender process is under way for schemes at Santry Avenue and Coolock Lane-Oscar Traynor Road.</P>
        <P>As part of the overall effort to improve bus services, the Dublin Transportation Office undertakes an annual monitoring exercise of bus services.  This helps to pinpoint where bus priority measures are constrained by pinch points.  These are particular locations that need additional work to protect bus operations from the effects of traffic congestion.  The results of this monitoring is taken into account by the DTO in the bus priority scheme programme.  I understand that a significant portion of the quality bus network office&rsquo;s 2006 programme addresses urgent needs at such pinch points.</P>
        <P>The rail service has also been dramatically improved since 1997.  The DART fleet has been increased from 80 to 156 carriages and the DART upgrade project involving track renewal, upgrades of stations, etc, has been completed.  Peak hour capacity on the DART increased from approximately 14,000 to 27,000 when refurbishment of the original fleet was completed.</P>
        <P>The Maynooth line has been upgraded through the doubling of track between Maynooth and Clonsilla and 143 new diesel commuter railcars have been brought into service.  More than 90% of the 180 commuter railcars are new or less than ten years old.  Capacity increases of approximately 25% have been achieved on the Maynooth line, more than 40% on the Dundalk line and approximately 30% on the Gorey line.</P>
        <P>The completion of the Heuston Station redevelopment project including, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of four additional platforms and the upgrading of track and signalling has improved services.  The beneficial impact of this investment is reflected in the overall passenger numbers on the DART and suburban services, which have grown from 20 million in 1997 to approximately 25 million today.  In overall terms, numbers being carried on the Irish Rail suburban rail network are at an all time high.</P>
        <P>The completion of the two Luas lines has taken public transport services to a new level.  Luas has been an unprecedented success and is indicative <Col N="728"/>of what is to come in terms of the quality of public transport services to be developed under Transport 21.  Luas is providing high quality, high capacity and frequent services.  The existing Luas network is expected to carry in the region of 25 million passengers this year, an increase of more than 13% on last year&rsquo;s carryings, and the expanded Luas and metro networks provided for in Transport 21 are expected to add an additional 80 million passengers per annum when complete.</P>
        <P>The success of the Luas has already demonstrated that light rail is an essential and popular component of the public transport infrastructure for Dublin and augurs well for the continued success of the major expansion under Transport 21.  This will make an important contribution to achieving more sustainable transport solutions through reducing congestion on the road network.</P>
        <P>The investment I have outlined in public transport is only part of the picture.  Since 1997, the Government has driven the upgrade of the national roads network in the Dublin area with major upgrades completed on the M1, the N2 to Ashbourne, the N3, the N4 to Kinnegad and beyond, the N7 to Portlaoise, the N11 to Arklow and the completion, and now the upgrade of the earlier sections, of the M50.  The opening in the coming days of the Dublin Port tunnel will remove thousands of trucks from the city streets and will be another milestone in the upgrading of our roads infrastructure.</P>
        <P>All of these investments have helped tackle major traffic bottlenecks in the Dublin area and greater Dublin region and helped in coping with the vastly increased volume of traffic attributable to our economic, employment and population growth.  Progress has also been made by the director of traffic for Dublin in improving traffic management and control while the growth in the number of taxis has improved that service dramatically.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 will build on these achievements.  The Transport 21 strategy for the Dublin area includes the transformation of public transport in the greater Dublin area through a major expansion in rail based public transport infrastructure, a 60% increase in bus capacity and a doubling in size of the quality bus network.  Transport 21 recognises that the bus will continue to play a crucial role in Dublin&rsquo;s public transport system.  Accordingly, it provides for major investment of more than &euro;500 million in the bus service with a greater focus on the development of orbital, feeder and local services.  In addition to funding for the 100 additional buses, my Department has also approved funding of &euro;12 million towards the cost of replacement buses for Dublin Bus in 2007.  As announced by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, in September, it is intended to secure the next tranche of additional buses for Dublin from the private sector.</P><Col N="729"/>
        <P>Transport 21 also provides for major improvements in the suburban rail service through the Kildare line project, the opening of a new station in Docklands, the provision of rail services to Navan on a phased basis and improvements to city centre resignalling to increase the number of trains per hour through the city centre.  All these improvement works are progressing well with the Docklands Station due to open in four months&rsquo; time in April next and work due to get under way shortly on the Kildare project and the signalling project in 2007.</P>
        <P>The key to unlocking the full potential of the suburban railway network in the Dublin area is the interconnector and electrification project.  Irish Rail has commenced the planning of this project.  With the interconnector in place, a major expansion in services will be possible.  New DART services will be available on the Kildare line, to Drogheda on the northern line and to Maynooth.  On completion of the Transport 21 programme, the suburban rail systems will be able to carry an extra 80 million passengers per annum.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency is making good progress on the roll-out of the Luas and Metro projects provided for in Transport 21.  Projects for early delivery include the extension of the trams on the Luas red line, the Tallaght line, from 30 m to 40 m, which will provide an additional 40% capacity. The first 40 m trams will be delivered early in 2007 and all tram extensions will be completed in 2008.  Additional trams will be purchased to increase capacity on both Luas lines.  Subject to approval by my Department of the business case, an additional eight trams will be ordered early next year and will commence service early in 2009, providing an additional 15% capacity across the existing system.</P>
        <P>Subject to an enforceable railway order, the Docklands extension to the red Tallaght Luas line should be completed in 2009.  This extension will add an additional 2 million trips to the Luas network and remove over 1 million trips from the road network.  Subject to the provision of a railway order, the Citywest extension to the red Tallaght Luas line should be completed in 2010.  It will serve the residential and commercial centre of Citywest, including the National Digital Park.  The project will also serve the communities of west Tallaght, including Fettercairn and Cheeverstown.  Additional patronage is estimated at 3.5 million per annum.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Cullen, signed the railway order for the Luas extension to Cherrywood on 14 August 2006.  Additional patronage on this extension is expected to be 8 million passengers and over 5 million car trips will be removed from the roads.  In early October, a third party sought leave in the High Court to challenge the grant of this order by way of judicial review.  This matter is now before the courts.  The completion date for <Col N="730"/>this project is now dependent on the outcome of the High Court proceedings.</P>
        <P>Good progress is also being made on other major metro and Luas projects.  The RPA has completed a comprehensive public consultation process on four potential routes for metro north and the preferred route was announced on 19 October last.  Metro north will have 15 stops between St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and Lissenhall.  An estimated 34 million passengers a year will travel on this service, with trains every four minutes, increasing to 90 seconds as the demand builds.  The journey time from the city centre to Dublin Airport will be 17 minutes and the journey to Swords from the city centre will be 26 minutes.</P>
        <P>The RPA is on target to submit a railway order application in summer 2007.  The procurement phase will start shortly with the prequalification of consortia to finance, build and maintain the metro.  The Minister launched the public consultation process for metro west on 22 November last.  Some 50,000 newsletters will be circulated to households and other interested parties along the proposed routes as part of this consultation.  It is expected that a preferred alignment will be identified in 2007.  A feasibility study on route alignments for the Lucan Luas line is ongoing and public consultation on the further extension of the Luas from Cherrywood to Bray was launched on 14 August 2006.</P>
        <P>Under Transport 21, the quality bus network will be doubled over the ten-year period of the programme.  This will result in a more consistently reliable set of services than is possible with existing congestion levels.  QBCs will allow for more efficient use of buses resulting in enhanced levels of service.  Priority projects being targeted by the quality bus network project for an early start and for which funding has been provided include south Clondalkin QBC &mdash; phase three; Malahide super QBC upgrade; Howth Road; Blanchardstown Road north and south; Foxrock to D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Blanchardstown super QBC; north Clondalkin; Tallaght QBC; Lucan QBC enhancements; and city centre priority measures.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Transport 21 also provides for substantial investment in park and ride facilities.  As the Minister has made clear on previous occasions, we regard the provision of appropriate park and ride facilities as having an important role to play in persuading people to move from their cars to public transport.  This in turn will have obvious benefits for congestion relief, for the wider economy and for the environment.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>In 2005, a Dublin Transportation Office strategy for rail-based park and ride facilities was approved.  This envisages facilities at 22 locations on the existing and proposed rail network within the greater Dublin area.  These sites represent a combination of strategic and local sites.  The DTO strategy emphasises the importance of developing <Col N="731"/>park and ride facilities in line with expansion of the rail network, rather than ahead of it.  This is because there is no point in building park and ride facilities where the public transport network is not yet ready to absorb additional capacity.  Accordingly, additional park and ride facilities are being provided as part of rail improvements, such as the Kildare route project at Hazlehatch, Fonthill, Kishogue and Adamstown, as well as the metro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister ever heard of bus-based park and ride facilities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party is proposing in this motion that the problems of Dublin might be solved if we constructed a network of park and ride sites, fed by what it calls express buses.  Perhaps the Labour Party has not had time to do much homework on this topic, but I am only too happy to help.  Its members may be surprised to know that the DTO commissioned a study on bus-based park and ride facilities and their potential solution to traffic problems in Dublin, which was published in 2002 and is available on its website.  This study, conducted by the British firm TAS, looked at the suitability of bus-based park and ride facilities as a solution to congestion in Dublin.  The study explains the appropriate conditions in which bus-based park and ride solutions work on a large scale.  These include a maximum travel distance of 5 km from the park and ride facility to the urban centre, a maximum journey time of 15-20 minutes, and notably concluded that bus-based park and ride facilities are ideally suited to urban areas with a population of less than 200,000.</P>
        <P>This does not mean that there may not be specific bus-based park and ride projects on specific corridors which could be very successful.  The study noted that a role existed for small parking facilities close to bus stops in the outer regions, where access to bus services is poor because of the low density of the population and where existing bus services have capacity to take more passengers.  In this context, South Dublin County Council has indicated that it may seek funding for a pilot park and ride service and has selected two possible sites, one on the N4 and one on the N7 near the Citywest interchange.  We remain open to proposals for such projects.</P>
        <P>From the TAS study, it is clear the idea that strategic park and ride sites served by buses can be a magic bullet for the problems of congestion in Dublin is objectively not the case.  Certainly, bus-based park and ride facilities can play some role in solving Dublin&rsquo;s problems, but not a decisive role.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has park and ride facilities at the majority of the railway stations throughout its network, ranging from small on-street facilities to large pay facilities at major <Col N="732"/>stations.  All commuter parking at Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann stations is currently free, while D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown Council operates a pay car park at Salthill.  Connolly and Heuston Stations both have dedicated pay car parks for intercity users.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann plans to expand a number of these park and ride facilities next year.  There are currently four park and ride sites along the existing Luas network at Red Cow, Sandyford, Stillorgan and Balally.  The RPA proposes to open a new park and ride facility adjacent to the Tallaght Luas stop within the next two years, with an anticipated capacity of 450 spaces.</P>
        <P>It is clear that we have made substantial progress in addressing the weaknesses in our transport infrastructure.  It is also clear that the fast pace of growth we have experienced is straining our infrastructure at peak times, and that this can be exacerbated to intolerable levels when accidents or incidents combine with poor weather to cause major delays and tailbacks.  The challenges we face are to manage our transport system better and to take measures in the short term to improve the system, while ensuring that the major projects necessary for a well functioning transport system in the medium and longer term are rapidly advanced.  The Government is dealing with these challenges.  It has committed the funding and it is taking action now, while at the same time keeping a clear focus on the integrated transport system necessary to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and growth.  The amendment to the motion sets out our commitment to providing Dublin with the transport system appropriate to its status as a thriving capital city and states our record of significant progress in pursuing this objective.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for allowing me to share his time.  I was going to make a national speech, but as the Minister of State has mentioned Tallaght several times, I should be allowed to mention Tallaght a few times.  Before Deputy Shortall heckles me, I compliment her on her initiative in this area.  It is good that she has given us an opportunity to air our different views.  I am sure different political points will be made and that is fair enough.  I have often praised Deputy Mitchell, but it suits Deputy McEntee to sit in the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s seat.</P>
        <P>This is an important debate and we all know the challenges for public transport.  I drive into work some days and I use the Luas other days.  There are difficulties and challenges involved.  Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country and the Luas has been a great success.  However, there are still public transport problems in the area.  The people of Tallaght are being let down by Dublin Bus.  New estates and communities have been established in Tallaght in the last few years, with many people coming from different parts of the city and elsewhere.  Many of <Col N="733"/>the estates in Ballycullen, Firhouse, Westbrook and so on have huge populations, yet Dublin Bus has decided not to cater for them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I will look at you in order not to attract any attention.  Dublin Bus should not be putting the blame on Luas.  Dublin Bus management has never stated that the company has not enough buses, but it is using the success of Luas as an excuse for not developing services in parts of my constituency.  As someone who does not have a marketing degree, I say that it does not take quantum physics to figure that out.  There are many opportunities for the development of public transport in the Tallaght region.  I will continue to make the point about my town and its surrounding communities.  Every day people from urban and even rural parts of my constituency raise public transport issues with me.</P>
        <P>In his fine address, the Minister of State outlined the Government&rsquo;s actions on public transport in the greater Dublin area.  Other colleagues are entitled to hold different views, but it is a fact that the Government has invested in public transport improvements since 2000.  The DART fleet has practically been doubled.  New eight-car peak services have been introduced, providing for 30% more passengers.  For the outer suburban lines, passenger-carrying capacity was increased on the northern line to Drogheda by 50%, on the south-east line to Arklow and Gorey by 30%, on the western line to Maynooth by 66%, and on the south-western line to Kildare by 130%.  Some 117 km of quality bus networks are in place in the greater Dublin area, including my own constituency.  Peak capacity has been increased on all main routes into Dublin, as the Minister of State said.  I recall various adverse comments made in this House and indeed, the media, about the Luas.  The Luas is a tremendous success on both lines.  It is used by many people coming and going to Tallaght.  Now that we know that the extension to Citywest is to take place, it is kind of the Minister of State to mention the various estates and it is good to open them up.  I have been pointing out to the RPA that stops must be included at Fettercairn, Brookfield and out towards the west. <Col N="734"/> It is important to take every opportunity to make that point.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 will entail enormous investment over the next ten years.  It will include in excess of &euro;13 billion being spent on transport, here in the greater Dublin area, and also in our major cities and on bus fleets countrywide.  We have all been pleased to see progress over the last 12 months, with the railway order for Cherrywood Luas being signed in August.  Public consultation of the extension of the Luas from Cherrywood to Bray also began in August.  The Minister for Transport will shortly decide on the railway order for the Docklands Luas.</P>
        <P>This is a very important debate.  We are all entitled to our political views and perspectives.  It is good, too, that we are able to share information and fight for our constituencies.  I hope the Minister of State will let the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, know we are doing that.</P>

        <P>When I spoke in the House nearly ten years ago of impending gridlock, I was laughed at, dismissed and considered guilty of hysterical exaggeration.  However, no one is laughing now or accusing me of exaggeration.  It is almost impossible to find words to describe just how difficult traffic conditions have become for people who live in and try to do business in Dublin.  Already, in the last two weeks we have seen two examples of genuine gridlock.  In both cases manageable incidents resulted, very quickly, in unmanageable chaos because of the sheer volume of traffic and the absence of public transport. I warn now, with no fear of being proved wrong, that if we think congestion is bad but will not get worse, we are very wrong.</P>
        <P>It is inevitable that matters will worsen.  Economic growth will be followed by population growth and the simple passage of time will mean more traffic.  When those traffic volumes are superimposed on existing congestion, gridlock incidents such as those we have witnessed, will become commonplace.  The tortuously slow travel times will become the norm.  Only five or six years ago, travel times of half the current levels were thought to be outrageous.  It shows what we are putting up with, as each year the congestion gets worse.</P>
        <P>It will not stop there, however.  Into this chaos must come the diggers, the JCBs, the tunnelling machines, the trucks and the machinery that will provide the metro, the extended Luas and the upgrade on the M50.  These are the ingredients that will give zest to the cocktail of traffic conges<Col N="735"/>tion that already exists.  No matter what we do now, or what ameliorative measures are taken, these works, albeit absolutely necessary, will bring street conditions from hell to Dublin.  It is pointless for the Minister of State to talk about developments that will come about in five years time.  That has nothing to do with what people will face next Monday and the week after.</P>
        <P>All we can hope and plan for now is some way to manage the hell that faces us.  It does not seem to be an overambitious target for a Government with endless resources just to try to keep the mayhem at bay.  Yet, the Minister of State does not seem to have any conception of the depth, severity or urgency of what is facing us.</P>
        <P>The Minister, the Minister of State and indeed the Taoiseach seem to think that simply announcing big capital projects is the end of the story; that somehow we can all put the need to move around on hold for the next five or ten years.  It is not until then that we will see the benefits from the investment in public transport.   Meanwhile, the construction of the proposed projects superimposed on congested conditions, will simply make matters worse.   Promises for the future, welcome as they are, must be accompanied by short-term actions to manage the mayhem.  That is all we can hope for.</P>
        <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I have consistently and persistently called for more buses.  Lowly, uncool and hard to hype buses they may be, but despite their poor and sometimes unloved image, they are the only form of transport that can be provided quickly and the sole option for taking a proportion of cars off the road.   We know that buses are not the whole solution but that does not mean we should just sit on our hands and do nothing.  Doing nothing is not an option any more.  Instead of growing the bus fleet and consequently the bus market, and responding to the calls of despairing populations going into these new isolated estates all around the M50 and further out, the Government has instead operated an entirely perverse policy of a zero increase in the fleet.  At the very time when they are most needed, suddenly the coffers were dry and no buses were available.  The result of this is that a static bus fleet is being spread over an increasing population and the ever growing geographic area Dublin Bus is serving.  In turn, this has resulted in a poorer service for people who are forced to take buses and an actual drop in the numbers travelling at peak times into the city centre.</P>
        <P>Simultaneously, more than &euro;117 million has been spent on bus lanes, which have removed valuable road space from car drivers who have no alternative means of transport.  Where buses were made available, they were taken from other areas so that people who had services found themselves deprived of them.  Commuters fume at the sight of underutilised bus lanes &mdash; and in some cases <Col N="736"/>bus lanes that have no buses at all, despite the money that was made available to build them.  Buses are not the whole solution, but they can in sufficient numbers make a genuine and quantifiable contribution by removing at least some cars from the road.  There is enormous unmet demand from commuters who have no hang-ups about using public transport.  If it is available and reasonably frequent and reliable, people will use it; indeed they are clamouring for it.</P>
        <P>Bus services must reflect the new polycentric city, not the limited single destination city of 20 years ago.  It must serve where people live, where they work and where they recreate.  The latter is becoming increasingly important.  Around Dublin and throughout the country people need to socialise and the new drink driving ban demands a safe public transport response.  Opening up the bus market could provide that response and at least partially serve the needs of those who have no scheduled bus services.</P>
        <P>The figures released today about the transport contribution to carbon emissions are enough to generate a crisis response in terms of buses instead of private cars.  Fine Gael has called for a liberalisation of the bus market in Dublin so that the private sector can, in conjunction with Dublin Bus, begin to respond to unmet demand.  We have called for a regulator to manage the network and ensure standards, but primarily we need the extra capacity, consumer orientation and the additional efficiencies competition can bring to this crucial problem in Dublin.</P>
        <P>There is no co-ordination or sense of urgency from Government.  Unless there is a press conference in prospect, the Minister is not involved.  The proactive finding and implementing of solutions, as well as responding to emerging issues is of no interest to the Minister.  He had the nerve to tell Members he was dismayed there had been no response to the money he had made available for park and ride facilities.  There has been no response for several years and the Minister did not feel any obligation to be in any way proactive or to wonder why people did not provide such facilities.  While the local authorities have expressed an interest in providing parking facilities, there is not much point unless people have something on which to ride when they park.  The Minister simply sits on his hands as though it had nothing to do with him.</P>
        <P>At present, the management of the road network is permanently on the brink of collapse and attention to immediate measures is vital.  Buses are one solution while traffic management is another.  This area has been completely neglected and it is beginning to show.  The traffic corps is overwhelmed by the demands made on it and even with Operation Freeflow, it is unable to cope.  The critical junctions and heavily trafficked areas are still unmanned.  The traffic corps must be supplemented with mobile, specially trained <Col N="737"/>and patrolling civilian traffic managers or with similar teams drawn from the Garda Reserve.  As traffic congestion becomes more acute, traffic management becomes all the more vital.</P>
        <P>As for communications, more traffic lights should be attached to the SCATS system in the city centre.  Of course, there is no point in so doing if no one is looking at them or if no one communicates to those on the ground who could do something about problems.  Far more attention and focus on traffic management is required.  More buses, more focused bus services and a liberalisation of the bus market in order that there can be a response to local demand is also needed.</P>
        <P>The city is now so close to chaos that we must assiduously manage our road network or face recurring gridlock incidents, such as those which have been experienced recently, as well as ever higher levels of stress among the hapless commuters of Dublin.  Ultimately, the economy will collapse as it becomes ever more difficult to conduct business in the capital city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, for sharing her time and I support this motion.  No one wishes to be negative regarding the country&rsquo;s growth and everyone is proud of the new roads and dual carriageways that have been opened.  I was on such a road in County Westmeath last week and it was great to see it.</P>
        <P>Given the introduction of Operation Freeflow for the Christmas period, I did not anticipate the number of telephone calls I have received from my constituents.  This was also the case for Government Members as everyone received calls regarding commuters who were caught in traffic for three or four hours for the past two weeks, when the problems were meant to have eased.</P>
        <P>Members recently had a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, on road safety.  I recall making the point that there is no co-operation whatsoever between the different bodies in Dublin or in the country.  I visited the Minister of State&rsquo;s native County Donegal two weeks ago with Senator McHugh and the position there does not differ from that in County Meath or in Dublin.  While the problem may be on a smaller scale, there are times of the day when one experiences massive chaos outside schools or whatever.  In counties Donegal and Meath, as well as in Dublin, one experiences chaos outside schools and when entering or leaving towns.</P>
        <P>Someone must take the bull by the horns and admit that while Ireland is a great country and while roads are being built, it is not working.  Until a collective decision is taken by all the bodies involved in transport, there is no point in blaming the present Government and then facing the same issues when Fine Gael is in Government.</P><Col N="738"/>
        <P>Last week, I met hauliers&rsquo; representatives who informed me they are about to go out of business because of the gridlock in Ireland, as well as the foreign hauliers who come and put them out of business.  This will be the case until Dublin becomes a city like others, in which one begins to create jobs outside the major urban centres.  Not everyone should be obliged to go through the same gap every day like sheep.  This point annoys me when travelling to the D&aacute;il on a daily basis.  In the morning, two free traffic lanes come out of the city without anyone on them.  Moreover, everyone sits in one lane, while an empty traffic lane lies to one&rsquo;s left.  It would be a simple matter to notify commuters better that one can travel on some bus lanes at certain times; they should be opened to traffic more frequently.</P>
        <P>As for the M50 and tolls, the day has come when the barriers must be lifted.  If the authorities wish to continue collecting their money, people who do not throw in their toll money can be fined.  However, the barriers should be lifted and this has proved possible in other countries.  The registration numbers of those who try to break the barrier can be picked up, they can be fined and traffic can flow freely.</P>
        <P>My colleague&rsquo;s comments that jobs are suffering were true and thousands of hours are lost due to traffic chaos.  This happens not only in Dublin, but in every town in Ireland.  For example, the town of Navan is a nightmare.  Those in business suffer as people refuse to enter such towns because they are unable to leave them.   With regard to co-operation between the different bodies, I believe the Minister of State commented that people find it hard to agree.  Someone strong must make the decision as to what must be done in respect of transport.  Everyone must pull their weight and individuals must consider what is best for the people, rather than for their particular organisation because people are at breaking point.</P>
        <P>Members of all parties will agree that the telephone calls last week were raw and abusive, and rightly so.  People were stuck in traffic for three and a half hours on the M50.  They could not get off the motorway and were unable to get to work, simply due to an incident involving a single car.  Having met representatives of the National Roads Authority, NRA, I am confident we have the money and people to increase the number of possible projects.  The NRA has stated it has the capacity to carry out more projects if it received funding.  Members must anticipate the position in 2020 and must accept there will be an additional 1.5 million people.  As Irish people love to have their own cars and do not wish to be confined to buses, there will be an additional 600,000 or 700,000 cars.</P>
        <P>We must have the will and foresight to spend the money and broaden our infrastructure as otherwise this issue will destroy the country.  I <Col N="739"/>recognise the top-class work that has been done.  As I noted last week, the Tyrrellspass project was one year ahead of schedule and everyone there, regardless of their party affiliations, was proud of it.  Hopefully, Fine Gael will be in power next year as someone must state that while the money spent heretofore has been spent well, the manner in which we conduct our business is not good enough.</P>
        <P>Every bus lane must be full in the morning.  People have asked me why there are not three inbound lanes and one outbound in the morning.  This could be changed in the evening to have three outbound lanes and one inbound lane.  At present, commuters are like sheep who all go through the same gap in the morning and evening.  It can take two and half to three hours to return home in the evening.  I live 40 miles away and can leave my house at 7.45 a.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.  It then takes until 10.30 a.m. to get to Leinster House.  However, I could leave my house one hour later and would still arrive by 10.30 a.m.  Something is wrong in this regard.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise an issue pertaining to transport safety that concerns Leinster House and someone should pick up on it.  Leaving Leinster House from the back gate to try to get out on to the road is a serious problem.  One has no vision, cyclists pass by and there will be an accident.  While I do not know who will pick up this issue, it is serious.  Perhaps the Minister of State will ask someone to examine this matter, which has been raised by many people.</P>

	<P>I hope the interchange between the M50 and the port tunnel will work from the road hauliers&rsquo; perspective.  We will find out in a few weeks time.  Fine Gael Members do not want to complain it is not working.  All Members hope it will work because the number of lorries travelling through the city is too high and until they are removed from the city, matters will not improve.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I return to the business of jobs.  Jobs are being lost because of the failure to be able to move freely, be it in Dublin, Kerry, Donegal or Galway.  Representatives of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, the metro and the various rail organisations must sit down together, but we must have a Minister who is prepared to bang heads together to ensure that our transport system is one of which everybody is proud.  If they can have successful systems in <Col N="740"/>other European countries, I do not see why we cannot have them here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to introduce this Bill, the first of two intended to implement the largest social welfare package in the history of the State of &euro;1.41 billion announced last week in the budget.  This substantial investment brings total expenditure on social welfare in 2007 to &euro;15.3 billion.  In simple terms that means that &euro;1 for every &euro;3 of Government day-to-day spending goes directly into welfare entitlements and supports.  In total, week in, week out, some 1.5 million people will benefit from the significant increases and improvements in the budget that will protect and improve the living standards of social welfare recipients.</P>
        <P>This budget is about delivering on this Government&rsquo;s commitments in the programme for Government by bringing the State non-contributory pension to &euro;200 a week and realising the 2007 target for the lowest social welfare rates.  With increases in the qualified adult allowances, a pensioner on a State contributory pension will be better off by almost &euro;40 per week.  In addition, the lowest rate of social welfare payments have increased by 12.1%, far in excess of the expected increase of 4.5% in private sector earnings and almost three times the forecast rate of inflation for 2007.</P>
        <P>As well as massive income support improvements of over &euro;970 million, another &euro;430 million &mdash; nearly one third of the total package &mdash; is being directed to support a range of significant reform measures, including confronting and tackling remaining child poverty, increasing income supports for all pensioners, recognising and supporting carers and those with disabilities, and increasing the status and incomes of women.  These are major structural reforms which, when taken with a number of other reforms and changes being implemented or progressed, particularly in the areas of lone parents and pensions, <Col N="741"/>will contribute greatly to the overall policy reform agenda that I have been pursuing for the past two years.  These reforms on child poverty, carer&rsquo;s support, women&rsquo;s incomes and pensions are about more than just increasing incomes.  They are important and necessary structural reforms that create change, open up fresh opportunities and deliver enlightened social policy.</P>
        <P>On many occasions I have described child poverty as totally unacceptable in the prosperous and progressive Ireland of the 21st century.  Childhood deprivation can leave lasting marks on children by impeding their development and curbing their life chances.  It is not just the child who suffers &mdash; society also loses, for children are its wealth and its future.</P>
        <P>Since my first days in this portfolio I have been determined to make the changes and reforms that will make a lasting impact on child poverty.  It is a complex area that overall requires an integrated, joined-up Government response such as that envisaged in Towards 2016, which lays out an ambitious programme of priority actions for the next ten years.  In the meantime, I am determined that further progress must be made in tackling remaining child poverty.  That is why at the core of this welfare budget is the commitment to an even stronger and more focused campaign.  We have already travelled some distance towards eliminating hardship and deprivation.  In recent years we have lifted more than 250,000 people, including 100,000 children, out of poverty, but there is still a distance to travel and now it behoves us all to redouble our efforts and complete the task.</P>
        <P>I have long held the view that implementing a second tier of payment for children in low income and welfare families is the most effective method of confronting and significantly reducing remaining child poverty.  While child benefit remains the main overall support for families with children, I now intend introducing in this Bill a new single high rate qualified child allowance, formerly known as child dependant allowance, targeted at families on welfare where children are most at risk of poverty.  This involves combining the current three qualified child allowance rates into a single rate of &euro;22 per week, which will now apply to all social welfare schemes and will be paid for over 340,000 children of welfare families.  For those on the current lower rates of &euro;16.80 and &euro;19.30 per child per week, this represents a substantial improvement, particularly when taken with child benefit and other increases.</P>
        <P>Child dependant allowances have remained unchanged since 1994 because they were viewed as a disincentive in moving people from welfare to work but, as we all know, the Ireland of 1994 is not the Ireland of 2006.  The labour market has changed dramatically.  The introduction of the national minimum wage, the national employment action plan and the re-focussing of the <Col N="742"/>family income supplement scheme, to name but a few initiatives over the past decade or more, have all served to further reduce the impact of the loss of qualified child allowance in the decision to take up full-time employment.  This message has been further reinforced by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and many other welfare groups, who strongly supported increasing the qualified child allowance.  I view this improved and targeted allowance as representing a substantial move in the direction of a second-tier payment and that is why in this budget I have deliberately taken the decision to focus increased child supports in this area.</P>
        <P>The budget included a number of other targeted measures to address the position of children in low income households.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance provides vital additional income support for poorer families at a particularly difficult and stressful time of the year.  That is why I am increasing the allowance by &euro;60 for children aged two to 11, and by &euro;95 for children aged 12 to 22, bringing the rates of payment to &euro;180 and &euro;285, respectively, an increase of 50%.  Over just two budgets this allowance has nearly doubled in value.</P>
        <P>Another important weapon in tackling remaining child poverty is the family income supplement, FIS, which provides cash support for low earning employees with families, while at the same time maintaining incentives to enter or remain in employment.  I was particularly encouraged by the impact of this year&rsquo;s FIS improvements, and also the response to the awareness campaign undertaken by my Department which has resulted in an increase of over 20% &mdash; to 21,400 families &mdash; in those receiving FIS.  As all the evidence is that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families, last year&rsquo;s budget re-focused the FIS weekly earnings thresholds in favour of such families and I have followed this approach again this year in this legislation.  Consequently, average payments per child will increase to nearly &euro;50.  It is also anticipated that the changes in the thresholds will entitle approximately 5,600 additional families to the payment.</P>
        <P>Everyone is entitled to a basic standard of living.  All are entitled to a decent pension and security and dignity in their later years.  I have repeatedly stated my conviction that this generation will be judged on how it uses the fruits of the economic miracle of recent years to help those most vulnerable in society.  We have a responsibility to assist those who for reasons of age, health or other circumstances need the financial lifeline that is welfare support to help them through bad times and to offer hope and encouragement towards better times.</P>
        <P>This Government has committed itself to delivering a number of specific and ambitious improvements in social welfare rates by 2007.  At the core of this commitment was the pledge to <Col N="743"/>bring the basic State pension to &euro;200 per week.  I am pleased that we are able to deliver on this promise by increasing the State non-contributory pension by &euro;18 a week to &euro;200 with effect from next January, and the State contributory pension to over &euro;209 per week.</P>
        <P>The needs of older people have been, and will remain, a priority for this Government.  That has been repeatedly demonstrated by the numerous initiatives which have been taken over the past ten years or so in the areas of pensions, supports for carers and household benefits such as free electricity, gas and telephones.  For instance, since 1996, and including increases granted in the current year, pensions have increased by almost 119%, or approximately 57% in real terms &mdash; faster than both price and wages growth over the period.</P>
        <P>All the more recent indicators, including the latest EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions for 2005, show the progress which is being made in significantly improving the well-being of older people.  The EU survey found that consistent poverty rates for older people were very low at 3.7%, and that was before the many benefits flowing from budget 2006, and the many and significant increases and improvements announced in last week&rsquo;s budget for 2007, are taken into account.</P>
        <P>In budget 2006, for the first time in many years, I increased the basic income disregard for the purposes of the means test for the State non-contributory pension to &euro;20 per week.  At the same time, I introduced incentives for pensioners on means-tested payments who may wish to continue in employment by providing for allowed earnings of &euro;100 per week.  I am happy to be able to build on these improvements by increasing the basic means disregard to &euro;30 per week, and at the same time building on the employment incentives provided this year by increasing the allowed earnings to &euro;200 per week.  These measures will benefit approximately 26,000 pensioners who are currently in receipt of a reduced rate of pension.  They will, of course, also benefit from the general &euro;18 per week increase in the personal rate of payment and, where relevant, the &euro;11.90 increases in the qualified adult rate.  In other words, many non-contributory pensioner couples will gain by over &euro;46 per week from these combined measures, with effect from next January.</P>
        <P>We all share a wish that older people have security and comfort in their later years.  Meeting household heating costs, particularly through the winter months, can be a cause of concern and anxiety for older people.  Increases in energy and fuel prices only add to these anxieties.  That is why we have taken action to protect older people from the impact of price increases.  Last year, I increased the fuel allowance by &euro;5 a week to &euro;14 and this year I am increasing it by a further &euro;4 <Col N="744"/>to &euro;18 a week.  Therefore, the level of the fuel allowance, which is paid to 274,000 recipients, will have doubled in the past two years.</P>
        <P>This is not the only measure being taken to address fuel poverty and to alleviate the worries of elderly people.  As the Taoiseach announced in September, from next January the number of free units of electricity and gas paid under the household benefits scheme will increase significantly by 600 units a year to 2,400 units at a cost of &euro;50 million.</P>
        <P>A number of other improvements have been made over the past few years to the household benefits package for older people.  In this budget I am introducing a number of further enhancements which, for example, take account of changing trends in society and the impact of technology.  From next April, it will be possible for pensioners and others who qualify to have the free telephone allowance paid in respect of either mobile phones or fixed land-lines.  This will allow older people to have more flexibility and mobiles can also be reassuring from a security point of view.  More than 320,000 people will benefit from the telephone allowance this year.</P>
        <P>I am also extending the automatic entitlement to a free travel companion pass to pensioners aged under 75 who are medically unfit to travel unaccompanied.  Early 2007 will see the introduction of all-Ireland free travel which will deliver all-island free travel for all pensioners, North and South.</P>
        <P>The Government is concerned about retirement income now and in the future.  We all know the demographic pressures our pensions system will face in the future.  While we are facing a pensions problem, unlike many other countries with less favourable demographics, we are not yet facing a crisis.  It is critically important that we use the time we have available to find the pensions solutions for tomorrow.  Everyone is entitled to adequate income, dignity and security in their older years.  I am determined that we will work towards delivering adequate retirement income to all our citizens which does not place an unsustainable burden on future taxpayers.</P>
        <P>Pensions are now high up on the national agenda.  The past two years have seen considerable movement and a completely new focus.  The two reports published by the Pensions Board over the past year &mdash; the national pensions review and savings for retirement<i> &mdash; </i>require serious debate and analysis.  I was pleased to see pensions at the centre of the social partnership negotiations for Towards 2016.  The agreement features a number of commitments in this area, including the publication of a Green Paper on pensions outlining the major policy choices and challenges which I intend to publish by the end of March 2007.  After a consultation process, the Government will develop a framework for comprehensively <Col N="745"/>addressing the pensions agenda over the long term.</P>
        <P>Carers make a valued and valuable contribution to society by devoting their time and energy to improving the quality of life of others.  I am determined that their dedication and sacrifice will be recognised and acknowledged through increased benefits and improved support measures.  Since 1997, the Government has been committed to supporting care in the community to the maximum possible extent.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes &mdash; such as the respite care grant and carer&rsquo;s benefit &mdash; have been introduced and extended.  As a result of these improvements, almost 28,500 carers are in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>Our commitment to carers has been further reinforced in the partnership agreement Towards 2016.  We are committed to the development and publication of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy next year which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to announce further reforms, increases and improvements to the income supports available to carers which builds on the significant progress of recent years.  As I have said on many occasions, the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and the rules generally specify that only one weekly welfare payment can be paid to an individual.  Until now, the rule has been that those qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  I am aware that this has been a cause of particular concern to people in receipt of one social welfare payment when they become carers.  Indeed, the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, chaired by Deputy Penrose, made specific recommendations in this regard which I have taken into account.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I am introducing fundamental structural reforms in this area.  In future, people in receipt of certain social welfare payments who are also providing full-time care and attention to a person will be able to retain the main welfare payment and also receive another payment, equivalent of up to half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The reform of the system and the abolition of the old rule that one cannot get two welfare payments means that for the first time people who are caring can have some real recognition of their caring duties.  Introducing the new dual payment system means we will be starting to recognise the carer&rsquo;s allowance less as a welfare income payment and more as a direct support for caring duties and responsibilities.  I consider this reform to be an important step forward and I am deter<Col N="746"/>mined to press ahead with other needed reforms and improvements in the caring area.</P>
        <P>It is estimated some 14,000 people are currently in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance who would also have an entitlement to another welfare payment, while a further 4,000 carers are also in receipt of other welfare payments.  This means that some 18,000 carers should qualify for a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance of up to &euro;109 per week.  The precise details of this arrangement are currently being examined by my Department and will be set out in the next social welfare Bill.</P>
        <P>The budget delivered an investment of more than &euro;107 million in a comprehensive carers package.  This included an annual respite care grant increase of &euro;300 to &euro;1,500 which will benefit almost 40,000 carers; increases of &euro;18 and &euro;20 in the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit which will directly benefit 28,500 carers; the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance was eased with income disregard increased by &euro;30 to &euro;320 per week for a single person and by &euro;60 to &euro;640 for a couple, meaning that a couple with two children can earn up to &euro;36,240 and still receive the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the free travel and household benefits.  The easing of the means test will allow an additional 1,200 carers to qualify for payment and 2,500 existing carers to receive increases in weekly payments.  The earning threshold for carer&rsquo;s benefit increased by &euro;30 to &euro;320 per week.  Grants of &euro;500,000 were made available for carers&rsquo; organisations.</P>
        <P>These improvements, together with the improvements in home care and related services announced by the Minister for Health and Children, represent a further advancement of our vision of a co-ordinated approach to services and supports for carers in the community.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that with this Bill I will be achieving one of the principal commitments in my Department&rsquo;s disability sectoral plan.  As a result of their residency, people in residential care prior to August 1999, or those who entered residential care after that date without an entitlement to disability allowance, are disqualified from receipt of the allowance.  This was partially addressed in budget 2005 when I introduced a new disability allowance personal expenses rate, currently payable at &euro;35 per week to 2,700 people in residential care.  This payment replaced, at a standardised and higher rate, the so-called pocket money spending allowances which had previously been paid to some of these residents.</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased to now provide for the eligibility in their own right to disability allowance to all persons resident in institutions, subject only to the same conditions as apply to others.  This will ensure that all persons with disability in residential care have an entitlement to an income maintenance payment and are treated in the same way as other social welfare recipients.</P><Col N="747"/>
        <P>In further advances in the area of disability, the Citizens Information Bill 2006, which is currently being debated by this House, lays the statutory foundation for the provision of a personal advocacy service to people with disabilities.  I am providing for a further &euro;1.9 million to Comhairle, soon to be renamed the Citizens Information Board, to continue the development of this and related services next year.</P>
        <P>In delivering on the commitment to greater gender equality in the welfare system and in making the welfare code fairer to women, the Bill includes important reforms that will lead to more enlightened social policies in the pensions area.  Increasing the rate of qualified adult allowance for the spouses and partners of contributory pensioners by &euro;23.70 per week will directly benefit 35,500 couples.  It will bring the rate of qualified adult allowance payments for those aged 66 and over to 86.5% of the target rate contained in the Government commitment of bringing the rate up to the rate of the non-contributory State pension.  There is now a &euro;60 million commitment to reaching that target in the next three years.</P>
        <P>In the next social welfare Bill, to be presented to the House in February, I intend to provide for the qualified adult&rsquo;s entitlement to the qualified adult allowance for the duration of the entitlement of a State pensioner.  As most qualified adults are women, this decision will be of particular benefit to them as it will, in most cases, transform the payment into what is in effect a woman&rsquo;s pension in her own right as distinct from being a dependant allowance.  I also intend to provide for this payment to be made directly to the qualified adult.  It will remain open to any qualified adult to continue to have his or her portion of the pension paid jointly with that of the State pensioner if that is what they wish.</P>
        <P>I am also proposing to significantly reform the manner in which spouses and partners are assessed as qualified adults across a range of social assistance schemes and, in particular, the treatment of part-time and low-paid work done by qualified adults.  The proposed reform involves assessing both members of a couple in a similar manner, with common disregards and assessments applying to both.  I will also remove the poverty traps that are present in the current method of assessment.  For example, at certain income levels if a woman increases her income from part-time employment to over &euro;100 per week, her spouse or partner can lose &euro;1.20 from his jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for every &euro;1 she earns in excess of the disregard.  Clearly this situation has no place in a modern system of employment supports.</P>
        <P>Under the reforms proposed, increases in labour market participation will instead be rewarded and this will facilitate women in moving beyond the occupational cul-de-sac of indefinite <Col N="748"/>part-time employment with earnings kept below &euro;100 per week.  Both partners will now be able to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in their own right.  This will also facilitate women in particular to access the range of employment supports and training opportunities that go with receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  I am confident that these proposals will significantly reduce the complexity in the present system, while recognising and rewarding increased labour market participation by all, particularly by women.</P>
        <P>This Bill also introduces two beneficial measures which will assist widows and widowers at a particularly difficult time in their lives, namely, in the immediate aftermath of the death of their spouse.  Financial worries add to the stresses experienced at such times.  Not only do widows and widowers have to cover the cost of a funeral but often they also have to cope with the sudden loss of an income.  The six weeks after death payment paid to the survivors of social welfare recipients are intended to ease this financial strain.  In addition, my Department makes once-off payments to assist with immediate costs.  To help ease the financial strains at this sensitive time, the widowed parent grant is being increased by &euro;1,300 to &euro;4,000 while the bereavement grant will be increased by &euro;215 to &euro;850.</P>
        <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Sections 2 and 3, together with Schedules 1 and 2, provide for an increase of &euro;16 for contributory State pensioners, widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s contributory pensioners, those in receipt of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit aged 66 and over and people on State pension transition and invalidity pensions aged 65 and over.  An increase of &euro;18 per week is provided for those in receipt of non-contributory State pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Recipients of invalidity and widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pensions, as well as those in receipt of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit and carer&rsquo;s benefit, will receive an increase of &euro;20 per week.  Payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and allowance, illness benefit, one-parent family payment, disability allowance, supplementary welfare allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance, farm assist and guardian&rsquo;s payment are all increased by &euro;20 per week.</P>
        <P>These increases will bring the elderly pension rates to &euro;209.30 and &euro;200, with carer&rsquo;s allowance recipients aged over 66 receiving &euro;218 per week.  The lowest payments, such as illness benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and supplementary welfare allowance will reach &euro;185.80 per week, with those on carer&rsquo;s allowance aged under 66 receiving &euro;200 per week.</P>
        <P>Weekly increases in respect of qualified adults, ranging from &euro;23.70 in the case of contributory and transition State pensions where the qualified adult is over 66 years of age to &euro;10.70 if under 66, will ensure that the existing proportional relationship between all personal rates of payment and <Col N="749"/>that of their associated qualified adult allowances, is either significantly increased to almost 83% in the case of the former or maintained at over 66% in the case of the latter.</P>
        <P>These sections of the Bill also provide for increases in the qualified child allowance rates to bring the existing three rates up to a single standard rate of &euro;22 per week.  Where reduced rates of payment apply, proportionate increases apply.  All personal, qualified adult and qualified child increases take effect from the first week in January 2007.</P>
        <P>Increases for recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and allowance, illness and maternity benefit, one-parent family payment, family income supplement, farm assist and supplementary welfare payments will be paid from the first payday in January 2007.  Due to the lead-in times involved in the production of personal payable orders for certain long-term payments such as pensions, it will not be possible for budgetary increases to be paid immediately, in such cases, from January next.  Some 142,000 recipients of, for example, widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s, carer&rsquo;s and invalidity payments, will receive their new order books in mid-February.  This group will receive six weeks&rsquo; arrears of its budget increase, which will be included in the first order of the new book, and the weekly increase will be incorporated in their normal weekly payment thereafter.</P>
        <P>Certain other long-term recipients, such as State pensioners and those in receipt of disability allowance &mdash; some 276,000 customers &mdash; will receive new pension order books at the end of March.  This group will receive a special once-off payment in mid-February representing 12 weeks of their budgetary increase.  This will cover retrospection of the increase to January plus an advance payment of the increase to the end of March.  From the book renewal date at end of March, the increase will be incorporated in the normal weekly payment.</P>
        <P>As already mentioned, section 4 provides for increases in the weekly income thresholds applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement.  The new thresholds will range from &euro;480 for a family with one child to &euro;1,090 for a family of eight or more children.  For example, a family with three children on &euro;500, or about two thirds of gross average industrial weekly earnings, will receive &euro;75 in 2007 compared with &euro;39 currently &mdash; an increase of &euro;36 per week.</P>
        <P>Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill provide for changes in PRSI.  In budget 2006 the threshold for liability to the employee element of PRSI was set at &euro;300 per week.  This was equivalent to the entry point to taxation.  The measure ensured that an employee earning up to this threshold amount, which was slightly higher than the annualised equivalent of the minimum wage rate for 2006, would not be subject to tax or PRSI.  With a view to maintaining this position in 2007, the weekly <Col N="750"/>threshold is set, in section 5 of this Bill, at &euro;339, which is, at &euro;17,628 per annum, slightly above the threshold of &euro;17,600 for payment of income tax for employees under 65.</P>
        <P>Sections 5 and 6 provide that the earnings ceiling for employee&rsquo;s social insurance contributions and the income ceiling for optional contributors are increased by &euro;2,200 from &euro;46,600 to &euro;48,800 per annum with effect from 1 January 2007.  This is an increase of approximately 4.8% and is in line with projected earnings increases.  The increase was contained in the Abridged Estimates Volume, published earlier this year.</P>
        <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for an increase of four weeks, from 22 weeks to 26 weeks, in the duration of maternity benefit.  Section 8 provides for an increase of four weeks, from 20 to 24, in the duration of adoptive benefit.  These improvements take effect from 1 March 2007.</P>
        <P>As already mentioned, section 9 and Schedule 1 to the Bill provide for an increase of &euro;1,300 to &euro;4,000 in the widowed parent grant and &euro;215 to &euro;850 in the bereavement and death benefit grants.  All these increases take effect from budget day.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for an increase of &euro;10, from &euro;20 to &euro;30, in the weekly means disregard for non-contributory State pension means testing purposes from January 5, the same day the budget increase of &euro;18 per week comes into effect.  This means, for example, that a pensioner with weekly means of &euro;30 per week will receive a pension in 2007 of &euro;200 per week instead of a pension of &euro;172 per week in December 2006, a net gain of &euro;28 per week, &euro;18 arising from the rate increase and &euro;10 from the increase in the means disregard.</P>
        <P>Likewise, a pensioner with means of &euro;100 per week and a pension of &euro;102 per week in December 2006, will get &euro;130 per week from January, also a gain of &euro;28 per week.  Nearly 26,000 pensioners will gain from the increase in the disregard.</P>
        <P>Section 11 makes provision, as outlined earlier, for the payment of full-rate disability allowance to those in residential institutions.  The legislation providing for the introduction of self-employed or class S contributions in 1988 excluded from liability self-employed workers whose total income was below a threshold of &pound;2,500, equivalent to &euro;3,174 per annum.  This threshold correlated approximately with the rate of non-contributory old age pension for a single person.  The level at which a self-employed person becomes eligible for class S contributions has remained unchanged over the past 18 years.</P>
        <P>At the time, those who engaged in self-employment but were entitled to unemployment assistance were excluded from liability for PRSI in view of their low income levels.  This principle carried over to the introduction of farm assist in 1999, when it was again accepted that a person <Col N="751"/>should not have a PRSI liability where he or she was on sufficiently low income to warrant entitlement to a means-tested payment.</P>
        <P>Over the years, the threshold for class S liability has remained unchanged while there have also been significant improvements in disregards for means-tested schemes, notably relating to farm assist.  Therefore, a self-employed worker who is in receipt of farm assist or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance may only maintain his or her contribution record by opting into the voluntary contribution scheme.  In this context, it is desirable to improve access to social insurance coverage and enable continuing social insurance protection, specifically the accrual of contributions towards a contributory State pension, by removing the exemption from PRSI liability for those in receipt of farm assist and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  I am providing for this in section 12 of this Bill.</P>
        <P>To ensure that the position of those on lower incomes is protected, the health contribution levy threshold is being increased by &euro;40, from &euro;440 to &euro;480 per week, with the corresponding annual threshold being increased from &euro;22,880 to &euro;24,960.  Furthermore, an additional 0.5% is being introduced in respect of income to the extent that it exceeds &euro;100,100 per year or is equivalent to &euro;1,925 per week.  This increase, which is expected to affect only the top 10% of earners, is effective from 1 January 2007.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Bill 2006, the first of two instalments, builds further on the considerable progress that has been made in recent years.  It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare income and other supports and prioritises the allocation of resources to those most in need.  The Bill is also about solid and fundamental structural reforms of welfare policies &mdash; reforms that will modernise, will make the welfare system fairer to all and will deliver more enlightened social policies.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>As always, the Opposition assures the Minister of a constructive debate.  I thank him for asking his officials to brief Opposition Deputies on the Bill, which was helpful.  I hope that the practice will continue.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister must be one of the happiest Ministers in history to have so much money to give away.  I will not be churlish because the Bill has many good aspects.  One cannot give away &euro;1.41 billion as the Minister is doing without helping many people or making them happy.  We must remember that people have paid this money to the Exchequer through taxation, particularly indirect tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty and so on.  We are redistributing their money.</P><Col N="752"/>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The Combat Poverty Agency stated that last year&rsquo;s package was more progressive than regressive.  According to the agency, previous years&rsquo; packages were regressive, but there is a trend leading away from that situation.  The Opposition has sought evenly distributed payments to target the most needy, which is finally being done.  I compliment the Minister in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the first page of his speech, the Minister referred to &ldquo;important and necessary structural reforms that create change, open up fresh opportunities and deliver enlightened social policies&rdquo;.  While the Minister has gone a long way in this respect, there is further to go, which I am sure he will acknowledge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first issue mentioned in the Minister&rsquo;s speech was child poverty, which he described as &ldquo;totally unacceptable in the prosperous and progressive Ireland of the 21st century&rdquo;.  He should examine an article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> by Mr. Fergus Finlay, the head of Barnardos, who describes an experience of a child care worker dealing with a child from an extraordinarily deprived background.  Going to school at the age of four or five years, the child is already old and has been through a lifetime of awful experiences.  The child is typical in many areas where streets have no signposts in order to confuse garda&iacute; searching for drug dealers, criminals and so forth.</P>
        <P>Today, that underbelly was evident in the shooting dead of an innocent bystander in this city.  We must tackle this underbelly, at the root of much of which is poverty.  While children suffer child poverty, the Minister was right to say that society also suffers in that children are society&rsquo;s wealth and future.  Speaking as a former teacher, primary school teachers will identify the child in junior infants who will go to prison as a young adult.  We must intervene before that point. We need a structured pre-school system, particularly for children lacking support at home.  We need to examine the cr&egrave;che system and the child care sector.</P>
        <P>For some time, the Minister has spoken of a second tier payment.  In his reply he might tell me that I am wrong but I understood that it was to be an amalgamation of the CDA, back to school and FIS payments and targeted, possibly automatically, at the families most in need of it.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility to do.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amalgamation of the three CDA payments and the increase to &euro;22, which the Opposition called for previously.</P>
        <P>What of the Minister&rsquo;s other vision that he shared with the House two years ago or more, namely, a special, targeted second tier payment?  The Minister obliged the Opposition&rsquo;s calls for advertising campaigns to increase the take-up of the back to school clothing and footwear and FIS payments.  While they were successful to a certain point, some people have still not availed of the <Col N="753"/>payments.  A means of doing more would be to make automatic payments, which should be possible in this day and age.</P>
        <P>Recently, I suggested that the deadline for claiming the back to school clothing and footwear payment be extended to the end of November if not the end of the year, but I was disappointed when the Minister, who I have privately and publicly said is progressive, bluntly said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Regularly, people attend my clinics and office and say that they never knew about the payment.  They would have claimed it if they had known, but it was too late by that stage.  They can apply for exceptional needs payments, but those are not the same as the back to school payment and are messier.  These people are entitled to the back to school payment.</P>
        <P>September is a busy time for parents.  They must prepare children for school and there are many hassles, worries and things to do.  It is simple to forget, fail to go about claiming or not to know of the back to school clothing and footwear payment.  It should not incur an additional cost to extend the deadline to the end of November so that those entitled to it can make their claims.  As it is an administrative issue, I do not know why the Minister said he had no plans to extend the deadline and would not consider the matter.  It was unlike him and I appeal to him to re-examine this modest proposal.</P>
        <P>If people find out about the payment &mdash; that they can get it from community welfare officers if their families are on low incomes, have a certain number of children and so on &mdash; when they meet other parents at school gates in the first or second week of October, it is already too late.  I do not know whether the Minister would need to issue a directive or administrative order to community welfare officers or whether legislation would be required, but he should consider the matter.</P>
        <P>I meant to state at the outset that the social welfare debate, what the Minister is doing and the budget are important and fundamental.  Is it not amazing that this debate is taking place in the last week before Christmas, that we will continue until 11 p.m. tonight, the graveyard shift if ever there was one, and that it will be guillotined tomorrow?  Reading through the Minister&rsquo;s speech, it struck me that certain payments, while commencing in January, will not be made until the middle of February for all kinds of administrative reasons.  Why can this process not be commenced earlier than the Christmas holiday deadline?  It would give us time to debate the matter and for the payments to be made in January.  An election will intervene, but the issue could be examined for the future.  We should not be debating the important issue of social welfare and all that goes with it while heading towards the midnight hour.</P>
        <P>Like everyone, pensioners are entitled to a basic standard of living.  I welcome that the Mini<Col N="754"/>ster has kept his promise to increase the basic rate for those under 80 years of age to &euro;209.30.  With all the pressures and expenses that now exist, should the increase have been more?  Some agencies were seeking more but it is welcome and we acknowledge that it was done.  Older people need it because they worry about having enough money and the future.</P>
        <P>I regret that another worry has been added to that list &mdash; that there will be a bill for their dependants after their deaths to pay nursing home charges.  Do we really need to do that?  The Government should reconsider this because it will add to the worries of those who have worked all their lives.  Such a fear could cause them to hand their houses over earlier to avoid this death tax.</P>
        <P>The fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 last year but only &euro;4 this year.  I expected the same increase at least this year because fuel prices have increased so much.  From January, however, the number of free units of electricity and gas will increase, which is welcome.  Older people need heat more than the rest of us.  It has been argued that the time for the fuel allowance should be extended by four weeks, starting two weeks earlier and ending two weeks later in the year.  We should consider that next year.</P>
        <P>Pensions policy was mentioned by the Minister.  It is a major issue and many models exist.  The cost to the State of tax foregone through pension investment is heading for &euro;3 billion per year, a huge amount.  The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs held hearings on this and some witnesses expressed concern about the way some of the current schemes are being administered.  The Minister should ensure the Pensions Board has enough power to carry out its functions because &euro;3 billion is a huge amount to forego each year.  We must shine a light on this.  I welcome the publication of a Green Paper on pensions but by the time anyone gets around to looking at it, we will be on the other side of the election.  We must, however, debate this topic.</P>
        <P>The Government has done much for carers.  I welcome the half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance now payable to people in receipt of another social welfare payment, although we are yet to hear which payments will be allowed.  The Minister must have read Fine Gael policy in this area because that was one of the key elements when we drafted a policy on carers.  I must rewrite it now.  I congratulate the Minister, however, because this will help many people.  There was an anomaly that when people reached a certain age, they had to make a choice between the State pension and the carer&rsquo;s allowance when they were still caring for a person.  It was unfair.</P>
        <P>Carers do a great deal of work and we all agree we should try to maintain those who need care in their own homes for as long as possible.  People prefer to stay in their own homes with their own <Col N="755"/>possessions and live longer as a result.  I visited Denmark this year and it was remarkable.  The Danish stopped building nursing homes in 1997 because the home care and rehabilitation is so good.  People who have a stroke enjoy immediate occupational and speech therapy and physiotherapy.  The person is back on his or her feet as soon as possible.  That is certainly not the case here, where the policy is to get someone into a nursing home at huge cost to the State and to the person&rsquo;s dignity and independence.  I support the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s policy of trying to keep people in their own homes.  We must refocus to make services available to allow for proper care in people&rsquo;s own homes.  The spouse&rsquo;s means test removes the recognition of a carer&rsquo;s work, however, because the spouse&rsquo;s income can lead to a carer receiving a reduced amount or nothing at all.  We must reconsider this.</P>
        <P>We have called for some time for the disability allowance to be payable to people in institutions as a matter of right.  The HSE takes back 80% anyway so it is a case of swings and roundabouts.  Recognition of the need for such a measure is important even if the State is giving with one hand and taking with the other.</P>
        <P>For many years we talked about the effect of the marriage bar.  If it was introduced now it would be found to be unconstitutional.  The Minister has not given a timetable for the introduction of the qualified adult allowance payments up to the full rate of the non-contributory State pension but it is important that a woman has a pension in her own right.  Many women gave up work outside the home but worked twice as hard in the home for years rearing children and looking after older relatives.  Ireland has changed and both parents now must work to keep a roof over their heads.  Individualisation encouraged that system.  Some people ask if that is the best for society.</P>
        <P>Widows and widowers need support but I do not know if the Minister has considered making the household benefits package available to widows over a certain age who might find it difficult to find employment.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed that the budget and the Social Welfare Bill do not mention support for young carers.  There are 3,000 of them in the State.  The Minister implied that I asked for them to get the carer&rsquo;s allowance but that is not the case, I asked that other support be made available to them.  Ministers promised they would discuss this but these young people are out there and their schooling, social lives and entire childhoods are suffering while the Government is doing nothing to address this issue.  It is not that it has not been alerted &mdash; I do not know how many times I have asked questions about it &mdash; but nothing has been done for young carers.</P>
        <P>Young carers must help a parent or sibling in intimate tasks, such as feeding, washing or cloth<Col N="756"/>ing, then go to school, where they worry about the parent at home, and then go home and do this work again.  I do not know whether somebody comes in during the day, but the Carers Association says 3,000 young carers are affected.  I would like the Minister to outline a strategy for them.  The Minister might say this will be part of the carers strategy, which will be brought forward later in the year, but nothing has happened in the two years I have debated this issue and I do not know why, given that the Minister has acknowledged the issue should be addressed.  Perhaps he will outline why they are being ignored.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a national waste waiver scheme is another issue not covered by this legislation and it may not be covered by the Bill the Minister proposes to introduce next year.  Every local authority does its own thing, depending on its budget but a number do not operate a waiver scheme.  The cost of the disposal of household waste is impacting on older people and social welfare recipients.  While this does not fall strictly within the remit of the Department, it should be addressed.</P>
        <P>Many social welfare recipients on housing estates depend on oil heating and they receive a once off oil fill to do them for most of the year.  I am not sure whether the Minister has ever considered a bulk payment of the fuel allowance rather than a weekly payment to help them pay in one go.  Officials might say it should be paid weekly rather than in one lump sum because otherwise the recipient could blow the money on a holiday or something else.  However, this is not a total nanny State and, therefore, if a social welfare recipient would like the fuel allowance up front to pay for an oil fill, it should be examined.  I do not know whether this has happened in the past and there might be an administrative issue, but I hope the Minister will examine the possibilities in this regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome the changes to the farm assist scheme and I am pleased many farmers will have an opportunity to improve their pension entitlements, as requested by the IFA and others.  The Bill has a great deal going for it as a significant amount is being given away to social welfare recipients.  The job is not complete, however, and much more needs to be done.  Payments must be focused where they are needed and a good start has been made with the operation of the CDA in particular.  The Minister must move beyond that to provide a targeted, automatic payment to recipients and poverty traps must be avoided.</P>
        <P>During his budget speech, the Minister referred to lone parents and the cohabitation rule, about which he has been talking for some time.  When will proposals be brought before the House to make amendments in this regard?  Will they be introduced in the Bill the Minister proposes to bring forward in February or will it be left until after the election?  The major problem faced by <Col N="757"/>lone parents is the cost and availability of child care, which prevents them from joining the workforce as they need also child care before and after school as well during school holidays.  I was approached recently by a lone parent who wants to return to work.  She has two girls aged nine and ten but she wanted to know who would mind her children when they are off school.</P>
        <P>The cost and availability of housing is not covered by the legislation but it impacts significantly on social welfare recipients.  They pay huge rents to private landlords.  While the rental accommodation scheme has been introduced, it is not working.  Its implementation has been extremely slow because property is not available to the standard required.  This is a worry because that implies people are living in substandard housing throughout the State.</P>
        <P>All of us are worried by the levels of personal borrowing and indebtedness.  The Minister has quite rightly expressed alarm and concern about people who borrow money at exorbitant rates from licensed moneylenders.  This demonstrates the pressure people are under and in the current era major expectations and pressures are placed on parents with children.  Children go to school and if one of their class mates has bought expensive new trainers or a school bag, they want the same.  Parents want to do the best they can for their children as a result.  I commend the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other voluntary organisations on their work and on the millions of euro they spend to alleviate hardship and poverty.</P>
        <P>Moneylending and debt is a problem.  The Minister is probably the happiest ever holder of his office because of all the money he can give away but the underlying structural issues, which are still causing problems, must be examined.  Imagination and vision are required to tackle them.  Community welfare officers are in the front line trying to address hardship.  They make exceptional needs and other payments to people under serious pressure.  We have all been visited by such people in our clinics.  However, the Government proposes to transfer community welfare officers from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I am not sure how much debate has taken place on this proposal but the Government should not tamper with their role without great care and thought because they are at the coalface dealing with dire problems.</P>
        <P>I welcome the improvements in the legislation and the many increases that people deserve.  I look forward hopefully to being on the Government benches this time next year when we will be in a position to do more for them.  In the meantime, I thank the Minister for what he has done to date.  His predecessor introduced 16 savage cutbacks and we have all worked hard to reverse them.  The Minister has done a great deal in this regard but more remains to be done.  As Jesus <Col N="758"/>once said, &ldquo;The poor will always be with you&rdquo; and we will have to do our best for them.  Every Member is committed to doing the best he or she can for people who need support and help.  I ask the Minister to examine the relative income poverty model, which deals with the significant gap between those who have a great deal and those who have very little.  Consistent poverty remains, although a great deal of progress has been made.  Relative income poverty is beginning to surface and cause problems.  The Minister has had his head in the sand in this regard for a long time.  He has been in denial, saying this is not the way to consider poverty.  He says he has solved the problem because consistent poverty has almost been tackled.</P>
        <P>Significant issues related to indebtedness, credit and borrowing are being driven by relative income poverty and this must be tackled.</P>
        <P>It is getting late and I think I have said enough so I will hand over to Deputy Penrose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to contribute to this debate on social welfare on behalf of the Labour Party.  I thank the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, for allowing his officials give us some very useful information on the Bill earlier today and I thank those officials for their diligence and courtesy in taking us through the legislation.  </P>
        <P>I always try to be constructive and when I express a view, it is a fundamentally held belief, rather than something put forward for the purpose of disagreement or antagonism.  The Labour Party feels that at times of great economic prosperity wealth should be shared generously with those most in need.  I am chairperson of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and we wrote the report on carers ourselves, without input from consultants, over six or seven months down in the bunker.  I wrote the part referring to the need for recognition and acknowledgement.  The first thing consultants do is charge a fee for hours worked and a lesson we learned from the report, which I advise the Minister to heed, is to forget about such input and instead put ordinary people, Deputies and Senators in those bunkers to create reports.  They meet real people every Friday, Saturday and Sunday in their clinics and know what is going on.</P>
        <P>Theory should be done without as it has led the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, into a notorious mess relating to payment for the provision of nursing home care.  I predict that the Minister, Deputy Harney, will sink without trace as a result of the move made yesterday which has taken the gloss off the budget.  It may not have a major effect in Dublin, but in rural areas there is a great deal of dissatisfaction relating to the new scheme on payment for nursing home care.  I met a man last night aged 76 who was very happy with the budget. <Col N="759"/> However, he said he worked for 46 years to build up his house and would like to leave it to his daughter without a legacy of debt.  For this reason, he said he hopes he never has to go into a nursing home.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, will force people to make decisions that they should never have to make.  I am not here to take the gloss off the budget, but remember the words I have spoken tonight.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, on this, his third budget, and the significant effort he has made to deal with some of the issues we have brought to his attention over the years.  The Minister has gone some way in improving the lot of the poor and disadvantaged, a process that began in the budget of 2004 and continued in 2005.  However, I disagree fundamentally with the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s assertion in his Budget Statement that throughout its term in office the Government has assured the less well off have shared in Ireland&rsquo;s growing economic prosperity.  That is an effort to rewrite history.  If the current Minister for Finance has forgotten the dreadful years of the regressive McCreevy budgets, the savage 16 and other insidious cuts, none of the disadvantaged, nor the groups who support them, have forgotten.</P>
        <P>From 1997 to 2004, the gap between rich and poor widened as each of seven successive budgets gave to the rich and took from the poor, making Ireland one of the most unequal countries in Europe.  As the Conference of Religious of Ireland, CORI, put it in 2004, the same year they were taken to Inchydoney to manufacture a Pauline conversion, &ldquo;the rich get richer while those living in poverty still have a long way to go before they ever reach the poverty line of income&rdquo;.   That is taken from page 41 of the Priorities for Fairness &mdash; Socio-Economic Review 2004 by the CORI Justice Commission in case anyone should accuse me of being political.  Two recent budgets giving more to the poor than the rich can only go a small way towards putting right the neglect of the previous seven years and we await the outcome of the most recent budget.</P>
        <P>I would also question the real meaning of the boast by the Minister for Finance that in this budget he is providing &ldquo;the biggest package of support for those on low incomes in the history of the State&rdquo;.  There are two very clear reasons for this large package, both arising from this Government&rsquo;s mismanagement of the State&rsquo;s finances.  First, as outlined above, the Government increased income inequality and worsened the situation for the poor over the first seven years of its time in office.  It will take more than two or three years of higher spending on social welfare to put right the damage done over so many years.  Second, a recent economic commentator has put our current inflation rate at 4%.  We <Col N="760"/>have not done nearly as well as our EU neighbours in keeping inflation under control although we are facing the same international problems with rising energy prices and the fall in the value of the dollar.</P>
        <P>With significant inflation, the Government will obviously spend more in absolute terms just to buy the same amount of goods and services this year as last year.  Any Minister for Finance presiding over an economy with significant inflation can always make the very hollow boast that he is spending more than he ever did before, but this is not the same as devoting more resources to the needy.  Indeed, the Government, during its entire time in office, has never spent as large a proportion of the country&rsquo;s total income on social welfare as the rainbow coalition did in 1995 and 1996, when social welfare expenditure accounted for 10.4% to 11.1% of the gross national product, GNP.  The advent of the current Government led to social welfare expenditure falling as low as 7.5% of GNP and it has remained in single figures throughout its time in power.  I have taken these figures from page 85 of the Central Statistics Office Statistical Yearbook of Ireland 2006.</P>
        <P>Those struggling on inadequate social welfare incomes are very sensitive to every price increase, whether caused by general price inflation, stealth taxes or Government agreed increases in gas, electricity, transport and health care costs.  Real improvements in circumstances are important to the disadvantaged, not comparisons and changes relating only to the previous year&rsquo;s financial circumstances.</P>
        <P>The great cheer during the budget speech from Fianna F&aacute;il Party backbenchers at some social welfare payments at last crossing the &euro;200 per week barrier gave a clear indication that it is perceived that helping the poor might improve the party&rsquo;s prospects in the next election and that any social welfare payment of &euro;200 per week solves all the problems of low income groups.  Neither of these assumptions is justified.</P>
        <P>As far as the election is concerned, let us wait for the results.  As far as the increase in social welfare payment is concerned, have any of us in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann tried to live on &euro;200 per week and face the price increases that inevitably come?  It is, I think, unlikely.  Yet the cheers from Fianna F&aacute;il Party backbenchers at having reached this boundary for some social welfare recipients shows how little those in power know about the realities of life on the bread line.</P>
        <P>In fact, the minimum weekly disposable income required to avoid poverty in 2006 is &euro;203 for one adult, &euro;270 for one adult and one child and &euro;337 for two adults.  The source for these statistics is again CORI, page 23 of a report entitled, Justice: Developing a Fairer Ireland 2006.  Thus, even before the first instalment of these new improved payments has been made, the unemployed, widows and widowers under 65, lone parents, the <Col N="761"/>disabled, carers and many other groups will be below the poverty line.</P>
        <P>Before looking at some cases in detail I must say a few words about poverty in general.  We are all getting tired of the way in which the Government and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, refuse to accept the fact that Ireland has poverty levels which are far too high.  Instead they criticise and try to rubbish the statistics presented as being out of date, irrelevant to Irish conditions or unfair comparisons.  Let me make it clear that all the references to poverty made by me today are taken from the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s most recent publication on poverty, dated 16 November 2006.  The CSO refers to some of the Laeken indicators, agreed by Ireland and all other EU countries in 2001 as the most appropriate methods of measuring social inclusion and of comparing the effectiveness with which different EU countries handle problems of social inclusion and poverty.  These statistics show that Ireland has the highest poverty levels of any country in the EU except Portugal and the Slovak Republic.</P>
        <P>Ireland is far less effective than other EU countries in reducing poverty levels through social transfers.  Our total transfer system only reduces poverty by 18%, compared to the EU average of 25%.  The unemployed, one parent families, the ill and disabled and the elderly have very high poverty levels, while a very worrying feature is that in Ireland up to one third of all children live in poverty.</P>
        <P>I am tired of the Government closing its eyes to the real and deep seated problems of poverty in Ireland and either criticising the statistics, as if this were just a theoretical game, or trying to pretend that just one year&rsquo;s budget change can put everything right.  If the Government refuses to accept the EU&rsquo;s official comparisons outlined above, it must, surely, believe the experience of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other charitable organisations.  In the last year SVP spent more than &euro;41 million giving direct help to more than 300,000 families that had been let down by the Government&rsquo;s social support system.  Some &euro;7.5 million of this figure was emergency support for families who had no money, no food and no resources, &euro;4.6 million was allocated for food and &euro;3.1 million for fuel.  It is clear that fuel poverty is a big issue, and spending has been doubled in this regard in recent years, but the level of support should rise to approximately &euro;25 over an extended period because it is a real issue throughout the country.  Elderly people tend to be frugal in their budgets and often turn the heat off in their homes to save money.  It is sad that people have to scrape together a few bob in this way.</P>
        <P>If life is as good as the Government would have us believe, why do members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul stand outside churches to collect <Col N="762"/>the &euro;41 million the society needs to rescue people?  As Professor John Monahan once said, our ultimate aim should be to put the Society of St. Vincent de Paul out of existence.  The society spent &euro;1 million on reconnecting families to gas and electricity supplies and, in light of the continuing increases in fuel bills, pleaded with the Government for a weekly fuel allowance of &euro;24 between September and April.  However, the budget provides a mere &euro;18 per week.  More help is required if ill, disabled and elderly people and families with young children, all of whom remain at risk of poverty, are to keep warm and prepare hot food.</P>
        <P>In 2002, there were 154,000 lone-parent families in Ireland, which represented about one sixth of all families, and one in three births took place outside marriage.  Approximately 80,000 lone parents, or just over half the total number, received a one-parent family payment, which has been increased in this budget to &euro;207.80.  However, the minimum disposable income needed by one adult and one child to avoid poverty is &euro;270, so one-parent families will start the new year below the poverty line.</P>
        <P>What has happened to the proposals on lone parents which the Minister for Social and Family Affairs published earlier this year?  Genuine concerns were expressed that elements of the proposals could result in new poverty traps.  All proposals must be poverty proofed so as to ensure they do not make people worse off.  There was a failure to ensure adequate access to education, which is the best route out of poverty, and appropriate child care.  Nevertheless, there was considerable merit in the Minister&rsquo;s proposals, particularly in terms of the abolition of the long outdated prohibition on cohabitation.  It is time we got over the idea that being a parent is somehow a problem and addressed the farcical barrier that prevents lone parents from entering long-term relationships for fear of losing their incomes.</P>
        <P>One-parent families are now a significant feature of our social system and they deserve better from this year&rsquo;s budget increases than being left on the breadline.  The problems they face in terms of caring for their children while trying to find suitable employment are exacerbated by Ireland&rsquo;s high child care costs and the absence of free child care provided by the State.  This budget contributed little to child care and the issue remains a stumbling block for many people across the country.  The exorbitant cost of child care is preventing many people from reaching their full potential by preventing them from working outside the home.  The State must intervene to provide more child care places.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance spoke eloquently about the national disability strategy and his intention to continue the rate of expenditure provided for in last year&rsquo;s budget.  He failed to mention that the State&rsquo;s support for the disabled <Col N="763"/>started from a very low base.  A report published in September by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions stated that, compared with the European average of 2.2%, at 0.8% Ireland spends the smallest proportion of GDP on disability benefit in Europe.  While there are some problems in terms of comparing across countries, a deficit as large as ours will not be overcome by a couple of years of increased expenditure.  The report also found that the guidance and counselling services necessary for those claiming sickness and disability benefit to return to work are less accessible in Ireland than elsewhere.  The right to work is as fundamental to disabled people as it is to the able bodied.  Some 8.3% of the population are disabled but only 14.7% of those who can work are employed.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs recently received a submission from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland.  Multiple sclerosis, which affects 7,000 people in Ireland, is the most common disabling neurological disorder among young people, although it can occur at any age.  Among the issues raised by the society was the necessity for the Government to provide a costed disability benefit.  It is widely recognised that the daily cost of living for people with disabilities is higher than for the general public and many disabled people experience a lower standard of living as a result of their disabilities.  Among the many areas of increased cost are transport needs, housing adaptations, disability aids and appliances, heating, care assistants and home helps.  In 2005, a report from the Department of Social and Family Affairs indicated that 66.5% of people receiving disability payments fell below the 60% level of median income and 22.5% suffered basic deprivation.  Current research indicates that people with disabilities are less likely to be in paid employment.  A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, therefore, often means the end of paid employment.  A costed disability payment should be carefully considered in the context of introducing equality to the system.</P>
        <P>Ireland has approximately 149,000 carers, of whom one third spend more than 43 unpaid hours per week looking after elderly, frail or otherwise disabled relatives and friends.  Nearly half of all carers have no paid employment but, whether in work or school, in their middle years or elderly, they sacrifice their time to care for others in their homes.  They do not generally choose this role but are forced into it by family circumstances.  There is strong evidence that carers suffer from stress and poor health because of the difficult 24-hour nature of their role.  The NESF has calculated that all the unpaid care provided by carers in Ireland saves the Exchequer up to &euro;2 billion per year.  Unfortunately, the Government is not keen to repay carers for their vital and dedicated work. <Col N="764"/> Less than one fifth of all carers receive any direct financial support from the State.  The measures on increased respite care and additional payments are therefore welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know a woman over the age of 66 who looks after her old-age pensioner husband.  She could have received the qualified adult dependant benefit but opted for the carer's allowance because it was financially preferable.  Is she now entitled to the qualified adult dependant payment?  For reasons of equity, I submit that she is entitled to receive that payment at half rate.  I ask the Minister to investigate the matter.</P>
        <P>Carer&rsquo;s allowance and other State supports for the disabled and carers rely on a variety of complex means tests administered by different State agencies.  Apart from the demeaning nature of such tests, transparency is so lacking that few can make their way through the associated labyrinth of rules and regulations.  Despite the Minister&rsquo;s claim that the budget offers great support for the disadvantaged, all carers receive is an increase in the carer&rsquo;s allowance to &euro;200 for those aged under 66 and to &euro;218 for those over 66.  This leaves carers under the age of 66 below the poverty line of &euro;203.</P>
        <P>The Minister has made only minor improvements to other Government aids for carers.  In 2003, the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs undertook a detailed study of carers and their problems.  It was the committee&rsquo;s unanimous conclusion that all carers needed help and that the carer&rsquo;s allowance should no longer be means tested but should be made available to all carers.  More benefits are means tested in Ireland than in any other EU country, yet international evidence shows that means testing leads to high administrative costs and poor social provision.  The Labour Party, therefore, continues to support the provision of a universal carer&rsquo;s allowance.  In 2003, the estimated cost was &euro;180 million.  That was probably an over-estimate, as it did not calculate the reduction in administrative costs which universalism brings.</P>
        <P>The Government pandered to the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; right-wing ideology in the recent budget by unnecessarily giving away &euro;186 million in reducing the top rate of income tax from 42% to 41%.  I will benefit from the reduction, but why should I?  It would be much fairer and more socially just for Fianna F&aacute;il, which occasionally claims to be socialist, to use this money to universalise the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  In that way, the money would end up in the hands of those who really need it.  Such people clearly deserve recognition and support for looking after people and saving the Government up to &euro;2 billion.  That is where the money should be spent.  The &euro;150 million could be used to eliminate the need for the degrading means test.</P>
        <P>The Minister might ask me whether, as a member of the Labour Party, I have gone mad.  I <Col N="765"/>have not gone a bit mad.  One&rsquo;s child is entitled to free primary school education in this country even if one is earning &euro;1 million a week.  The children of the very rich have such entitlements.  A person over the age of 70 who gets a pension of &euro;10,000 every week is entitled to a free medical card.  Why should people who provide essential services be penalised for exceeding the means test limit by just &euro;2, &euro;3 or &euro;10?  The proposals regarding nursing home care which have been made by the Minister, Deputy Harney, are the worst I have seen for a long time.  People will eventually be forced to sell their homes, through no fault of their own, even after they have left this life.  It is an attack on the elderly.</P>
        <P>If the Government were to abolish the means test, it would deal with this issue immediately.  Many people would become even more encouraged to look after elderly people.  As Deputy Stanton said, it has been proven in every country in the world that people are far happier in their home environment.  He mentioned the wrap-around care system in Denmark, under which psychological services and care packages are provided.  In Denmark, all kinds of services, such as rehabilitation services, are made available to the elderly as soon as anything happens.  This proposal will put the heart crossways in older citizens who are feeling unwell.  We should remember that we all will reach that stage at some time.</P>
        <P>I reject any proposal to include the family home in any means test.  The family home is not used to calculate means for any other services, such as medical cards, pensions and third level grants.  Why should an exception be made in the case of elderly people who are too sick to stay at home?  Old people are being singled out.  It seems that their homes will eventually be sold to pay for their nursing home bills.  If the Labour Party gets into government, it will set about overturning this measure.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs can beat us to it by abolishing the means test.  Such a move would send an important signal.  It could be an important step for the Government.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge what the Minister is doing in section 12.  I applaud him for this very good initiative.  He might not think it is important.  Section 12 provides that certain self-employed people in receipt of social welfare payments who are not entitled to credited contributions, such as farm assist and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, can pay PRSI contributions.  It is an extremely important measure, even if he does not think it is.</P>
        <P>We will have to do something about the averaging system.  We start off on the day the ball is thrown in, there is a big gap in the middle and then comes the tail.  It is a disaster.  It is time to change the law to allow the spouses of farmers and other self-employed persons to make voluntary PRSI contributions so they can qualify for pensions in their own right.  The Minister has <Col N="766"/>admitted to me that the spouses of employed or self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from social insurance contributions in respect of their working activity with their spouses.  Such spouses are effectively forgotten.  They are invisible in the social welfare code.  They spend many hours at the shoulders of their spouses trying to retain and build up businesses.  They work extremely hard from morning to night.</P>
        <P>Many of the people to whom I refer are shopkeepers in rural areas &mdash; I am sure it is the same in Dublin &mdash; who get up at 7 a.m. and work until 9 p.m. to provide a service that many of the whizz-kid supermarkets do not provide.  Such people, who comprise an important part of Irish society, are being let go.  Many of them will end up poverty-stricken.  They might have an old building, but that is all they will have at the end of their time.  The same can be said about farmers.  This anomaly in the social welfare code relates to the spouses of farmers and shop owners, as well as people in other self-employed categories.  Women who are classified as &ldquo;relative assistant&rdquo; and are prevented from paying PRSI cannot qualify for contributory pensions in their own right.  If they work a certain number of hours in the shop or on the farm, they should be allowed to pay a PRSI contribution on a voluntary basis, as is the case with carers.  It is time for this matter to be reviewed.  A submission should be made and examined in this context.</P>
        <P>I now turn to an issue of real concern to me and my Labour Party colleagues.  It has been partially addressed by the Minister.  Having raised the matter in this House, I have to take some credit for driving it this far.  While the Minister does not tend to show much of a reaction, he is keen to listen to us.  He gets somebody to examine the matters we raise, which shows he is fairly shrewd.  I suppose accountants tend to have more guile than more robust people like us who are from rural areas.  I am speaking about the modernisation of the social welfare system, which is full of outdated and outmoded concepts.  When I spoke previously about this matter in the D&aacute;il, I received e-mails from men saying I must be the most anti-man person who ever went into this House.  While I am not anti-man, I hate inequity and inequality.  I love to see it rooted out, wherever it is.</P>
        <P>As someone who is proud to represent the Labour Party in this House, I want the 1920s and 1930s social welfare model to be overturned and reformed because it contains outdated and outmoded concepts.  In so far as the model relates to eligibility and assessment, it tends to relegate women to roles within the system which are subservient to the roles of men.  I highlighted an example of that when I spoke about the spouses of farmers and shopkeepers.  Those who are set apart in the social welfare code are virtually not recognised.  We have to bring an end to such con<Col N="767"/>cepts, in the interests of equality, equity and fair play.</P>
        <P>Members should not doubt that the Labour Party wholeheartedly promotes and supports economic independence for women.  If we are to achieve this worthwhile and noble objective, we must agree unequivocally to abolish the limitation rule for all payments.  We should not fiddle around with it &mdash; we should abolish it.  The Progressive Democrats are looking to waste money by giving people like me an additional &euro;20 per week, but they should keep that money and use it to bring equity to the system.  They might not be interested in that, however.  I almost forgot that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a promoter of inequality, so what am I talking about?  I was a bit of a clown to mention it.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to increase the rate of all qualified adult payments to 100% of the rate of the personal payments and to make them directly payable.  While he is starting to do that, he is not doing them all together.  He is going a bit of the way.  I suppose he has been in politics long enough to understand that the foot in the door is a good start.  I acknowledge that.  Women are the qualified adults in many households.  It is sometimes the case that there is no economic benefit to the household if both adults receive an individual payment.  In the cases of the majority of qualified adults, their payments go directly to their husbands, which is wrong.  They should get payments in their own right.  If a woman&rsquo;s payment is given directly to her husband, it takes away from her economic independence and excludes her from receiving any payments in her own right.</P>
        <P>As the Minister has said previously, the only way for him to address this situation is to ensure that qualified adult payments are paid directly to the qualified adults.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s move in the direction of abolishing the limitation rule.  We must bear in mind that 95% of qualified adults are women, many of whom are excluded from the labour market because of their caring and parental roles, to which Deputy Stanton referred.  The Government gave a commitment in Sustaining Progress to increase the qualified adult payment to 100% of the full person&rsquo;s payment by 2007.  That commitment will not be honoured, however.  The timescale for the achievement of this worthy and important objective has been long-fingered.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is alarmed at the Government&rsquo;s proposal to subsume the community welfare service into the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The service, which caters for the most vulnerable people in our society and operates at the cutting edge of the link between health and poverty, should be left where it is, within the health service.  If it is not broken, why <Col N="768"/>should it be fixed?  This is little more than a craftily disguised cutback and an attack on vulnerable people in the community.  This plan, which is being pushed by one or two people &mdash; I know who they are &mdash; is provided for in the Bill.  The Minister should take advice from a fool by throwing this aspect of the Bill into the bin.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>If the plan proceeds, community welfare officers will ultimately be reined in and prevented from providing information, advice and advocacy to vulnerable people in our communities.  It would mean in effect that the most effective link that such people have to statutory health and personal social services would be severed.  This is because the people whom community welfare officers serve, including those with addictions, those with mental health problems, abuse victims and people with chronic social, behavioural and psychological issues, are far more likely to access health and personal social services through the community welfare system than through formal channels because the possibility of discretionary community welfare payments provides an incentive, allows CWOs to make needs assessments and puts them in touch with appropriate health services.  If the Minister allows this to go ahead, he will run an unacceptably high risk of breaking the link between payments and access to health services which will be severed over time, if not very quickly.  That is because the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be reluctant to fund functions for which it has no statutory responsibility.  That is the point.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy is based on the report of the interdepartmental review group on the core functions of the health service report, which recommended the transfer.  There is no difficulty with the objective of focusing the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s resources and activities on core health functions but the community welfare service performs a core function.</P>
        <P>Our former leader, the late Frank Cluskey, on introducing the scheme stated it was more than a mere cash response.  The service was deliberately placed within the community care structure and under the auspices of the Department of Health with the intention of delivering a local response to individual need and, crucially, providing its clients with access to a range of health and personal social services.  The importance of the relationship between income maintenance and effective personal and health services, as well as a safety net separate from other social welfare payments, was clearly and specifically identified in the D&aacute;il debates as what led to the establishment of the services.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister not to do this.  With the exception of that, he has done a reasonably good job and I hope he takes note of the various points and suggestions I made which will get us further <Col N="769"/>down the road to ensuring poverty will be a bygone in time to come.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for not being able to attend the briefing on the Bill the Minister kindly organised this year, as in other years.  It was due entirely to a scheduling difficulty on my part.  I value such briefings and I would have appreciated it again this year.  Nevertheless, I got the gist of what the Minister was proposing last Wednesday although there may be clarifications in my contribution to which he may care to respond when replying to the debate.</P>
        <P>Opposition spokespersons are not here to bury the Minister but to praise him and to take into account much of what he has achieved in improving the standard of payments across the board.  Our role as Opposition spokespersons comes into play because the Minister&rsquo;s artistry, like that of most of us, is born out of an industriousness rather than a sublime talent.  He probably believed too readily the writing on the paint tin given to him by the Minister for Finance which stated that a guaranteed velvet texture can be applied to any surface.  In reality, while he has managed to paint the wall, there are significant lumpy bits and the paint peels in the strangest of places.</P>
        <P>As we critically examine the current social welfare system, it is valid to ask why the opportunity was not taken to correct many of the anomalies that continue to exist.  There is no doubt the level of payments have been increased significantly but the categories of payments, the inconsistencies in such payments and the degrees of unfairness that exist for different categories of people who do not qualify for many of those payments are the real remit of any Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  This Bill, and the Social Welfare Bills in January and February, provide an opportunity to address those anomalies.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Government made great play about the fact that the contributory State pension has exceeded the &euro;200 benchmark they set out, just as they made great play about the &pound;100 benchmark at the end of their first term of Government.  While there have been large increases in the State pension and massive progress has been made, when one compares a percentage of the average income here with that in other developed countries, Ireland continues to lag considerably behind.</P>
        <P>Despite the benchmark the Government must address immediately the partnership commitment <Col N="770"/>to have the State pension at one third of average pension levels and the possibility of further increases in future budgets to help bring that about.  In percentage terms, that figure is only half the amount on which people in other developed countries are living.  We must debate the reason that is the case.</P>
        <P>Deputy Stanton said we already spend more in tax forgone in giving support to private pensions.  In my other role as finance spokesperson in the small party I represent, I asked the Minister&rsquo;s Cabinet colleague about the restriction last year regarding the &euro;5 million limit on private pension personal plans.  A total of 116 individuals managed to get under that limit last year.  One individual managed to acquire a personal pension plan of more than &euro;20 million which the State was subsidising at a rate of 42%.</P>
        <P>What is the state of our pension policy when, on the one hand, we forgo more in tax from the richest individuals while, on the other, we make a song and dance about large increases which effectively could be doubled if we did not have a tax subsidy on private pensions?  That is inconsistent and it is unfair on pensioners who have built up this country to the position it enjoys today.  Unless we have an honest debate on pensions at that level, these &euro;20 increases will be seen historically as a missed opportunity because the likelihood is the economic circumstances in which we found ourselves in the past ten to 15 years will not exist to the same extent in the next 15 to 20 years.  We must have the vision to ensure those benchmarks can be reached in the future.</P>
        <P>What is also curious about the Minister&rsquo;s current policy is that he mentioned the Government&rsquo;s commitment to making qualified adults in receipt of the State pension or the qualified dependants of State pension recipients equal to those at the non-contributory level.  I accept the higher increases will allow that to happen but the fact that those on the non-contributory pension will receive a higher increase than those on the contributory pension indicates there appears to be a policy, which has yet to be stated &mdash; if it exists the Minister might enlighten us &mdash; about overall individualisation.  Is it a fact that the gap between the non-contributory and the contributory pension is narrowing while at the same time the qualified adult allowance level is meeting the non-contributory level?  Has some new figure to be reached at a date the Minister has decided not to tell us about?  If that is the way the State policy is going, we must have that debate as well.</P>
        <P>If that is the policy, it contradicts the way the Minister is treating the same issue in respect of other social welfare payments.  For instance, the State pension for qualified adults over 66 will increase by X amount but the increase is less for those under 66.  That is reversed in respect of other social welfare payments, particularly with regard to carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Why are carers over <Col N="771"/>the age of 66 getting a smaller increase than those under 66, especially when the representative organisations like the Carer&rsquo;s Association tell us that 50% of all carers are over 60 years of age?  The likelihood is that the proportion of people who will be disadvantaged by the smaller increase are the majority of carers.  Has the Minster&rsquo;s Department done any analysis of that figure?  What is the reason for that distinction which appears to be at variance with what the Minister is trying to achieve in the general pensions area?  In terms of all other social welfare payments, the way qualified adults are being treated means that gap will widen.  We appear to have three distinct strands in regard to payment policy and the way qualified adults are treated.</P>
        <P>Deputy Penrose is right.  The opportunity existed in this budget to get rid of the limitation rule.  At a stroke that would have abolished discrimination against the greater number of our citizens dependent on social welfare, including women affected by the socially disgraceful marriage code that existed until the early 1970s.  Those people, who are becoming grandparents, are being adversely affected by those employment practices, by the State itself and by other large institutions such as banks. Until the Minister begins to recognise that anomaly, budgets which provide that the system stays the same but the benefit payments improve will not continue to keep the masses happy.  Our system is creaking.  It is a contradictory system that is in need of large-scale change.  I would like the Minister to address that in his reply having regard to the opportunity that will be presented by the second Social Welfare Bill that will be introduced early in the new year.</P>
<HtmlBk SectId="7" />
        <P>The PRSI changes and the threshold applying to health insurance assist minimum wage earners, but this represents merely a widening of the band.  In effect, the Department will end up receiving more money.  Increasing it at the higher income end of the scale in terms of the interest that PRSI is charged at means more money will come into the Department.  The same is true of the health levy, especially with the proposal for higher income earners.</P>
        <P>The Minister might explain the changes in regard to the optical benefits.  There does not seem to be a parallel change such as there seems to be in the case of PRSI benefit.  Is the Minister providing in the Bill that the lower limit in regard to optical benefit will remain unchanged, and if so, why is that anomaly being created?</P>
        <P>The health levy is a flat rate tax on people&rsquo;s gross income, regardless of the fact that a higher charge will apply to people earning more than &euro;100,000 per annum, about which I will not squeal even though it will affect most Members in this Chamber.  The Minister&rsquo;s Cabinet colleague speaks against the idea of hypothecated taxes, <Col N="772"/>that taxes can be raised for specific purpose and used for that purpose, particularly in the area of the environment.  Yet the health levy is meant to pay for some of the heath service inadequacies in terms of ongoing funding.  Other members of the Government seem to deal more in hypothetical taxes but I do not want to bring the T&aacute;naiste into this debate at this time.</P>
        <P>This Bill will not be opposed by any Member of this House but in this context more imagination and efforts to introduce reforms are required.  If that is evident in the second Social Welfare Bill, there will be more support in this respect from this side of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>This year and for the past eight years the Government has had at its disposal an unprecedented surplus.  It had, if it really wanted, an opportunity to transform the Ireland in which we live.  My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, argued that this year, in view of the unprecedented surplus in our economy, a historic and golden opportunity had been presented where quite literally and with the right political will, we had a real opportunity to lift children and their families out of poverty.  An opportunity that no other generation had has been wasted.</P>
        <P>Last week&rsquo;s budget regrettably continued down the well worn path of the well-off being rewarded at the expense of those on low and middle incomes.  A fair and equitable redistribution of wealth failed to take place and a budget was delivered that will further exacerbate the gulf between the rich and the poor in today&rsquo;s society.</P>
        <P>The fact remains that not everyone responsible for our economic growth is benefiting from it.  Many people are being left further behind.  By reducing the higher rate of tax by 1% down to 41%, the Government took a decision to once again reward those who have done well, making them even more well off, while ensuring that those on low incomes will continue to struggle to make ends meet.  The tax reduction removed &euro;186 million from State resources, money that could have transformed the lives of many people who live on the margins of society.  For the same amount of money, the Government could have increased the State pension by &euro;34.80 per week, with plenty of change left over.  The fact the Minister, Deputy Cowen, choose to reward the well-off over the interests of the aged, struggling to cope on their pension, clearly reflects the Government&rsquo;s priorities.</P>
        <P>Some 18.5% of the population in this State are at risk of poverty and 7% live in consistent poverty and suffer deprivation.  Some 40% of lone parents are at risk of poverty while a similar number of unemployed endure poverty.  These are among the highest poverty figures in the European Union in a so-called first world or developed country.  I share the growing viewpoint that economic success should not be an end in <Col N="773"/>itself but should create the conditions or be the launching pad to ensure that everyone has a decent standard of living.  Some 100,000 children live in poverty.  That is not a made up figure but comes from the Government&rsquo;s statistics.  It is an appalling indictment of a Government obsessed with producing the inequities of wealth while turning a blind eye to exploitation, literally turning its back on and ignoring the vulnerable the most marginalised in our society.</P>
        <P>As a society, we are continually peddled the image of success.  New millionaires, we are told, are being made every day in this new Ireland.  We are told that more money in one&rsquo;s pocket will solve everything, but it does not.  If we want a first class health service, someone must pay for it.  If we want a first class public transport service, it must be funded.  If we want our homeless off the streets, we must build accommodation for them.  If we want young people from the most marginalised of society to stay in school, we need to create the places and the necessary supports for them.  If we want people to move from welfare to work, we need to support and create a safety net for that transition.</P>
        <P>We are told by those in the leadership of one party in Government that inequities are necessary and even help drive the economy.  However, for many of us and particularly those from my political background, the reality of any child, Irish or non-Irish, having had his or her life crushed and strangled by poverty while surrounded by enormous wealth is an abomination.</P>
        <P>Children in some of the poorest one-parent families will benefit from the budget changes but not to the extent the Minister implied in an earlier speech.  The increases will be seen by many as nothing more than a token gesture and will not be effective in tackling or removing any child from abject poverty.</P>
        <P>The majority of the &euro;20 increase in the lone parent allowance will be swallowed up by rising fuel and food costs.  While Ministers continue to pat themselves on the back for their budget efforts, the reality is that trying to raise, feed and clothe a child and put them through school on &euro;185.80 a week is no easy task.  While I welcome the increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, it must increase further to reflect the true costs of sending children to school.  I am also conscious of the low take-up rates of this payment and others such as family income supplement mean many of the families most in need fail to receive those vital reliefs.</P>
        <P>Ireland is one of the most unequal societies in the world.  The top 10% of earners have incomes on average five times greater than the bottom 10%.  The foundation blocks of the Celtic tiger were created by the hard work of ordinary workers, a significant proportion of whom are now pensioners.  The proposed increase in State pensions will ensure that many of those elderly <Col N="774"/>people will remain in or on the edge of poverty.  Electricity and gas price increases will ensure that social welfare increases are swallowed up, preventing people on low incomes from adequately heating their homes.</P>
        <P>Some 44,000 families are on local authority housing lists, thousands of families cannot afford to purchase homes and more than 5,000 people are homeless.  This budget has done little to ease their plight.  To meet the NESC&rsquo;s recommendation of 10,000 social housing units per annum, Government expenditure would have to be increased to &euro;2 billion.  With an increase of just over &euro;100 million in the budget, total Government output still lags behind the target of &euro;1.27 billion.  The 10% of households in this State living in private rented accommodation were ignored in the budget, as increases in tax relief for private renters were miserly.</P>
        <P>There has still been no dedicated effort to improve affordable high quality child care throughout the State.  Families are still obliged to fork out more than &euro;800 per month per child on child care costs and have to use child benefit to subsidise such costs.  The &euro;1,000 early child care supplement covers only a month an half of child care costs.  This was another missed opportunity to reduce the economic burden on young families.</P>
        <P>Some 30% of adults who have only primary level education are at risk of poverty, one in three children in a disadvantaged area cannot read and write properly and 1,000 children fail to make the transition from primary to secondary school each year.  This budget has done little to address the inequalities in the State and is a long way from securing Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s vision of an Ireland of equals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  The Social Welfare Bill 2006 gives effect to the social welfare changes announced in last week&rsquo;s Budget Statement.  Reading through the budget, there were signs that the Minister listened to representations made in the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  I spent some time on that committee and I must say that I enjoyed it.  I regretted leaving it, because we were dealing with real life issues on an ongoing basis.  In contrast to some of my contributions on Social Welfare Bills in recent years, I must concede that the social welfare package was one of the more welcome aspects of this year&rsquo;s budget.  Few people realise that the Department of Social and Family Affairs is the biggest spending Department and it was heartening to see Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy welcome the budget&rsquo;s provisions in this area.  However, many people depend on social welfare and it is our job to find weaknesses in the budget.</P>
        <P>Social welfare changes are normally calculated to ease the pain and make life a little more bear<Col N="775"/>able for the most socially deprived people in our society.  The question is how they measure up in the task of bridging the poverty gap between the most disadvantaged and the most privileged.  It has been acknowledged that the gap has widened because of the 1% cut in the higher level of income tax, which for the most part benefits the better off.  This includes Members of the House and people on a reasonably comfortable salary.  It is ironic that we are giving out about such a decrease in the tax take.  We also note that the increased non-contributory old age pension, which has hit the &euro;200 barrier for the first time and which raised a chorus of war-whoops from the Government benches, is still &euro;3.50 below the poverty line.  We should acknowledge that and not jump out of our skins.  Is it fair that pensions are linked to the poverty gap?  The contributory old age pension, at &euro;209.30, is just  &euro;6 above the poverty level, and clearly shows that we have a long way to go to eradicate poverty.</P>
        <P>One yardstick by which to measure both the ongoing and the cumulative effects of successive budgets on the lives of the poor is the list of figures quoted by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Calls to the society have quadrupled over the past three years, and it needs to spend over &euro;750,000 each week to relieve both poverty and social exclusion.  It is ironic that calls have quadrupled during a period in which three of our better social welfare budgets have been introduced.  There are many people out there whose pride will not allow them to call the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  These people would rather keep the struggle indoors than hurt their pride, so I am not sure whether we are getting the full picture of what is happening out there.  Older people often want to keep a few euro for their funeral and for the relatives who have looked after them.  This fear of dying in poverty is in the psyche and some people will not spend money on themselves, no matter what is given to them.  People want to keep that little bit of their &euro;200 in reserve because they are afraid of the rainy day.</P>
        <P>The annual spend by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul of more than &euro;39 million dampens the Celtic tiger&rsquo;s roar, and many of those who found it necessary to contact the society for help were in poorly paid jobs.  Their low levels of income rendered them ineligible to qualify for any social welfare benefits.</P>
        <P>Pensioners have been playing catch-up over the past three budgets from a very low base, and it is disturbing to note that our old age pension is still bottom of the EU heap, fifth from bottom of the OECD countries.  To bring old age pensions up to an acceptable European level, they would need to be increased by at least &euro;50 to take them clear of the poverty threshold.  However, their increases will also come under severe pressure from increases in electricity, gas and medical bills, <Col N="776"/>or merely trying to stay warm.  They pay the same price as the rest of us for gas, electricity and even bread, but if gas goes up by 33%, it eats much more into their income.  Inevitably, these problems hit in the middle of winter when people are more likely to suffer from hypothermia.  We have been told for the past two or three years that the country has been awash with cash, so it is mystifying to consider why pensions and State payments have not been adjusted to a more realistic level before now.</P>
        <P>A key group likely to be caught in poverty traps is that of lone parents, whose child dependant allowance, targeted at children in poverty, has not increased in 12 years.  Overall, the social welfare package is to be given a guarded welcome, but to state that it completely tackles the issue of poverty is somewhat wide of the mark.  We must admit that a bit has been done, while the Government must admit that there is much more to do.</P>
        <P>A couple of years ago, the ESRI stated that any dent in the relative income poverty levels in this country would require a 9% rise in income tax.  That would not be welcome in many quarters.  Although we have high employment and average income has risen dramatically in recent years, the number falling below 50% of the average income is still well above the EU average.  The ESRI stated that a successful anti-poverty policy would need improved education, greater employment opportunities and better income support.  Many teenagers are leaving school without sitting their leaving certificate examinations.  One must be educated to get into the skilled labour force.  The onus is on us as a society to ensure that happens.  There are many well educated people in Europe and we could be displaced if education is not kept to the fore.  The budget could have made a more targeted approach to help those in need, particularly families on social welfare and those in lower paid employment.</P>
        <P>Childhood food poverty needs to be tackled, particularly in the area of inequality.  Food and poverty are intrinsically linked and we know that families on low incomes have low consumption levels of fresh fruit and vegetables.  Fruit is often seen as a treat for these people.  They also tend to consume more foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar, putting them at risk of a poor diet, with children being the most vulnerable.  Parents, however, are not to blame, since diets are strongly influenced by people&rsquo;s social and environmental circumstances.  Low income is a major factor in this mix.  Parents play a key role in providing for their children&rsquo;s diet, and it is important they are supported through social welfare initiatives that would improve availability and access to healthy and affordable food.  There is a growing awareness of food poverty as a structural constraint of food consumption and dietary intake, particularly among low income groups. <Col N="777"/> Food poverty has multi-faceted consequences for health, education and social partnership, and there is considerable scope for the Government to eradicate it.</P>
        <P>The commitment to end homelessness by 2010 sounds like a pipe-dream.  It is somewhat reminiscent of the boast by the Soviet Union that it had abolished poverty when people were begging for bread outside Russian Orthodox churches.  I must mention to the next homeless person I meet that he or she has only another four years to go before the problems are sorted out.  The &euro;20 increase in social welfare rates is to be welcomed, but it provides cold comfort for those on the streets without a roof over their heads.  The attitude prevails that they are victims of their own circumstances, but I do not believe that, rather they are victims of society&rsquo;s circumstances and we have to take it on ourselves to sort this out.  Their Christmas will be spent trying to ensure they have hostel accommodation.</P>
        <P>The measures announced for family carers in the home, while welcome, will only deliver for them a modicum of support and certainly do not go far enough to have real impact.  There are 150,000 family carers in the country and the increase in allowance will provide a degree of support for them.  Ireland&rsquo;s family carers provided over 3.5 million hours in unpaid care every week.  They are the unsung heroes and heroines of family care.  I come across the fraught situation on a regular basis where old people are expected to look after even older people and not enough recognition is being given to them.</P>

        <P>First, I want to refer to the Minister.  We are all entitled to our politics across the floor, but I believe we all agree this Minister is revolutionising social welfare and taking on reforms that many of his predecessors in successive Governments over the years did not, or would not do.  We should applaud the work of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and encourage him to carry on that work.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not just saying this because it is Christmas, but I have often applauded the efforts of Deputy Penrose, who is <Col N="778"/>Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  The Minister will know that he gives members of that committee the opportunity to voice their concerns.  At a parliamentary party meeting last week, I said that not only is the Minister listening to Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, but indeed he listens to members at meetings of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs also.  Deputy Stanton will nod his approval at that because I believe the Minister is listening. </P>

	<P>Colleagues are entitled to their politics and I have no problem with that, except to say that I have been listening to all the speeches, including the recent contributions tonight.  While Members make their political points, they are being honest enough to say that this has been a good, caring budget and that the job is being done.  My colleague, Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe, said the other day that this budget is all give and no take, with which I believe everyone in the House will agree.  That is fair enough.  The Minister&rsquo;s stamp is clearly on what is before the House and I am happy to compliment him in that regard. </P>
        <P>The question of the challenge of carers is something that has been talked about a good deal at the joint committee meetings.  I frequently make the point that all of us have had opportunities within our families to observe difficulties in that regard.  I often speak of my father, who before he died ten years ago was cared for by my sister.  Such a role presents many challenges and it is right to highlight the needs of carers whenever possible.  I believe the Minister has listened and the reforms he has introduced will go a long way to helping families that are affected.  As the saying goes, much done, more to do.  We should continue to do what we can for carers and the public will be very much in favour of that.</P>
        <P>I was not going to talk about my constituency.  Some Members will know I represent Dublin South-West, which includes Tallaght, the third largest centre of population in the country.  It also includes communities in Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills as well as in rural areas such as Bohernabreena and Brittas.  I read in a newspaper this evening that someone claimed not to have seen me in a while.  I have walked the streets of my constituency, week in and week out, and certainly over the past week or so I have visited every part and have been listening to what people are saying about the budget.  Whether Members agree, people are responding positively to what was done, particularly as regards social welfare.</P>
        <P>At a time when the economy is doing so well, as everyone admits, we must remember that as all craft rise the smaller boats must not be forgotten.  The Taoiseach has often reminded us about this and it is something I do.  I always recall learning <Col N="779"/>from my Tallaght-based predecessor, former Deputy Chris Flood who, as everyone will agree, put his stamp on the social inclusion ethos and got the message across both within our party and in the House.  We all want to ensure that the small boats are helped.  In many of the measures introduced by the Minister, he has had a clear focus on the people in need.</P>
        <P>We are all keen that the fuel and energy challenges faced by many families are met.  I am from a bygone Dublin era.  When I was small, I lived around here, funnily enough, and I recall people having difficulties and challenges with fuel and energy.  That seemed to abate over the years as my life developed.  Now there are challenges again and I am glad the Government has taken account of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the weak spot in the budget.  The Deputy should not go down that road. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall have to await the Official Report to find out what the Deputy is saying since I am trying to get through my few minutes and let my colleague, Deputy Johnny Brady, make his contribution.  The Minister must realise there are difficulties among families as regards energy and fuel.  I am glad he has been able to do something in that regard and that he has been progressive. I hope he will continue to do that.</P>
        <P>I also want to raise the question of disability benefits.  Again, we all listen to the various representations and submissions we receive from many organisations.  We must be careful not to patronise such groups, but at the same time we have to understand that people want us to look after those who are disabled in our communities.  The Minister has done that in successive budgets.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will continue to do what it has always done and look after that sector.</P>
        <P>I support also what has been said about homelessness.  One must be careful what one says.  I heard Deputy Connolly refer to this, using his political perspective, and that is all right, but I hope the Government and the Department of Social and Family Affairs will continue to give every benefit available to those who look after people who are homeless.  I have often spoken, for example, about Tallaght.  People who are homeless there find they must leave on the bus for town to access services.  That is something that must be looked at by the agencies.  Clearly, the HSE in this case has a particular role to play.  Tallaght is no worse than any other place, but where people have such difficulties and need accommodation and assistance, we should provide services for them as far as is possible without them having to get a bus to access services.  At a time when the agencies have funds, we should encourage them to use those moneys <Col N="780"/>wisely so that effective use is made of resources and people are not homeless.</P>
        <P>This could be done in Tallaght or anywhere else.  There is no harm in continuing to raise this point because people should not be homeless in this day and age.  They should be able to avail of resources, such as hostels or temporary accommodation.  Members should be creating a situation in which people do not live on the streets.</P>
        <P>At a recent Oireachtas joint committee meeting, I commented that people should not be poor when the economy is thriving and there is so much money in the system.  I am glad the Minister has taken particular account of the need to deal with child poverty.  Many projects in my constituency are funded by the Department and other agencies.  This should continue and at a time when moneys are available, we should use the resources to help those groups in need.</P>
        <P>As I noted earlier, as the Minister is aware, there will never be enough done and there will always be work to do.  However, in respect of this debate, he can be proud of his achievements.  My Opposition colleagues may make political points, which is fair enough.</P>

People talk to Members, who come to the House from their constituencies in Cork, the midlands, Kildare, Meath, or Tallaght to represent their cases.  All Members do so skilfully.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I welcome this Bill.  It is a key part of the 2007 budget package, which, according to the ESRI, boosted overall household income by approximately &euro;2.6 billion per year.  The ESRI has indicated this was one of the most progressive budget packages in the past decade and a half.  Poorer families gained substantially more in percentage terms than those at the middle and top of the income distribution.  On average, the poorest one fifth of families gained close to 5% more from budget 2007 than they would have done from a neutral budget.  In contrast, the gain for the top one fifth of families was 1%.  While the cut in the top tax rate attracted attention, the sharp increases in welfare payment rates have given a greater boost to the incomes of poorer households.</P>
        <P>This year&rsquo;s budget will see a rise of almost 5% in the incomes of the poorest one fifth of families.  This rise has only been exceeded by budget 2006, when the large early child care subsidy gave rise to a particularly strong percentage increase in the incomes of low earners.  When the incomes of low-income earners are growing faster than their high-income counterparts, the share of income going to low-income groups is rising and their incomes are rising in respect of average income.</P>
        <P>This Social Welfare Bill will begin to put into effect the largest ever welfare budget package of &euro;1.4 billion.  This means the Government will spend almost &euro;15 billion on social welfare in 2007.  This is welcome expenditure that will make a great difference to many people&rsquo;s lives.  The generous provisions include an increase of &euro;20 for more than 565,000 recipients of lower welfare rates.  It also delivers on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to bring State pensions to &euro;200 per week, with the contributory pension increasing to more than &euro;209 while an increase of &euro;18 raises the non-contributory pension to &euro;200.  In total, more than 400,000 pensioners will benefit from the increases.</P>
        <P>Overall, these substantial increases, which represent rises of up to three times the expected rate <Col N="782"/>of inflation, will directly benefit some 1 million people, including pensioners, low income and welfare families, carers and those with disabilities.  When their dependants are included, a total of more than 1.5 million men, women and children will benefit.</P>
        <P>I also want to congratulate the Minister on many features of the welfare package, which include a number of significant fundamental reforms of social policy shaped and targeted directly at tackling remaining child poverty numbers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Santa is coming early.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;supporting carers through increased incomes and supports, increasing the status and incomes of women pensioners and enhancing the incomes of older people.</P>
        <P>The Minister has often expressed his concern about child poverty, which I welcome.  I also welcome that he is acting on his concern.  Specific reform measures, backed up by substantial budget investments, include combining three levels of child dependant allowances payments into a new single high rate qualified child allowance of &euro;22 per week, in addition to the child benefit increase of &euro;10, for more than 340,000 children of welfare families.  A second tier of payment for children in low income and welfare families could be a very effective method of tackling child poverty.  This improved and targeted child dependant allowance represents a substantial move in that direction and this is why the budget is focusing on increased child supports in this area.</P>
        <P>Increasing the income threshold for family income supplement by up to &euro;185 per week will add from &euro;9 to &euro;111 to the weekly income of families that receive support for employees on low income with children.  A 50% increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will increase the lower rate for children aged two to 11 years by &euro;60 to &euro;180, and the high rate for children aged 12 to 22 years by &euro;95 to &euro;285.  An estimated 172,000 children will benefit from the allowance in 2006.  Raising the allocation for the school meals scheme by &euro;3 million to more than &euro;16 million will allow for an expansion in the number of schools participating.  Undoubtedly, the Government is acting to help the worse off.</P>
        <P>As for carers, I am delighted by the introduction for the first time of an entitlement to retain a full social welfare payment, which abolishes the rule that forbids two welfare payments, and in addition to receive up to a half-rate carers allowance.  This is a real recognition of older people&rsquo;s caring duties.  Under this new dual payment system, the Government will start to recognise the carers allowance as a support for caring duties, rather than as a welfare payment.  I congratulate the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, on this reform.  It is an <Col N="783"/>important step forward and I welcome his determination to press ahead with other needed reforms in the caring area.  Other excellent social welfare measures in the budget include an increase in the respite care grant by &euro;300 to &euro;1,500.  This will benefit almost 40,000 carers.</P>
        <P>My constituents in Kells and Oldcastle, or the new areas of north Westmeath such as Castlepollard, Delvin, Collinstown, Fore, Clonmellon or Drumcree, have complimented the Minister fully.  I again compliment him on his actions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Deputies Penrose and Paul McGrath will wish Deputy Brady well in his new constituency.  Of course it is an area which is loyal to the three of us.  Its people have put us here.  He will continue the good work for the area, for which the three of us have been working so hard and where we have seen such changes in our time in this House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have never seen such radical changes as those which occurred over the past number of years.  Gone are the bad old days when one got an increase of &pound;1.50 in social welfare.  Now there are increases three times the rate of inflation, as has been stated here this evening.</P>
        <P>Much hard work has been done on behalf of the carers by Deputy Penrose, and by Deputy McGrath, who is an expert in financial matters and deputy spokesperson for his party, to advise and assist the Minister, Deputy Brennan.  He is a caring Minister who has brought in many serious reforms.  Not since the days of Charles Haughey have we seen such serious reforming in the House to benefit the underprivileged and those most in need.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the increase in allowances for senior citizens to over the &euro;200 threshold that was promised in the programme for Government and in the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto.  I welcome all of the increases related to child care.  I welcome the additional &euro;4 in the fuel allowance, which will increase from &euro;14 to &euro;18.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the weak spot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the &euro;300 increase in the respite care grant.</P>
        <P>I welcome the back to school allowance increases.  Little was said about the back to school allowance, but this is a serious effort involving a substantial increase and I wholeheartedly welcome it.  I say well done to the Minister on this 50% increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which increases the low rate for children aged two to 11 by &euro;60 to &euro;180 and the rate for children aged 12 to 22 from &euro;95 to <Col N="784"/>&euro;285.  An estimated 172,000 children will benefit from these allowances in the coming year.</P>
        <P>I want to say to the Minister and to the Government that we have seen bad times in this House in our privileged term as Members.  I never thought we would see the day where there would be such expenditure on those most in need.  We all know of constituents who come into our clinics making heartbreaking pleas that something be done and to intercede.  Thankfully, this year&rsquo;s budget, under my neighbouring constituency colleague and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, must be acknowledged and welcomed, and they must be congratulated, by all sides of the House.  As one who is here for quite a long time, I certainly do so here tonight.  I look forward, with the help of God, to many more budgets in this particular vein, and especially for those on lower incomes who have been quite rightly uplifted over the past two or three budgets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the House on the Social Welfare Bill.  As the officials who have heard me on many occasions are gathered here tonight again, a certain amount of my thunder has been stolen because the Minister on this occasion has managed to unify the child dependant allowance into one payment of &euro;22 per week.  It is a matter on which I used to rant and rave over a long period of time.  Lo and behold, when I stand up today I nearly have nothing to say but will find something nonetheless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McGrath is happy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be difficult for the poor Minister, Deputy Brennan, to come in here and have all this kudos heaped upon him.  I could remind the Minister that a few years ago the esteemed Ceann Comhairle and former Deputy, Se&aacute;n Treacy, was a bit surprised when he was stepping down and glowing tributes were paid to him from all sides of the House because the kind of bouquets thrown at him previously would not have been similar.  When the speeches came to an end, he drew himself up to full height in his Chair and stated that, on listening to everybody in the House, he thought he must have passed away and had to kick himself to be assured he was still alive and able to hear what was been said.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Brennan, is wondering what has happened.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the single rate of child dependant allowance because many others acknowledged there was a gross injustice to some children who were discriminated against simply because of the category of social welfare payment their parents were receiving.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P>I will perhaps embarrass the Minister further.  It is not the first time I have seen Deputy Brennan do something that was against the run of play.  In the short time he was Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan sorted out an extremely difficult problem in my constituency with a contentious issue on which others had turned their back.  It is not new that he would take steps like that and I applaud him.</P>
        <P>That said, we on this side of the House welcome generally the measures in the Social Welfare Bill.  We have a job to do as well.  We must point out where we are going, where the next steps should be taken and what are the next areas to be addressed and examined.  It is in that context that I will put a few points to the Minister.  I am, of course, confident that Deputy Brennan will not be able to deal with these problems because he will have moved to this side of the House, but perhaps Deputy Penrose, Deputy Stanton or somebody else will be the Minister capable of implementing the reforms of which I will speak.</P>
        <P>The first such reform, which is along the same lines as that of the child dependant allowance, relates to child benefit.  There is a gross inequity in child benefit.  The rate is &euro;180 for the first and second child, and there is a much higher rate for subsequent children.  That is not fair.  Why should one discriminate against the third child?  The ridiculous situation arises where when the first child getting a particular rate, the Department does not know what rate to give the twins who follow and, therefore, divides it between them so that they get a rate half-way between the rates applicable for a second child and a third child.  The same level of payment for child benefit should apply across the board.  There should not be different rates for first, second and third children.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Minister managed to introduce a second tier of payments, to which he and others made reference.  We need this second tier of payments whereby people on lower incomes will qualify for a higher rate of child benefit.  It is important to go down that road and take a step towards working in that direction.  I hope whoever is Minister on the next occasion &mdash; it will not be me &mdash; will start down that road.</P>
        <P>The second issue I ask the Minister, or whoever will be the incumbent after the election, to examine is the terrible and grossly wrong discrepancy between long-term and short-term payments and the consequences flowing from being on one rather than the other.  For example, a person on a long-term payment is entitled to the Christmas bonus whereas a person on the short-term payment is not.  Unemployment benefit is a stamps-related payment.  It is an insurance scheme into which one pays.  When a person needs to draw unemployment benefit, he or she is entitled to draw down the stamps.  A person who draws down his or her stamps does not get the <Col N="786"/>Christmas bonus.  By comparison, a person on unemployment assistance, who perhaps does not have the same level of stamps, whose stamps are old or who does not have the same contributions, gets the Christmas bonus.  That is not fair.</P>
        <P>To project that further to the children of those on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit who attend third level, where a child attends third level a parent on the long-term payment will get the dependant allowance but a parent on the short-term payment will not.  That is not fair.  The Minister is discriminating against those who have contributed to the social welfare fund and who are in their time of need.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A further disadvantage arises in the case of the higher education grant top-up for those on low incomes.  If one is in receipt of unemployment benefit, which is stamp-related, and one&rsquo;s child is in higher education, one is not entitled to the top-up payment.  However, if one is in receipt of unemployment assistance, which is not stamp-related, and one&rsquo;s child is in higher education, one is entitled to the top-up payment.</P>

	<P>I do not intend to delay the House, other than to inquire with the HSE, via the Department of Health and Children, when the doctor on call scheme will be extended to all parts of County Louth.  Many parts of the country now have this excellent service and where it is available, the service has enhanced patient care considerably.  The elderly living in isolated areas have particularly benefited from the availability of doctors on a round the clock, seven days a week basis.</P>
        <P>While the range of services provided for care in the community has grown significantly, there are pockets where the doctor on call scheme is not available.  There may be local reasons and justifications for this or there may be no justifications for its not being available.  County Louth has experienced a rapid population growth in the past five or six years as a result of the upturn in the economy and every part of the county needs a doctor on call service.</P>
        <P>When the doctor on call service is available in other parts of the country, the pressure on accident and emergency departments is considerably reduced.  The need for people to be rushed to hospital because of the unavailability of a doctor often means that family members must provide the transport.  In turn, this brings people into accident and emergency departments who should be dealt with in a home setting.  There is a clear need <Col N="787"/>to accelerate efforts to put in place a full doctor on call scheme countrywide.</P>
        <P>My interest tonight is parochial and relates to County Louth.  When can we expect to have a comprehensive doctor on call service available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of GP out of hours co-operatives throughout the country is an essential part of our health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that, to the greatest extent possible, care needs are met in the primary care setting.  Out of hours co-operatives allow general practitioners to put in place arrangements to provide services to their patients while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, at weekends and on public holidays.  These co-operatives offer responsive, high quality services, which are delivered by on duty doctors, nurses and secretarial staff in well equipped, modern clinical centres.  The service can be accessed through a single lo-call telephone number in each region.</P>
        <P>Organised co-operatives enable general practitioners to manage the provision of urgently needed care in a way that affords them reasonable off duty arrangements.  This is an important resource which helps to maintain and sustain GP services provided by single-handed doctors and other smaller practices in rural and deprived urban areas.  Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive areas providing coverage in all, or in part of all, counties.</P>
        <P>Between 2000 and 2005, my Department allocated approximately &euro;105 million to the HSE for out of hours GP co-operatives.  Almost &euro;34 million is available to the executive for these services in 2006.  In 2007, a further &euro;3 million has been allocated to meet the full-year cost of co-operative developments commenced in 2006.</P>
        <P>North-eastern doctor on call, NEDOC, is a partnership between the HSE and participating general practices in the north east.  There are 48 GPs with general medical service contracts in County Louth and 21 of these participate in the co-operative.  NEDOC provides out of hours services to patients of participating practices from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m., Monday to Friday, and around the clock at weekends and on public holidays.  The service was established in September 2000 and more than 400,000 care interactions have been provided to date.  A recent patient satisfaction survey recorded extremely high satisfaction levels, with 96% of respondents saying they were satisfied with the service.  Between 2000 and 2006, more than &euro;15 million was allocated to the former North Eastern Health Board and the HSE for the expansion of the out of hours co-operative in the north-eastern area.  This dedicated funding does not include fees paid to participating practitioners for attending patients.</P><Col N="788"/>
        <P>There are four main treatment centres in NEDOC based in Castleblayney, Cavan, Drogheda and Navan.  There are also ten peripheral centres where GPs can arrange to meet patients nearer to their homes when required.  I have been advised by the HSE that the Dundalk area is not covered by NEDOC as the majority of GPs practising there have declined to join the NEDOC co-operative.  There is also an insufficient number of GPs willing to participate in the co-operative to enable the executive to establish a treatment centre in Dundalk.</P>
        <P>There is no contractual obligation on GPs to participate in these co-operatives and these GPs are providing out of hours cover to their public patients through agreed rota arrangements in accordance with their GMS contracts.  The HSE has confirmed that it will continue to work towards the extension of the GP out of hours co-operative to all GP practices in the north east and, in particular, that it will continue to actively pursue the establishment of a NEDOC treatment centre for the Dundalk area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting debate on this important issue and the Minister of State for coming here to reply to it.  The issue relates to the need for the Minister for Education and Science to announce immediate funding so that the go-ahead may be given to the extension at St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Virginia.</P>
        <P>The town of Virginia has dramatically increased in size over the past few years.  Many of its new inhabitants have bought houses there and work in Dublin.  It is bad enough for them that the M3 has not been built, but the fact that their children, and the children of families who have lived in Virginia all their lives, have no acceptable school accommodation is deplorable.</P>
        <P>The existing school was built for approximately 190 pupils and there are 315 pupils on the roll today.  There are seven teachers working in prefabs where they teach approximately 150 pupils.  There is no longer a computer room or library.  There is no storage for all the resources needed to fully implement what the principal accepts is a wonderful new child-friendly curriculum.  The principal has no office and has to use part of an old building, while 17 female teachers are using a single toilet.  The rental of prefabs for the past two years was &euro;90,000 and at best will cost a minimum of &euro;360,000 before a new school can be finalised.</P>
        <P>If ever there was an example of failed consultation between the housing section in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and our education system, this is it.  Surely we must not just plan for houses, but at <Col N="789"/>the same time for services such as schools.  It is totally unacceptable that no senior Department official has stood on the site since the application for an extension consisting of four classrooms and three ancillary rooms was made in April 2004.  While I appreciate that I received a commitment from senior Department officials on Monday that every effort is being made to assess projected needs to bring us up to 2011, it is difficult to explain to parents, teachers and management why the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has not assured more progress on such a critical issue.</P>
        <P>The management team met the Minister in June 2005 and it is still awaiting progress.  I ask the Minister of State to make sure that the assessments are finished before the end of the year so that it is included in the new year programme as an urgent and emergency need.  I hope that by the end of January the Minister for Education and Science will be in a position to allow her Department to bring this to the planning stage.</P>
        <P>I compliment the parents&rsquo; association, management, principal, teachers and all the staff for the delivery of an excellent service in an extremely difficult situation.  It creates difficulties for teachers and pupils, both in class and at play, but it is clearly even more difficult for children needing resource-remedial or other support teaching.  It is difficult to teach normal-sized classes in such accommodation but it is impossible when five of the classes have over 30 pupils and three have over 35.</P>
        <P>This school has a waiting list for some of its classes.  Some 49% of the pupils from first to sixth class have joined after junior infants, highlighting the influx of new people to the area.  Of course, they came as a result of the increased housing, which itself came as a result of planning.  Situations such as this should be dealt with in advance and planning taken into account by our education system.</P>
        <P>The people of Virginia have the proud record of providing their own secondary school in very difficult times, when the State had no money.  It is unacceptable that, with the State coffers bulging to the extent the T&aacute;naiste says there is no need for all the taxes, teachers and children should have to survive in such structures.  It is difficult to explain to the farming community and small shop owners how health and safety considerations can be ignored by the Department of Education and Science when they are subject to such on-the-spot inspections under the guise of so-called EU regulations.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, was at the meeting last night, as was Deputy Connolly.  We saw at first hand the seriousness of the situation.  The school does not even have computers, which is not the way young children should be taught in this day and age.  I urge him to bring a message to the Minister that this is an urgent crisis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item for debate.  As Deputy Crawford said, we and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, attended a meeting last night at St. Mary&rsquo;s school, Virginia. It was a very well-attended meeting and was very constructive.  The parents&rsquo; committee had briefed us exceptionally well and handled the meeting well.</P>
        <P>Deputy Crawford, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith and I made a promise to work as a team for the people of Virginia.  I am sure other Oireachtas colleagues will join with us, so that it will not be allowed to become a political football.  There was much debate about how the school had arrived at the situation in which it finds itself.  A decision was made that that was historical and we had moved forward.  The view of the meeting was that we should consider what is to happen in the future.  There are reasons why the situation has got to where it is, such as the increase in population at a rate much more rapid than anybody had anticipated, the increase in new house building and poor planning by departments who did not interact and apply joined-up thinking.  Difficulties that had arisen with the school were outlined and people were unhappy with the way the pupil-teacher ratio had been calculated.  The school was regarded as having a ratio of 1:24 but in reality it is 1:29.  With such a ratio the school would be entitled to an extra teacher.  Not only were teachers taking classes but classroom assistants were brought in to make the picture look different.  There are five classes with more than 30 pupils and three with 34 or more.  Reference was made to the aeroplane seats into which the children were crammed, which is not a good teaching environment, whatever one might be teaching, as it is claustrophobic.  The school was built for 190 pupils but there are now nearly twice as many.</P>
        <P>Mention was also made of the external facilities, such as the way the portakabins took up the children&rsquo;s play space and the fact that the school faced a busy road.  The primary schoolchildren can climb on to the wall, leading to a situation where three members of staff feel they must, for safety reasons, patrol the school yard daily, whereas in most schools one suffices.</P>
        <P>It was also revealed that there was one toilet for 17 female staff, which presents health and safety difficulties and would not be accepted in any private industry, never mind in a public institution, which is supposed to be the upholder of such standards.</P>
        <P>The collection and dropping off of children also causes difficulties.  Approximately 90% of the children must cross the road at some time, because most live on the far side from the school.  There is no school crossing, although Cavan County Council advanced many reasons why that <Col N="791"/>had to be so.  It was suggested that primary school students be trained to teach the younger children how to cross roads.  That is fine if a lollipop man or woman is there to supervise the training programme, but that is not the case and the issue needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>One of the big issues to arise during the night was the assessment process.  It was generally known by all present that the Minister had sent an official to examine the case in May 2005.  How much time does it take to assess a problem as obvious as children having to attend a cramped school which cannot accommodate its students?  Everyone knows that Virginia is a growing commuter town of Dublin.  A better road structure will be delivered in the near future and the school has a fair argument.</P>
        <P>I wish I could share the optimism of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, who said the assessment would be finished by late January or early February, when he appeared to expect positive news.  I hope the Minister of State can add to that this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank both Deputies for raising these matters as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and, in particular, to outline the position regarding the proposed building project for St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Virginia and the situation relating to its staffing levels.  It is good to see two Deputies from the same constituency working together as a team.  I wish them well in their efforts.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools, as well as responding to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a major priority for the Government.  Since taking office, this Government has shown focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>As evidence of this commitment, approximately 1,300 building and modernisation projects are active in our primary and post-primary schools during 2006.  This year alone some &euro;500 million is being spent on primary and post-primary projects throughout the country, compared to approx &euro;90 million in 1997.  Indeed, funding has progressively been increased in recent years with an aggregate total of over &euro;2 billion between 2000 and 2005 and a commitment to invest a further &euro;3.9 billion up to 2010.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputies will agree that this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to ensuring that school accommodation is of the highest standard possible.  On top of this, to <Col N="792"/>reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have also been developed for 8- and 16-classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and to save on design fees.  The design and build method is also used to expedite delivery where the use of standard designs is not possible.  Taken together with the unprecedented level of funding available, these initiatives ensure that building projects are delivered within the fastest timeframe possible.</P>
        <P>St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Virginia is a co-educational primary school with a current enrolment of 309 pupils.  In recent years an upward trend in enrolment at the school has necessitated a review by the Department of housing developments, demographic trends and enrolment trends in the area to ensure that any capital funding provided will deliver accommodation appropriate to the school&rsquo;s need into the future.  On completion of this assessment, a decision will be taken by the Department and conveyed to the school on how best to provide for the school&rsquo;s long-term accommodation needs.  A site visit will be required to inform the final brief for the project and the Department will be in contact with the school authority to arrange this at the appropriate time.  Following the site visit, the brief will be completed and the project will be considered for progress in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2007 onwards.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that school building projects are selected by the Department for inclusion in a capital programme on the basis of priority of need presenting, which is determined by published prioritisation criteria formulated following consultation with the education partners.  The application of these criteria to capital funding submissions and the publication of the school building programme ensure that maximum openness and transparency applies to the school building and modernisation programme.  Most importantly, this approach ensures that all schools applying for capital funding can know how their applications will be treated and when they are likely to progress.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the school&rsquo;s enrolment figures on 30 September of the previous year.  The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule that is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners.  The staffing schedule is set out in a circular that issues from the Department to all primary school boards of management.  Accordingly, all boards are aware of the staffing position for their schools in any school year.</P>
        <P>The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils <Col N="793"/>in the school.  Schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios, with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on.  Next year, this ratio will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>On 30 September 2005, St. Mary&rsquo;s national school had an enrolment of 278 pupils, which warrants a staffing for the 2006-07 school year of a principal and ten mainstream teachers.  The school also has the services of one permanent learning support-resource teacher and one temporary language support teacher.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools, there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  A developing school is defined as a school where the enrolment on 30 September of one year is projected to exceed the enrolment of 30 September of the previous year by a specified minimum numerical increase and by having an excess of five pupils above the required appointment figure.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform this House that one such developing school post was sanctioned by the Department at St. Mary&rsquo;s national school for the 2006-07 school year based on an enrolment of 309 pupils.  In the circumstances, the Department is satisfied that the school&rsquo;s staffing levels are consistent with its needs and nationally agreed protocols.  I assure both Deputies that the Department is anxious to move ahead with the school&rsquo;s building project and every effort will be made to finalise an accommodation brief so that the project can move to the next stage.</P>

      <sTitle>Landslides Prevention.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for this opportunity.  I also thank the staff of the House and the Minister of State for staying late to hear what I have to say.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the Minister of State has been in the town of Cobh.  If not, I invite him to visit.  The town is built on a series of hills and, consequently, is susceptible to landslides.  In the past 25 years, the town council has raised with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the potential danger to human life caused by landslides.  To be fair, the Department has provided funding to Cobh Town Council to repair damage caused by landslides and to carry out works to stabilise slopes.  While these substantial and recent works were funded 100% by the Department, a number of areas continue to give rise to concern.</P>
        <P>In 2005, JODA Engineering Consultants prepared a report outlining some of the areas where it was believed that further work was necessary.  The report has been forwarded to the Depart<Col N="794"/>ment&rsquo;s officials.  The town council understands that the opinion of the Department is that a full review of the landslide programme must be carried out before further funding can be sanctioned by the Department of Finance.  While the council has no difficulties with a review of that nature, serious concerns have been expressed that it may give rise to a delay in dealing with the issues raised in the JODA report.  The report identifies a number of locations where work is urgently needed, including Harbour Terrace, Harbour Road, Connolly Street and a number of smaller projects.  Many of the necessary works have been costed and requests for sanction to carry them out have been submitted to the Department.</P>
        <P>Since the report&rsquo;s completion, two further areas have experienced landslides.  On 18 November, a serious landslide occurred on West View, resulting in the closure of the public road.  JODA has reported to the council regarding the danger of further landslides with the potential to affect the safety of persons and property, including a number of houses.  The council has also been advised of a rockfall on the grounds of Belview national school, giving rise to concerns about the safety of the children attending the school.  It should be noted that neither West View nor Belview was prioritised by JODA in its report.</P>
        <P>On foot of representations by concerned residents, members of Cobh Town Council have consistently raised this issue at council meetings.  Councillor Paddy Whitty rang me this morning as I made my way here.  Councillors are aware that a landslide in 1980 resulted in the tragic death of a child and are concerned that a similar occurrence is possible.</P>
        <P>I do not know what is in the Minister of State&rsquo;s prepared script, but I ask that he take the matter seriously and ask the Department&rsquo;s officials to examine the case of Cobh.  Having heard what I have said, he would agree that the matter needs urgent attention before a serious landslide resulting in injury or death occurs.  We want to avoid such a situation if possible.  Owing to the recent heavy rains, the issue is even more urgent because they can lead to further landslides, as the Minister of State knows.  We have experienced tragedies in the past and I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to prioritise this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter.  I am standing in for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.</P>
        <P>The urban area of Cobh is unique in terms of its geological and structural problems.  The geology of the area is limestone shale, which has become unstable in certain areas following excavation and weathering.  This instability has been exacerbated by the manner in which Cobh <Col N="795"/>developed, particularly in the 19th century.  As a result of the construction of the naval dockyard and supply port at Haulbowline, the population of the town grew from a few hundred at the beginning of the 1800s to 7,000 by 1837.  Demand for accommodation meant that hillsides were excavated to create building space and access roads.  This activity resulted in steep slope faces and rock faces of up to 90 degrees behind houses.  The excavated stone was used to construct the houses, roads and retaining walls.  Those retaining walls were generally substandard.</P>
        <P>Following a fatality caused by a landslide in 1980, the Department has given considerable financial assistance towards remedial works undertaken by Cobh Town Council to strengthen areas susceptible to landslides.  The assistance takes the form of 100% grants subject to prior approval of the remedial works by the Department.  Since 1980, grants of more than &euro;4 million have been paid to Cobh Town Council.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that while the Minister shares his concern about the situation in Cobh, he must also be satisfied that works to be undertaken from public funds are cost effective and properly prioritised.  The existing Department of Finance sanction allows the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to recoup expenditure to a limit of &euro;4,285,366.</P><Col N="796"/>
        <P>As there has been an ongoing programme of works during almost a quarter of a century, periodic review is important.  It is now desirable to quantify the number of projects left to be completed, the estimated completion date and the potential final cost.  Cork County Council will take the lead in this review.  I understand that a draft brief for the engagement of a specialist adviser in connection with the review has been endorsed by the Department subject to some adjustments.  Cork County Council has also been advised that if it is of the opinion that immediate remedial works are essential in the interest of public safety, the Department is prepared to consider a proposal from it.</P>
        <P>Cork County Council is free to commit its own resources to meet such works as it considers necessary.  In this regard, the Minister has announced increased local government fund allocations of almost &euro;948 million in general purpose grants to all local authorities, including Cork County Council and Cobh Town Council.  Next year, Cork County Council will receive &euro;54.8 million from the fund, an increase of more than<?oasys _jy ?>6%, while Cobh Town Council will receive more than &euro;1.3 million, up almost 8% on its 2006 allocation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 53, 56, 139, 168 and 513 together.</P>
        <P>I refer to the reply to Priority Question No. 46 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.</P>
        <P>As already stated the funding that I will be providing to local authorities for 2007, through general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund, will continue the strong trend of increasing central government support for the local government sector.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I announced the allocation of almost &euro;958m to local authorities for 2007, increasing the level of general purpose grants by 8% over the final allocations for 2006.  The 2007 allocations figure is 2.8 times the initial allocation provided in 1997.  This funding will assist local authorities in framing realistic and reasonable budgets in the statutory time period available to them to complete their budgetary process.</P><Col N="799"/>
        <P>The Government has provided unprecedented increases in funding to local authorities since 1997.  I am satisfied that with our commitment to local government, and increased income buoyancy generated from the greatly strengthened commercial base supported by the Government&rsquo;s successful economic policies, local authorities are in a very good position to respond to the public&rsquo;s need for quality services.  I would also like to draw the House&rsquo;s attention to the increase in development contributions, which I mentioned in an earlier reply.</P>
        <P>In allocating funding for 2007, I have taken into account the cost to each authority of providing its services, and factors including population increases, and the income from local sources.</P>
        <P>The adoption of a budget is one of the most important reserved functions conferred on local authorities as it underpins their financial business for the following year.  While I have no direct function in budgetary decision-making at local level, I have urged local authorities to continue to exercise appropriate restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates and charges.  This is important to the long-term viability and competitiveness of commercial operations and to the overall competitiveness of the economy.  Local authorities responded positively this year to my request in this regard and increases in rates and charges for 2006 were generally of a lower order than in previous years.</P><Col N="800"/>
        <P>In this regard, I am also bringing forward an amendment this week, to the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Bill 2006, to enhance the role of audit committees in local authorities and to provide for outside expert membership.  Audit committees will in future review financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures within a local authority; foster the development of best practice in the internal audit function; review auditor&rsquo;s reports and assess follow-up action by management; assess and promote efficiency and value for money; and review risk management systems.</P>
        <P>Current expenditure in the local government sector in 2007 is likely to be some &euro;4.5bn. Within this quantum of expenditure there is scope for efficiencies, innovation and further steps to ensure greater value for money. Elected members should examine their draft budget closely to ensure that every effort is made to get the maximum value for the expenditure proposed.</P>
        <P>The funding accruing to the Local Government Fund comprises the proceeds of Motor Tax, an Exchequer contribution and interest earned on balances of the Fund. These are consolidated into the Fund; grants can not be attributed to specific elements of the Fund.</P>
        <P>The following table shows, for each local authority, the allocations of general purpose grants from 2000 to 2007 and the percentage increases provided.</P><Col N="799"/>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 59 together.</P>
        <P>In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.</P>
        <P>In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register, which included the use of Census enumerators or other temporary personnel to support local authorities in preparing the Register; over 1,500 personnel were engaged in this work.</P>
        <P>There has been regular contact with local authorities throughout this year&rsquo;s electoral registration campaign, particularly in relation to establishing the overall framework in which the campaign was carried out and the compilation of data related to the process and its outcome.</P>
        <P>The agreed procedures included provision for ensuring that each household was visited at least twice and provided with forms and information, if necessary. In the event that this process did not satisfactorily register the household, written notification would then be given cautioning of the danger of being omitted from the Register.</P>
        <P>I also committed to providing additional ring-fenced financial resources to support local authorities&rsquo; own spending in respect of the register campaign and advised authorities that a contribution of some &euro;6 million can be made available in this regard. To date, &euro;3 million has been paid to local authorities and a further &euro;2 million in register funding is being processed. Another &euro;1 million was provided for a national publicity and awareness campaign involving TV, radio, press and outdoor advertising.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have carried out an extensive and intensive campaign in respect of the Draft Register for 2007/8, with both large numbers of additions to, and deletions from, the Register. On this basis, I am satisfied there will be significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.</P>
        <P>The process is not finished. Following requests from three local authorities, I have provided an extension of time to all councils and county registrars to complete their work on the Register &mdash; up until the 2nd and 12th January respectively. The final date for entry into force of the new register remains 15th February 2007.  If any person is omitted from the Final Register, they will still have the opportunity to apply for entry on to the Supplement to the Register up to 15 days before polling day.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the substantial increases in charges at local government level for local customers in areas where both a water and waste water treatment service is provided; and if he will significantly increase funding to local government; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Governments water pricing policy requires full and transparent cost recovery of water services &mdash; this covers both water and waste water services &mdash; supplied to the non-domestic sector.  Cost recovery from the non-domestic sector is to be achieved by way of a consolidated meter based volumetric charge, derived from separate rates applicable to water and waste water services.  If a non-domestic consumer does not discharge to the public network, for example, where waste water is discharged to the consumer&rsquo;s septic tank, no charge for waste water services will arise.  In general, it is not envisaged that an increased burden will arise for non-domestic consumers, solely because water and waste water (where applicable) rates are separately identified.  Increases may however arise where a local authority operating the pricing policy had not previously sought to secure cost recovery from their non-domestic consumers.  </P>
        <P>In relation to the funding of the operational cost of water services provision, yesterday I announced the general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund to local authorities for 2007.  This continued the trend of increasing central government support for the local government sector.  In addition, a special Local Government Fund allocation of &euro;10m was made in the budget to assist local authorities with extra running costs incurred in the operation of new water services infrastructure that is supporting unprecedented new development in recent years.</P>

	<P>As stated in response to previous Questions, the Government has for many years, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with radon. In reply to Question No. 607 of 1 November 2006, I outlined the numerous initiatives undertaken by the RPII and my Department. Householders, particularly those in high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary.</P>
        <P>Increasing the awareness of the public is considered to be a more effective approach than the provision of State financial assistance schemes to householders for radon testing of their homes or for radon remediation works. Such schemes of assistance are not operated by the majority of EU Member States.  It would be difficult for a demand led scheme of domestic radon grants to ensure appropriate and cost effective targeting of remedial action. Furthermore, such a scheme could require very significant public expenditure and administrative resources.</P>
        <P>Government efforts and resources, together with the RPII, will continue to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders and employers so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 71 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has provided some &euro;90.2 million, through my Department towards the local authority public library service over the years 1997 to 2006.  On foot of this expenditure, supplemented by local authorities from their own resources, 57 new library buildings will have been opened by the end of 2006.  In addition, the investment has also contributed to the provision and development of ICT including</P>

        <P FLI="0">The development and population of the Ask About Ireland website and the digitisation of library authorities&rsquo; local studies material has also been supported.</P>
        <P>The library service was the subject of a major review in 1997/1998, which resulted in the publication of Branching Out: A New Public Library Service in 1998.  This report put forward a series of recommendations designed to bring the public library service into the 21st century.  One of the key recommendations in the report was that an eight-year capital programme be undertaken and that recommendation, along with the others in the report, was approved by Government.</P>
        <P>A full review of Branching Out, in the light of Ireland&rsquo;s current economic and social climate, is currently nearing completion.  On the basis of this review, I will be publishing an updated policy and vision for the public library service over the next 6 years early in the New Year.</P>

        <Quest> the way Ireland compares with other EU member states regarding their progress towards meeting their targets under the Kyoto protocol. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Kyoto Protocol requires that, the then 15 Member States in the European Union must reduce their aggregate emissions by 8% on 1990 levels during the 2008-2012 Kyoto commitment period.  There is no equivalent joint commitment for the current 25 Member States. Under burden-sharing arrangements agreed by the EU in 2002, Ireland must limit its emissions to not greater than 13% above 1990 levels in the 2008-2012 period.</P>
        <P>The latest report from the European Commission Progress Towards Achieving the Kyoto <Col N="811"/>Objectives (COM (2006) 658), shows that, based on the latest available inventory data (2004), the EU-15 have a gap of almost 8 percentage points to close in order to reach the target, while Ireland&rsquo;s gap is slightly higher at 10 percentage points.  Comparing recent progress, however, shows that Ireland has reduced the gap by  4 percentage points since 2001,  while there was a slight increase in the gap in the EU-15 as a whole over the same period.</P>
        <P>The report projects that the EU-15 will reach its target of reducing emissions to 8% below 1990 levels during the 2008-2012 period. This will be possible with additional measures, use of carbon sinks and use of the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms to purchase allowances. Ireland will also meet its target under the EU burden-sharing agreement with existing and additional domestic measures, use of carbon sinks and use of the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms.</P>

	<P>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is designed to cater for the accommodation needs of persons in receipt of rent supplement who have a long-term housing need. Funding is provided by the Department to local authorities to meet the cost of the scheme, including accommodation costs, through the transfer of resources from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>The level of rents payable is determined by negotiations between the landlord and the local authority. Authorities have been advised that any agreement on rent levels should reflect local market conditions and the appropriate SWA rent supplement rent level for the area for the particular type of household. The setting of rent limits under the SWA scheme is a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and his Department is currently reviewing levels of  rent limits to determine what limits should apply from January 2007 onwards. The aim is that any new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied at this early stage that there  is considerable scope and opportunities within the arrangements for local authorities to negotiate rents and secure accommodation within the financial model underpinning RAS.</P>
        <P>Some local authorities have reported difficulties from time to time in finding good quality alternative accommodation, at a reasonable rent, for single persons and couples without children.

	<P>Section 10 (2) (a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that a planning authority&rsquo;s development plan shall include objectives for the zoning of land for the use solely or primarily of particular areas for particular purposes (whether residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, as open space or otherwise, or a mixture of those uses).  Also, Section 13 (1) of the Act provides that a planning authority may at any time, for stated reasons, decide to make a variation of a development plan.  Accordingly, the details of land zoned from agricultural to development (which could be residential, commercial or industrial) would be set out in each planning authority&rsquo;s development plan.   My Department does not seek or retain these details.</P>
        <P>My Department does however carry out a survey, through the local authorities, of the total amount of serviced land zoned for residential purposes, owned both privately and by local authorities, at the end of June each year. This survey is valuable in assessing the overall stock of land at the same point each year, and the sufficiency of that stock to underpin required housing supply.  Details from the survey are published annually in my Department&rsquo;s Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library, and on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>While figures from the June 2006 survey are still being compiled, the results of the June, 2005 survey indicate that there were some 14,000 hectares of residentially zoned land available at that time to support future housing supply, with an estimated yield of about 460,000 housing units nationally.</P>

	<P>Substantial progress has been made in my Department on the implementation of e-Government.</P>
        <P>Vehicle ownership and taxation represent my Department&rsquo;s largest area of direct service provision to citizens and, at an early stage, the Government&rsquo;s Information Society Action Plan identified motor tax as a priority area for electronic service delivery.  The motor tax online service, available at www.motortax.ie (as Gaeilge &mdash;  www.motarchain.ie), went live in 2004.  In 2005, &euro;168 million was collected in over 800,000 individual transactions on the site representing 30% of all eligible business nationwide, rising to almost 50% in Dublin.  It is expected that these figures will be exceeded in 2006, with overall take-up running at 34% and forecast revenue approaching &euro;250 million.  In addition, a major new area of service was added to the site last year enabling vehicle owners to tax new vehicles for the first time online.</P>
        <P>A project has been underway since September this year to enable motor dealers to use a secure electronic service to notify my Department of changes of vehicle ownership.  This substantially enhances the service offered to those dealers and to owners and will improve the accuracy and currency of vehicle ownership records.  This system will also handle notifications of end of vehicle life from Authorised Treatment Facilities (ATFs) as required under waste legislation.</P>
        <P>The growing level of interest in local heritage and wildlife around the country is reflected in the enthusiastic response to the Department&rsquo;s www.buildingsofireland.ie site, which attractively presents highlights of our built heritage on a county by county basis as the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is carried out.  In the new year, I will be launching a site which will use Geographical Information System (GIS) technology to deliver readily accessible map-based information on archaeological sites and monuments.  This service will later be extended to include information on our natural heritage.</P>
        <P>Many of the services promoted by my Department are delivered by local authorities and partner agencies and I am pleased that they have also responded to the challenges and opportunities of electronic service delivery.  Various local authorities around the country enable citizens to use the internet to perform activities such as viewing and downloading planning applications, accessing library catalogues and reserving books, paying service charges, and accessing a wide range of forms and information.</P><Col N="815"/>

	<P>The Ten Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, includes a commitment to publishing a renewed National Sustainable Development Strategy by mid 2007.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s first sustainable development strategy, Sustainable Development &mdash; A Strategy for Ireland was published in 1997. A review of the Strategy, Making Ireland&rsquo;s Development Sustainable, was published in 2002, ahead of the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg.  The renewed EU Sustainable Development Strategy was adopted by the European Council at their meeting in June, 2006.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s renewed Sustainable Development Strategy will take account of the renewed EU Strategy and our specific circumstances including:</P><Col N="816"/>

        <P>The provision and improvement of non-national roads is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.</P><Col N="817"/>
        <P>There have been significant increases in recent years in the level of State aid provided to local authorities for the provision, improvement and maintenance of non-national roads.  State aid in 2006 for non-national roads, at almost &euro;558 million, is the highest ever level of funding available and represents a very substantial increase of 13% on last year&rsquo;s record allocation, or an increase of almost &euro;62.5 million. The 2006 allocation also represents an increase of almost &euro;419 million, or over 300%, on the 1994 grant payment and an increase of almost &euro;332 million, or almost 150%, on the 1997 grant payment.</P>
        <P>Details of total non-national road grants paid by my Department for each of the years 1994 to 2005 and the initial allocation for 2006 are set out in the following table:				</P>

        <P FLI="0">As regards my Department&rsquo;s pavement  restoration programme, the results of a Pavement Condition Study on non-national roads, which was carried out by consultants and completed in 2005, show that there has been a very large growth in traffic volumes, including numbers of heavy goods vehicles, on our roads over the last 10 years and that the combination of growth in traffic volumes and damaging power has dramatically increased the structural loading on the non-national roads network. The study concludes that the economic boom, since the first study was carried out in 1996, has fundamentally changed the loading regime on the non-national roads network, with much higher and more frequent loading by heavier vehicles now being the norm.</P>
        <P>The rate of occurrence of potholes and road disintegration has effectively halved since 1996 as a result of the &euro;1.5 billion investment in Restoration Improvement and Maintenance works over the 1997 to 2004 period. However, the instance of other defects, such as rutting and edge cracking, has increased since 1996 as a result of growth in traffic on the network &mdash; particularly that of heavier and wider commercial vehicles.</P><Col N="818"/>
        <P>On foot of the findings of the study, I have increased the grants available for Restoration Improvement works to &euro;205.3 million in 2006, which is an increase of over &euro;31 million, or almost 18%, on the 2005 allocation. This very substantial increase means that significant progress can be made in allocating funds to address the deficiencies identified by the Pavement Condition Study. I have also allocated grants totalling &euro;75 million for Restoration Maintenance works this year. This represents an increase of &euro;15 million, or 25%, on the 2005 allocation.  I intend to announce non-national road grant allocations for 2007 early in the new year.</P>
        <P>Insofar as development levies are concerned, under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities, provided by or on behalf of a local authority, that benefit development in the area, based on a scheme of contributions adopted for the area.  The types of public infrastructure that can be funded by a development contribution scheme are:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the acquisition of land,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the provision of open spaces, recreational and community facilities and amenities and landscaping works,</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the provision of roads, car parks, car parking places, sewers, waste water and water treatment facilities, drains and watermains,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the provision of bus corridors and lanes, bus interchange facilities (including car parks for those facilities), infrastructure to facilitate public transport, cycle and pedestrian facilities and traffic calming measures,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the refurbishment, upgrading, enlargement or replacement of roads, car parks, car parking places, sewers, waste water and water treatment facilities, drains or water mains and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />matters ancillary to the above.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Based on information supplied to my Department by local authorities, &euro;90.3 million of development contribution monies were applied to roads and car-parking in 2005.  The equivalent figures for 2004 and 2003 were &euro;70.2 million and &euro;46.6 million, respectively.</P>
        <P>The National Roads Authority, which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Transport, has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction, improvement and maintenance of national roads.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 154 together.</P>
        <P>In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register; house to house or other sufficient enquiries must be made for this purpose.</P>
        <P>In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register, which included the use of Census enumerators or other temporary personnel to support local authorities in preparing the Register; over 1,500 personnel were engaged in this work.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department worked with a group of local authority managers and senior officials to put in place an enhanced programme for improving the next Register.  Detailed procedures for the carrying out of registration fieldwork were finalised and issued to local authorities in early July. The procedures included provision for ensuring that each household was visited and provided with forms and information at least <Col N="820"/>twice, if necessary. In the event that this process did not satisfactorily register the household,  written notification would then be given cautioning of the danger of being omitted from the Register.</P>
        <P>I also committed to providing additional ring-fenced financial resources to support local authorities&rsquo; own spending in respect of the register campaign and advised authorities that a contribution of some &euro;6 million can be made available in this regard. An initial allocation of some &euro;3 million, based on the number of households in each local authority area, was made available in July to local authorities for registration work.</P>
        <P>As regards publicity and awareness, a two-stage approach was developed, involving information notices followed by an intensive media campaign.  Information notices were published in the national press on 19&ndash;21 August, urging co-operation with local register campaigns. In addition, a national publicity and awareness campaign involving TV, radio, press and outdoor advertising ran from 11 September.</P>
        <P>An online register search facility was made available through local authority websites and a central website www.checktheregister.ie was also set up, containing direct links to each local authority&rsquo;s eReg enquiry screen, to facilitate people in checking that they are on the Draft Register.</P>
        <P>New arrangements for the deletion of names of deceased persons from the Register are now in place: the new system allows for the efficient and timely deletion of the names of deceased persons from the Register using the Death Event Publication Service which has been developed by Reach in association with the General Register Office.</P>
        <P>New guidance for local authorities on Preparing and Maintaining the Register of Electors was made available to authorities in electronic format on 31 May. Printed copies of the guidance were subsequently sent to all local authorities, returning officers and relevant Government Departments. In the final version of the guidance, the importance of local authorities cross-checking the Register with other databases available to them was stressed.</P>
        <P>I provided an additional two weeks &mdash; from 25 November to 9 December &mdash; to allow persons not on the Draft Register to apply for inclusion on the Final Register to be published on 1 February 2007.  That gave people over five weeks  &mdash; from 1 November to 9 December &mdash; to check, and apply for entry on, the Register.  Local authorities now have until 2 January to make corrections to the Draft Register; county registrars have until 12 January to make amendments to it and people interested have a legal right to be heard in this regard.  I also advanced legislative provision so that lists of persons on the current register but not included on the Draft Register can be made available by local authorities. In addition, a person who is not on the Final Register may apply for inclusion on the Supplement to the Register <Col N="821"/>which closes on the fifteenth day before the next polling day.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have carried out an extensive and intensive campaign in respect of  the Draft Register for 2007/8, with both significant numbers of additions to, and deletions from, the Register. On this basis, and taking account of the other measures set out above, I am satisfied there will be significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register, with a consequent enhancement of the capacity of  the Register to assist in the prevention of personation.</P>
        <P>Electoral law provides that, at the polling station the returning officer or the presiding officer may, or if required by a personation agent shall, request any person applying for a ballot paper to produce a specified identification document.  The range of documents includes commonly accepted forms of identification containing photographs such as a passport, a driving licence, an employee identity card and a student identity card. Other types of specified documents, such as cheque books or cards, and birth or marriage certificates, must be accompanied by further documentation which establishes the address of the holder in the constituency.</P>
        <P>If a person fails to produce a required document, or if the returning officer or the presiding officer is not satisfied that the person is the person to whom the document relates, they are not to be permitted to vote.  My Department has considerably strengthened the recommendations to returning officers and presiding officers about the frequency of document checking. Prior to 2002, the recommended frequency was 1 in 20; in 2002, this was increased to 1 in 4.</P>
        <P>Electoral law also contains other provisions in relation to personation, including a range of offences and penalties in this regard; a new offence was provided for under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2004 for the unlawful possession or use of a polling information card. I will continue to keep this important matter, including the scope for further improvements, under review.</P>
        <P>Finally, there is a need to maintain a proper balance between the requirement to uphold the security and integrity of the electoral process and providing a necessary degree of flexibility.   The Supplement to the Register provides an important opportunity for people, who would otherwise not be able to vote, to be included on the Register; at the same time, it is necessary to ensure that appropriate controls are in place in this regard. There are no proposals for amendment of the relevant legislative provisions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 151 and 162 together.</P>
        <P>Government policy envisages full and transparent cost recovery of water services supplied to the non-domestic sector. The policy also provides for the continued funding of the cost of providing water and waste water infrastructure to domestic users through the capital budget of my Department and, in the case of operational costs, through the Local Government Fund.</P>
        <P>Cost recovery from the non-domestic sector is to be achieved by a consolidated citywide or countywide, meter based volumetric charge.  The policy provides for cost recovery without profit, with charges based on actual metered consumption and no cross subsidisation of the domestic sector by non-domestic consumers.   Where there <Col N="823"/>is a mixture of domestic and non-domestic use, such as a farm, an allowance is made by the local authority for the domestic element, which is deducted from the overall charge to the consumer.</P>
        <P>Local authorities, in line with the above policies, are moving towards the metering of all non-domestic water use.  The effect of this will be to enable local authorities to measure the amount of water supplied to each non-domestic connection to the water service.  This will provide a transparent and equitable cost recovery mechanism for water services in accordance with the polluter pays principle and should incentivise all non-domestic users to conserve their use of water and thus minimise this element of their running costs.</P>
        <P>Under existing arrangements, the Exchequer makes no contribution towards the funding of non-domestic water services provision.  However, the Exchequer fully funds the capital cost of water and waste water infrastructure for all existing domestic consumers and contributes to the funding of future domestic water services provision where this is incorporated in proposed schemes, with the balance of this portion being met from development levies. The marginal capital cost and operational costs for the non-domestic sector must be met through water charges and development levies.</P>
        <P>The domestic element of the operational cost of local authority water services falls to be met through the Local Government Fund. The provision for this fund has increased from some &euro;470m in 2000 to over &euro;870m in 2006.  Yesterday I announced general purpose grants of some &euro;948m to local authorities for 2007, from the Local Government Fund. This represents an increase of 8% in the compared with the final allocations for 2006.  The 2007 allocations figure moreover represents an increase of some 35% over the initial allocations provided in 1997. Additionally a special local government fund allocation of &euro;10m has been made in Budget 2007 to assist local authorities with extra running costs incurred in the operation of new water services infrastructure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 101, 115, 132 and 157 together.</P>
        <P>In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register; house to house or other sufficient enquiries must be made for this purpose.</P>
        <P>In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register, which included the use of Census enumerators or other temporary personnel to support local authorities in preparing the Register; over 1,500 personnel were engaged in this work.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department worked with a group of local authority managers and senior officials to put in place an enhanced programme for improving the next Register.  Detailed procedures for the carrying out of registration fieldwork were finalised and issued to local authorities in early July. The procedures included provision for ensuring that each household was visited and provided with forms and information at least twice, if necessary. In the event that this process did not satisfactorily register the household,  written notification would then be given cautioning of the danger of being omitted from the Register.</P>
        <P>I also committed to providing additional ring-fenced financial resources to support local authorities&rsquo; own spending in respect of the register campaign and advised authorities that a contribution of some &euro;6 million can be made available in this regard. An initial allocation of some &euro;3 million, based on the number of households in each local authority area, was made available in <Col N="825"/>July to local authorities for registration work and a further &euro;2 million in register funding is being processed.</P>
        <P>As regards publicity and awareness, a two-stage approach was developed, involving information notices followed by an intensive media campaign.  Information notices were published in the national press on 19&ndash;21 August, urging co-operation with local register campaigns. In addition, a national publicity and awareness campaign costing &euro;1 million and involving TV, radio, press and outdoor advertising ran from 11 September.</P>
        <P>An online register search facility was made available through local authority websites and a central website www.checktheregister.ie was also set up, containing direct links to each local authority&rsquo;s eReg enquiry screen, to facilitate people in checking that they are on the Draft Register.</P>
        <P>New arrangements for the deletion of names of deceased persons from the Register are now in place: the new system allows for the efficient and timely deletion of the names of deceased persons from the Register using the Death Event Publication Service which has been developed by Reach in association with the General Register Office.</P>
        <P>New guidance for local authorities on Preparing and Maintaining the Register of Electors was made available to authorities in electronic format on 31 May. Printed copies of the guidance were subsequently sent to all local authorities, returning officers and relevant Government Departments. In the final version of the guidance, the importance of local authorities cross-checking the Register with other databases available to them was stressed.</P>
        <P>I provided an additional two weeks &mdash; from 25 November to 9 December &mdash; to allow persons not on the Draft Register to apply for inclusion on the Final Register to be published on 1 February 2007.  That gave people over five weeks &mdash; from 1 November to 9 December &mdash; to check, and apply for entry on, the Register.  Local authorities now have until 2 January to make corrections to the Draft Register; county registrars have until 12 January to make amendments to it and people interested have a legal right to be heard in this regard.  I also advanced legislative provision so that lists of persons on the current register but not included on the Draft Register can be made available by local authorities. In addition, a person who is not on the Final Register may apply for inclusion on the Supplement to the Register which closes on the fifteenth day before the next polling day.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have carried out an extensive and intensive campaign in respect of  the Draft Register for 2007/8, with the information available indicating both significant numbers of additions (379,394) to, and deletions (505,042) from, the Register. Some 170,000 people were written to asking them to contact their council to <Col N="826"/>confirm their details and warning of the danger of being omitted from the Register. Final figures regarding the number of additions to and deletions from the Register will not be known until authorities and County Registrars have completed their work and the final register is published in February. However, on the basis of the work already undertaken, I am satisfied there will be significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 92, 105, 159, 538, 539, 543 and 544 together.</P>
        <P>Details of water services schemes approved by my Department are set out in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  Earlier this year my Department asked all local authorities to provide updated assessments of their needs for additional water services infrastructure and to review their priorities in light of economic, demographic and other developments that had taken place since the last such assessments were produced in 2003.   The latest assessments will inform the selection of new schemes for inclusion in the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.  Information in relation to proposals included in the assessments for any particular area may appropriately be sought from the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;3.7 billion is being invested in new and upgraded water and wastewater infrastructure under the current National Development Plan.  A total of 337 schemes were completed under the Water Services Investment Programme in the period from January 2000 to mid 2006.  These schemes have, inter alia, generated additional wastewater treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.1 million, seven times greater than the entire increase over the period of the previous National Development Plan, together with sufficient additional drinking water treatment capacity for a population of 660,000.  The Exchequer capital provision for water services infrastructure next year is up 7% <Col N="828"/>on the 2006 provision and the new National Development Plan will continue the current focus on providing water services infrastructure to support strong economic and social development, while at the same time preserving the highest environmental standards.</P>
        <?oasys _dc10- ?><P>The position with regard to the funding of individual schemes is that the capital cost of services to cater for the domestic sector is met by the Exchequer through the Water Services Investment Programme.  Under Water Services Pricing Policy, and in accordance with the EU Water Framework Directive, the marginal capital cost of services for the non-domestic sector is recovered by local authorities from non-domestic consumers on a consolidated countywide basis over a period of up to twenty years. The proportion of overall costs represented by the non-domestic contribution varies from scheme to scheme, depending on general design parameters, the overall capacity of a scheme and the breakdown of domestic and non-domestic demand.  Typically the level of capital support by my Department for new water service infrastructure is in the range 85% to 90%, and not 30% to 35% as implied in the Question.</P><?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>I have introduced a number of measures to streamline the approval procedures and reduce administration at Departmental and local authority level in order to move projects to construction as soon as possible.  I have reduced the number of stage approvals local authorities are required to obtain from my Department and also simplified Water Services Pricing Policy procedures and affordability criteria.  Overall I am satisfied that the current levels of funding, together with the resources and administrative supports available to my Department and the local authorities, will ensure that projects under the Water Services Investment Programme will move ahead urgently.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 78, 79, 82, 112, 119, 141, 152 and 509 together.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Electronic Voting concluded in its Second Report on the Secrecy, Accuracy and Testing of the Chosen Electronic Voting System, which was published on 4 July 2006, that it can recommend the voting and counting equipment for use at elections in Ireland, subject to further work it has recommended. The Commission made it clear that many of its recommendations involve only relatively minor modifications or additions to the system.</P><Col N="830"/>
        <P>In response to the report, the Government has established a Cabinet Committee on Electronic Voting, which I chair, to consider the report in detail; report to the Government on the full implications of the Commission recommendations; consider the composition of a peer review group  &mdash; drawn from international electoral reform bodies and the IT industry &mdash; to supervise any software redesign work; report to the Government on confidence building measures; and identify any other improvements that might be built into the system.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet Committee, which also includes the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, met on 31 July 2006.  Its work is underway and it will meet again in the near future.  The issue of a peer review group will be considered by the Committee at the appropriate stage of its deliberations. The Committee will report to Government when its work is completed. As part of its work in this regard, my Department monitors ongoing and emerging developments at international level in relation to electronic voting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The timing of the further use of the system will be related to the progress, of the cabinet committee&rsquo;s ongoing work, the associated decisions arising in this regard, and the dates at which future polls may be held.</P>
        <P>The Government decision to proceed with the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised premises was made taking into account a range of factors, including costs of current and centralised arrangements and the likely benefits to be realised.  In this regard, the Commission in its Second Report concluded that, as the current arrangements under which voting equipment is stored at 25 locations are likely to give rise to continuing variations in the implementation of security and related control measures, together with replication of similar costs of implementation of these measures which are not insignificant across individual centres, enhanced and more uniform security and greater economy of security costs could be achieved through the rationalisation of storage on a regional or centralised basis; preparatory work in relation to the planned use of Gormanston Aerodrome is advanced in this regard.</P>
        <P>The total cost to date of the development and roll-out of the electronic voting and counting system is &euro;51.3 million (including &euro;2.6 million in respect of awareness and education initiatives). In addition, information provided by returning officers to my Department indicates that the annual storage costs for the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment is currently some &euro;705,000. It is not possible to detail conclusively at this stage the total costs which will be associated with the centralised storage arrangements, including costs relating to local storage of the electronic voting machines at election time. Arrangements are being made for the procure<Col N="831"/>ment of metal storage containers for Gormanston Aerodrome at a cost of &euro;87,150 (excluding VAT); insulation of these containers will cost a further &euro;10,290 (excluding VAT).</P>

	<P>My Department published Residential Density Guidelines for Planning Authorities in 1999, aimed at improving the quality in new housing by supporting more compact and sustainable forms of residential development.  The thrust of the Guidelines was to promote higher residential density at appropriate locations particularly in conjunction with improved public transport systems.</P>
        <P>My Department intends to review the Guidelines with a view to up-dating them next year.  The review will take account of experiences to date with the 1999 guidelines, the rapidly changing demographics and settlement patterns, the need for more compact urban development (particularly within the Greater Dublin Area) and the on-going policy of delivering sustainable communities and enhancing quality of life.  The revised Guidelines will focus particularly on the quality of new developments.  They will also take account of the extensive experience built up since the introduction of the Guidelines in the design, assessment and development of higher density proposals.</P>
        <P>In light of the need to provide a wider housing/planning policy context for sustainable urban housing, my Department intends to produce a series of inter-related guidance documents, comprising:</P>

My Department does not compile data in regard to their specific enforcement activities, but is aware that verification of waste destinations is carried out by individual authorities. Ireland is actively engaged within the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL), an informal network of environmental enforcement authorities, is chair of the IMPEL TFS cluster of authorities for 2006/2007 and has participated in two verification of waste destination projects to date and will be participating in further enforcement projects in 2007. The verification projects already carried out, and which have involved five local authorities during 2005 and 2006, have shown that all of the waste shipments checked have been recovered or disposed of at the country of destination in accordance with the required procedures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied that the co-operation between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in relation to environmental impact assessments (EIA) is effective and, furthermore, is fully in accord with the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (337/85/ EEC).</P>
        <P>The interface between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the EPA has been developed and refined over the years and is now provided for in the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006; the Environmental Protection Agency Acts 1992 to <Col N="834"/>2005; the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2005: and in Regulations made under those Acts.</P>
        <P>Essentially, planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la deal with the planning and land use aspects of development proposals which also require IPPC licensing, whereas the EPA deals with the environmental aspects of emissions from the carrying out of the activity. However, a planning authority or the Board may also refuse planning permission for a proposed development in any case where it considers that the development, notwithstanding the IPPC licensing of the activity, is unacceptable on environmental grounds.</P>
        <P>As the Reasoned Opinion issued by the EU Commission may result in litigation before the European Court of Justice (ECJ), it would not be appropriate for me to disclose the content of any correspondence or discussion between the EU Commission and Ireland on this subject.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 99 together.</P><Col N="835"/>
        <P>At national level substantial progress is being made in implementing the National Spatial Strategy (NSS), which is having an increasing influence on policies and programmes across a range of Government Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>At regional level, a key policy bridge between national development priorities and local planning has been put in place with the adoption of Regional Planning Guidelines to provide a strategic framework for local planning.</P>
        <P>At county and city level, strategic land use and planning frameworks for all the Gateways are almost complete.  The potential impact of the Strategy in terms of achieving more balanced regional development has been underscored by the Government&rsquo;s decision in July 2005 that the regional dimension of the next National Development Plan, now in preparation, will be broadly based on the NSS.  The priorities of the NSS and regional planning guidelines have also been recognised in the Government&rsquo;s 10-year investment plan for transport, Transport 21.</P>
        <P>To support the development of the NSS Gateways, my Department in conjunction with Forf&aacute;s, commissioned the Gateway Investment Priorities Study.  This study has been completed and was jointly published on my Department&rsquo;s and Forf&aacute;s&rsquo;s websites in October of this year.  The study addresses the Gateway&rsquo;s potential for accelerated development in housing, commercial and employment terms and the key infrastructure priorities that will be necessary to facilitate such development.  The study sets out relevant issues in each Gateway, such as economic infrastructure, enterprise and economy, quality of life and local capacity.  It identifies short-term and long-term investment priorities for each of the Gateways and proposes mechanisms through which these can feed into the next NDP and other national policies and programmes. Similar work is also being undertaken in relation to the hubs identified in the NSS.</P>
        <P>In addition, I launched the Atlantic Gateways Initiative in September 2006; this is aimed at having Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford collaboratively creating a critical mass for future economic development as a counter-balance to Dublin and the East.  The report, with recommended actions and timescales, explores how the four gateways can become an increasingly interconnected and developed network of co-operating and complementary cities.  This can, in turn, enhance the development potential of all four gateways and invigorate development in the hub towns and the wider urban and rural catchment areas.</P>
        <P>Draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans were published for public consultation last April.  These Guidelines emphasise the importance within such plans of creating a clear strategic framework for the proper planning and sustainable development of the relevant <Col N="836"/>area consistent with the longer-term aims set out in the National Spatial Strategy and regional planning guidelines.  Comments on the Draft Guidelines are currently being considered by my Department with a view to finalising the Guidelines in the near future.</P>
        <P>My Department, in co-operation with other relevant Departments, is also pursuing measures to enhance cooperation on spatial planning and infrastructural investment across the island of Ireland, as endorsed by the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  As announced following a meeting of the Conference on 2 May, my Department, working in conjunction with the Department of Regional Development in Northern Ireland, is preparing a framework for collaborative action between the NSS and the Regional Development Strategy for Northern Ireland to assist in creating conditions that will facilitate enhanced competitiveness on the island.</P>

        <P FLI="0">My Department has successfully promoted a range of measures to provide additional social housing in recent years, and is committed to maintaining a strong programme of social housing provision into the future.  In the three year period 2007-2009 we are specifically committed to increased investment in social housing with 27,000 new units to be started over the period.   This will include the commencement/acquisition of an additional 4,000 new housing units through a combination of local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing and RAS long-term contractual arrangements for new supply as provided for under Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>Government has been and will continue to be resolute in its determination to address issues of housing affordability.   A range of targeted schemes to assist first time buyers has been put in place in recent years. These include the Shared Ownership Scheme, the 1999 affordable housing scheme, affordable housing through Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006 and <Col N="838"/>the Affordable Housing Initiative under Sustaining Progress.  Output under the various schemes is projected at some 3,000 homes this year.  For the period 2007-2009 we have set ourselves an even more ambitious target of some 17,000 homes to meet continuing need.</P>
        <P>Finally, arising from commitments set out in the Housing Policy Framework document &mdash; Building Sustainable Communities and the new Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, a new, more objective, approach to the assessment of housing needs is being developed.

	<P>On Budget day (6 December) I announced new proposals which will provide an incentive through the motor tax system for the motoring public to drive cleaner cars. The new proposal will use CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission ratings, in addition to the normal engine c.c. value, in the calculation of motor tax and will rebalance tax payments in favour of cars with lower CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission levels, at the expense of cars with high emission levels. This rebalancing will be applied to any new or pre-owned imported vehicle, registered in this country on or after 1 January, 2008 and taxed within the &lsquo;Private Car&rsquo; motor tax class, which make up about 75% of vehicles registered each year. Cars, which are registered prior to 1 January 2008, will continue to be taxed under current arrangements and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> ratings will not apply to these vehicles.  A public consultation paper on motor tax rebalancing is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.environ.ie and I have invited interested parties to make submissions by 1 March 2007.</P>
        <P>Current motor tax rates have remained unchanged since 2004; receipts up to the end of November 2006 show an increase of 10% compared with last year, against a background of a 6% increase in the national vehicle fleet.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 125 together.</P>
        <P>There has been a radical transformation in recycling rates in Ireland in the last ten years.  Recycling is a significant element of the Government&rsquo;s overall integrated policy framework on <Col N="840"/>waste management &mdash; which is based on the internationally recognised waste hierarchy &mdash; prioritising waste prevention, minimisation, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and the environmentally sound disposal of residual waste which cannot be recycled or recovered.</P>
        <P>This significant emphasis on recycling is reflected in the 1998 policy statement Changing Our Ways which provided a national policy framework for the adoption and implementation by local authorities of strategic waste management plans under which specific national objectives and targets would be achieved. Specifically, Changing our Ways set ambitious recycling targets to be achieved over a fifteen year timescale &mdash; i.e. by 2013 &mdash; including a recycling target of 35% of municipal waste recycling.  Government  policy on recycling was further elaborated in the policy statements Delivering Change in 2002 and Taking Stock and Moving Forward  in 2004.</P>

        <P>The dramatic increases in recycling rates for household waste have been driven by successful Government policies including:</P>

         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the continued expansion of the numbers of bring facilities.  Since 2002, some &euro;90 million has been allocated to assist local authorities in the provision of greatly expanded recycling facilities.  This has facilitated an increase in Bring Banks from 837 in 1998 to 1,929 in 2004 and in Civic Amenity sites form 30 in 1998 to 69 in 2004.  In 2006, additional Exchequer funding of &euro;10m has also for the first time been made available. This reflects the importance which the Government attaches to supporting local authorities in the provision of these very important facilities;</P>

        <P FLI="0">In order to provide further impetus in this area, a range of further measures have also been, or are in the process of being, undertaken:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />successful producer responsibility initiatives are in place to support the achievement of recycling targets for certain waste materials e.g the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) scheme introduced in August 2005 has lead to a five-fold increase in recycling of this waste stream while the European Union 2005 target of 50% recovery rate for packaging waste was exceeded in 2003 and reached 56.4% in 2004;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April 2006. In 2004, almost three quarters of municipal (household and commercial) waste sent to landfill was biodegradable. The Strategy <Col N="842"/>sets out measures aimed at the separate collection, recovery and recycling of biodegradable waste with a view to achieving the progressive diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill by 2016 to 35% of the amount of biodegradable municipal waste generated in the baseline year of 1995; and</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the Market Development Group was established in 2004 to oversee the development of a Market Development Programme which will identify new applications and markets for recyclable material and secondary recycled products.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Following a European Court of Justice judgment in April 2005 which found that Ireland had not properly transposed the 1975 Waste Framework Directive, the European Commission indicated its wish to see progress in relation to landfill sites which had not been subject to the regulatory approach provided for in the Directive in the period to the enactment of the Waste Management Act in 1996.  In the context of Ireland&rsquo;s formal response <Col N="843"/>to the judgement, prepared in consultation with the EPA and other relevant bodies, a systematic approach is being applied to dealing with these historic or legacy sites.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that there are a number of different categories of landfill including currently operating licensed local authority landfills, local authority landfills that operated for a period as licensed landfills under the licensing regime established by the 1996 Act, but are now closed, and local authority landfills which were never licensed, but which operated during their lifetime within the then national legal arrangements.</P>
        <P>In regard to currently operating licensed facilities it is a matter for the local authority concerned to determine a gate fee which has regard to the costs of operating the facility and of meeting the aftercare provisions contained in the relevant EPA waste licence. However, the Government recognises that local authorities will face major challenges in meeting the costs of necessary remediation works in respect of closed facilities for which financial provision was not made during their operation. In 2006 my Department provided an initial &euro;10 million to assist certain local authorities to begin the remediation process in regard to sites which, while closed, had been the subject of a licence and as a consequence have determined aftercare requirements.</P>
        <P>In the context of the preparation of the new NDP my Department has proposed additional funding for the period 2007-2013 to permit continued phased remediation of the local authority landfill legacy on the basis of co-funding with the local authorities concerned. As each such site, not previously licensed, will be required to undergo a risk assessment, a statutory requirement under the EPA Act, all funding will be allocated on the basis of these assessments. In September 2006 I approved a draft Code of Practice for the Environmental Risk Assessment of Unregulated Waste Disposal Sites prepared by the EPA, on which the Agency then carried out a public consultation. During 2007 this Code will be used to begin the process of systematically assessing the historic landfills concerned to permit a coherent and uniform approach to addressing remediation requirements and funding.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s National Water Study audited 91 water supply schemes outside the Greater Dublin Area serving more than 5,000 consumers and operated by some 38 local authorities.  The study reported on all aspects of water supply, including availability of raw water, treatment capacity, water distribution systems and associated management issues. The study report published in 2000 found, inter alia, that unaccounted for water levels varied significantly between regions but were generally in the range of between 40% to 50%.   The corresponding figure in the Dublin region in 1996 was 42.5%.</P>
        <P>There are variations in the production costs of water between local authorities.  In addition, not all unaccounted for water is lost through leakage. Heretofore, a significant proportion would have related to unauthorised or unrecorded connections. However, the universal metering of all non-domestic consumers, which is expected to be completed in 2007, coupled with ongoing improvements in local authorities&rsquo; water management systems, will, in addition to further reducing unaccounted for water levels, significantly improve the range of data available in this area.  In the meantime, detailed information in relation to the cost of water leakage nationally is not available in my Department.</P>
        <P>In 1996 capital funding was introduced under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme to help reduce unaccounted for water levels in local authority distribution networks, to improve the quality of supply to consumers, to lower operating costs and to maximise the value of investment in new treatment works.  A series of pilot schemes to identify potential improvements, as well as some network rehabilitation, was undertaken. Project locations included Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Athlone and Clonmel.   Capital funding of &euro;63m was provided by my Department. The results showed that the levels of unaccounted for water were reduced considerably.  For example, in Dublin they fell from 42.5% to 28.7%, in Donegal from 59% to 39%, in Meath from 47% to 34% and in Kilkenny from 45% to 29%.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;281m is now available to local authorities to identify and reduce unaccounted for water in public supply networks.  The bulk of this allocation, &euro;194m, is for network rehabilitation or <Col N="846"/>replacement works by authorities that have already carried out water management system studies under the earlier pilot phase.  The balance of &euro;87m will enable the remaining authorities to complete water management system studies as a necessary precursor to structural rehabilitation works.  In November 2005, I increased the recoupment available to local authorities from my Department for certain water conservation activities from 75% to 90% to encourage and facilitate greater progress on water conservation generally.   Details of current allocations to individual authorities for water conservation measures are set out in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

	<P>The voluntary and co-operative housing sector has an important role in the provision of social housing.  By working in close partnership with local authorities, it supplements the social housing effort in areas where particular housing needs have been identified.  It is supported by my Department through two separate funding schemes, the Capital Assistance Scheme and the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme.</P>
        <P>The main strategy for delivery of the Government&rsquo;s social and affordable housing programme is through the local authority 5-year Action Plans for social and affordable housing. The Action Plans, now at their midway stage are currently being reviewed. The reviews are focussing on examining how targets have been met in the first two years of the plan and on incorporating any adjustments required for the remaining years of the plan, in light of outcomes including expected 2006 outputs, and the results of the recent Housing Needs Assessment. To date, over 19,000 units have been provided by the Voluntary Sector, some 8,000 of which have been provided over the period 2000-2005.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to providing additional investment over the period 2007-2009 in order to ensure the delivery of an additional 1,000 housing units.  In accordance with the policy objectives contained in the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016 my Department is actively engaging with the Voluntary and Co-operative Sector to ensure that the necessary supports and resources are in place to enable it to deliver on needs. Proposals are also being advanced for an early rationalisation of the administrative and <Col N="847"/>funding arrangements with a view to ensuring the earliest possible delivery of projects.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>I have noted the recent launch of the MakeRoom campaign by Focus Ireland, the Simon Communities of Ireland, the Society of St Vincent de Paul and Threshold. The stated aim of the MakeRoom campaign is to end homelessness by 2010 and in this context indicates this to mean &ldquo;nobody will sleep rough; nobody will stay in emergency accommodation for longer than is absolutely necessary and nobody will become homeless because of a lack of appropriate services&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The social partnership agreement Towards 2016 contains a commitment to the elimination of the long-term occupancy of emergency homeless <Col N="848"/>accommodation by 2010.  This is well aligned with the goals of the MakeRoom campaign. It should also be noted that the Homeless Agency, which is the partnership body which coordinates homeless services in Dublin, has already defined as its overarching goal the elimination of long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough in Dublin by 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Independent Review of Implementation of Homeless Strategies, published earlier this year, examined the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Integrated and Preventative Homeless Strategies and concluded that they should be amalgamated and updated. The Government have accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Review and work is under way on the preparation of a revised and updated Strategy on Homelessness. As part of this process, a National Homeless Consultative Committee, including representatives from homeless service providers, will be established to provide input into the development of the revised homeless strategy and ongoing government policy on addressing homelessness.  Very significant resources are being made available to address the issue of homelessness at national level in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner.  Since 2000, the Government through my Department and the Department of Health and Children have provided over &euro;450 million in capital and current funding nationally for the provision of accommodation and care related services for homeless persons.</P>
        <P>Recent assessments indicate that there has been a welcome decrease in rough sleeping in Dublin over recent years. According to Counted In 2002, the assessment of homelessness in the Dublin area undertaken by the Homeless Agency in March 2002, 312 people self-reported that they had slept rough for four nights or more in the previous week. The number of persons self-reporting as having slept rough for four nights or more in the most recent assessment, Counted In 2005, undertaken by the Homeless Agency in March 2005, was 185 &mdash; a decrease of 40%.</P>
        <P>In relation to the overall number of homeless persons in Dublin, Counted In 2005 recorded that the number of homeless households in the Dublin area was 1,361 comprising some 2,015 persons and this represented a 19% reduction in the number of homeless households since the 2002 assessment. This was comparable with the experience of the Dublin Homeless Persons Unit which saw a 20% decrease in the number of households presenting as homeless in the same period.</P>
        <P>Nationally, through the vital work of the local homeless fora, there has also been significant progress in reducing the numbers of homeless persons. In the Housing Needs Assessment 2005, local authorities recorded a 46% fall in the numbers of homeless persons nationally, from 5,581 persons in 2002 to 3,031 persons in 2005. In <Col N="849"/>terms of rough sleeping, local authorities reported some 41 people sleeping rough outside of the Dublin area in the Housing Needs Assessment. Including the 185 people sleeping rough reported in the Dublin area, this would indicate that there were 226 people sleeping rough nationally in March 2005.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 107 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland is experiencing huge levels of population growth across all counties, with the national population rising by over 8% in the last four years alone.  This unparalleled growth, together with unprecedented economic expansion have placed large demands on housing and associated infrastructures.  This represents a new challenge for the regional balance of development across the country, and for dealing with increasing pressures in the urban environs of Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Government has acted swiftly and on a broad front to ensure that the provision of new houses and apartments is undertaken in a manner that is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable.  A key policy response has been the National Spatial Strategy (NSS), which was published in November 2002.</P>
        <P>The NSS calls for a more balanced spread of economic activity in Ireland, but recognises that we must support and enhance the competitiveness of the Greater Dublin Area so that it continues to perform at the international and national level as a driver of national development.  The NSS also accepts that it is not sustainable that Dublin should continue to spread outwards into counties on its periphery and beyond.  To address this, the Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs) for the Greater Dublin Area <Col N="850"/>emphasise that it is necessary to consolidate the physical growth of the Dublin metropolitan area, the city and suburbs, while at the same time concentrating development in the hinterland into strategically placed, strong and dynamic urban centres.</P>
        <P>The principles of the RPGs are now reflected in city and county development plans in the Greater Dublin Area and the effects of these policies are being seen in more integrated and strategic planning policies at local level.  Moreover, the 1999 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density included specific objectives for more compact urban development by seeking to assist planning authorities in achieving high quality residential density at appropriate locations, in conjunction with improved public transport systems.  These guidelines are currently being reviewed and updated to take account of changing population and settlement patterns and the extensive experience built up since the introduction of the 1999 guidelines in the design, assessment and development of higher density proposals.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the continuing implementation of the policies outlined above will have a positive influence on bringing about more compact urban design and sustainable development into the future.</P>

        <P>In continued recognition of the interaction between the environment and human health, formal links have been established between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health Services Executive.  This has resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding between the two bodies, signed in October 2006, affirming their commitment to on-going cooperation, in the interest of the protection of health and the environment.  The Agency has also advertised for a Post Doctoral Research Fellow in its Environmental Research Centre whose remit will include developing a framework and initiatives to advance the interface between environmental protection and human health protection.</P>

	<P>Under the Waste Management Acts, responsibility for the determination and implementation of waste management plans rests with the local authority (or local authorities) concerned and my Department has no direct involvement. Thermal treatment with energy recovery in accordance with the internationally accepted waste management hierarchy is a key element of Irish waste management policy and this is reflected in the relevant regional waste management plans.</P>
        <P>The identification and delivery of necessary waste infrastructure, including waste to energy plants, is a matter for the local authorities in each region and the private sector.

	<P>There are many complementary elements within the National Spatial Strategy and its equivalent in Northern Ireland &mdash; the Regional Development Strategy.  These include the recognition of the attractiveness for inward investment of the Dublin-Belfast corridor and the role of the Letterkenny-Derry gateway as a driver for the wider northwest region.  Both Governments have been actively supporting ongoing capital investments and spatial planning initiatives to implement those complementary and interdependent elements of both spatial strategies such as the M1-A1 road link, the Newry-Dundalk Twin City Initiative and the Northwest Gateway Initiative.</P>
        <P>Recognising that there is further potential to strengthen co-operation in implementing both spatial strategies on the island, my Department, working in conjunction with the Department of Regional Development in Northern Ireland, is preparing a non-statutory framework for collaborative action on spatial policy between the National Spatial Strategy and the Regional Development Strategy for Northern Ireland.  This was endorsed by the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and was announced in a joint communiqu&eacute; following the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference last May.</P>
        <P>The aim of the collaborative framework is to facilitate strategic, forward-looking spatial planning and appropriate investment in infrastructure which will help to create enhanced, globally competitive and dynamic economic conditions on the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>To support the development of the collaborative framework, InterTrade Ireland commissioned the International Centre for Local and Regional Development (ICLRD) to carry out a study aimed at identifying the best means of taking the project forward.  ICLRD is a consortium involving NUI Maynooth, the University of Ulster and Harvard College.  The study, titled Spatial Strategies for the Island of Ireland towards a Collaborative Approach, was formally launched at a conference in Newry on 9 November.</P><Col N="857"/>

        <P>The maximum loan which may be advanced by a local authority for social and affordable housing schemes is &euro;185,000 and subject to this limit, a loan of up to 95% of the price of the house may be made available.  It is a matter for local authorities to determine the amount on the loan in each case up to the limit and subject to the borrower&rsquo;s ability to repay. In order to ensure the optimal use of resources, the prioritisation of funding for lower income groups and to avoid any significant impact on house process in their areas, authorities may apply lower limits to reflect local market conditions.</P>

	<P>The Review of Local Government Financing by Indecon Economic Consultants estimated, on the basis of different methods of projecting expenditure, that by 2010 local authority expenditure would increase by &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion in nominal terms over 2004 levels.</P><Col N="859"/>
        <P>Funding this expenditure would be met by a combination of the buoyancy in the existing funding system, some additional funding and the achievement of efficiencies over the period.</P>
        <P>As regards the existing funding system, there is significant natural buoyancy in the current revenue sources of local authorities. The valuation bases of local authorities are growing substantially as a result of continued economic growth. In addition revenue from motor taxation &mdash; which is paid directly into the Local Government Fund &mdash; continues to increase without any increases in the rates of this taxation; in 2006, motor tax revenues are running at 10% above 2005 levels.</P>
        <P>I was in a position to announce record levels of General-Purpose Grants to local authorities from the Fund amounting to some &euro;875m for 2006. Taking account of global valuations, this was an increase of some 8% on the 2005 allocation or 2&frac12; times the 1997 level.   I am also increasing the general-purpose grant allocations to local authorities for 2007 by 8% and I am confident that this level of funding will be adequate to meet ongoing local authority needs.</P>
        <P>To supplement the existing income sources, a number of initiatives are being pursued.  In the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Bill 2006, which is before this House today, I am making new commercial properties liable to a levy, similar to rates, effective from the date that the valuation of the property is placed on the valuation list, rather than from the commencement of the next rating year as is the case at present.   Measures to combat motor tax evasion are being continued and stepped up. I am also considering ways of bringing planning fees, which are fixed by Regulations, into line with the economic cost of dealing with planning applications.</P>
        <P>Additional revenues will be complemented by a range of efficiency initiatives.  In partnership with local authorities:</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />I am developing a standard costing system for the sector to deliver enhanced management information, particularly in relation to unit costs,</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />In the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Bill 2006, I am proposing to enhance the arrangements for local audit committees in line with best practice, and</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />I will pursue the scope for greater sharing of services between authorities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will also continue to ensure that the Value for Money Unit in my Department undertakes in-depth analyses of local authority activities and identifies &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;.</P><Col N="860"/>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Development contributions allow local authorities to recoup some of the costs to public funds of servicing land for private development.  Without them, this servicing could not proceed or the full cost would have to be borne by the taxpayer. They are also a way of recouping some of the &ldquo;betterment&rdquo;, which local authorities add to the value of land when it is serviced.</P>
        <P>Under the Planning Acts, the money is ring fenced to pay for facilities servicing new development, for example, roads, water and sewerage services and other amenities including community facilities, landscaping and public transport infrastructure provided by or on behalf of a planning authority.</P>
        <P>Development contributions are imposed on all types of new development that relies on the services mentioned in particular, housing.  Development contributions are attached as a condition of planning permission, and are therefore paid by the person carrying out the development in advance of construction starting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Affordable homes attract development contributions, as such homes are private homes, but sold at a discount to the market value and subject to a claw back on re-sale.  The claw back provision is in place to protect the State&rsquo;s interest in the house and to ensure that there is no short-term profit taking on the resale of an affordable house.  It is not proposed to exempt such houses from the requirement of development contributions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 534 together.</P>
        <P>My Department introduced a programme in July 2004 for the installation of central heating in existing local authority rented dwellings with priority given to houses occupied by elderly people.  Grants totalling some &euro;42 million were paid to local authorities by my Department in 2004 and 2005. Capital allocations of almost &euro;32 million were notified to local authorities for 2006.  The following table gives a breakdown of the funding provided and allocated by local authority under the Central Heating Programme.</P>
        <P>Prior to this initiative, my Department has required since 1994 that central heating be provided during construction in new local authority dwellings and included in the overall cost of schemes.

        <P>More generally, the management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the installation of central heating is, in general, the responsibility of local authorities to be financed from their own resources.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>In February 2005, I announced a Fire Services Change Programme to implement the key fire services and fire safety recommendations of the Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland. This Programme includes measures addressing the development of community fire safety programmes and the development of a competency based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression in the fire services. A number of community fire safety programmes are now being implemented including schemes aimed at increasing smoke alarm ownership and an educational programme for primary school children.</P>
        <P>First Responder Training has been provided to fire-fighters by individual fire authorities over the last five years, with most fire authorities having completed this training. First Responder Training is being considered as a standard module for inclusion in the recruit programme being developed under the competency element of the Fire Service Change Programme.</P>

	<P>Draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans were published for public consultation last April.  The draft Guidelines aim to ensure that all development plans are prepared to the highest possible standards on a consistent basis across planning authorities in terms of setting clear aims and objectives. This includes the process of drafting, public consultation, presentation and adoption of plans.   The draft Guidelines also emphasise the importance within such plans of creating a clear strategic framework for the proper planning and sustainable development of the relevant area consistent with the longer-term aims set out in the National Spatial Strategy and regional planning guidelines.</P>
        <P>The draft guidelines flesh out the role and nature of high quality development plans in terms of:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />their need to be strategic;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />their role as a catalyst for positive change and progress;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />their objective anticipation of future needs;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />their role in protecting the environment and heritage;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />their consistency with other plans and policies;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />their need to address diverse community needs; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />their broad ownership by elected members, sectoral interests and the community.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Other key issues addressed in the draft Guidelines is the format of development plans and the need for continuous monitoring and evaluation of their implementation, and the key role that elected members play in the overall process.  Comments and submissions received during the public consultation period are currently being considered by my Department with a view to finalising the Guidelines early in the new year.</P>

	<P>Significant powers are available to local authorities and to individuals to deal with environmental noise issues.  I am also aware from the recent Second Stage debate on the Noise Bill 2006 of a shared concern to ensure that legislation in this area is adequate and to strengthen existing provisions if that is found to be necessary.  The Government did not oppose the Bill and the sufficiency of existing measures will therefore be the subject of further examination in Committee in due course.</P>

	<P>Ready, Steady Play: A National Play Policy, which was published in 2004, provides a framework for the development of public play facilities in Ireland, with the overall aim of ensuring that children have access to a range of quality play opportunities to enrich their childhood.   As part of the implementation of this policy, my Department has allocated funding of over &euro;8 million to County and City Councils for the development of new, or refurbishment of existing, playgrounds <Col N="869"/>over the period 2004-2006.  The location of the playgrounds which benefit from these moneys is a matter for the local authority to decide.</P>
        <P>In May 2005, I introduced a new initiative for the provision of skateboard facilities by local authorities.  Each City and County Council was invited to submit expressions of interest for grant assistance towards the provision of a skateboard park in its area.  Applications were assessed in my Department in conjunction with the National Children&rsquo;s Office and some 21 projects in 21 different local authority areas were recommended for grant aid.  A sum of &euro;1 million had initially been earmarked for the scheme in 2005 but, in light of the number and quality of submissions received, I approved all 21 projects in November 2005 and increased the funding allocation to over &euro;2 million which is expected to be spent over a two year period.</P>
        <P>The position regarding the provision of the 21 approved projects is being monitored by my Department and the question of inviting further proposals from local authorities will be kept under review in the light of progress with the 2005 scheme.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There has been significant progress in recovery and recycling of waste in Ireland in recent years.  The Government policy document Waste Management: &mdash; Changing Our Ways (1998) set a target of 35% recycling for municipal waste by 2013.  The EPA&rsquo;s National Waste Report 2004 shows that the recycling rate for municipal waste in that year was 32.6%.  In addition, the diversion of household waste now stands at 19.5%, up from 3.2% in 1998 while the recovery rate for C&amp;D waste is reported as a provisional 85.2% equating to an estimated 9,513,962 tonnes.</P>
        <P>Increases in recycling have been achieved as a result of a range of policies introduced and supported by my Department including the provision of recycling facilities, 1929 brings banks and 69 civic amenity sites, the roll-out of segregated waste collection services, greater use of pay-by-use charging for waste management services and awareness raising measures such as the Race Against Waste.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003, primary responsibility for developing and implementing responses to litter lies with local authorities.  Local authorities are required, so far as is practicable, to ensure that public roads in their functional areas are kept free of litter.  They are also required to take all practicable measures for the prevention, control and disposal of litter in their functional areas.</P>
        <P>Each local authority determines its level of expenditure on individual local services, including anti-litter and clean-up operations.  Statistics available to my Department show that local authorities have substantially increased expenditure on road/street cleaning services.  In 2005 local authorities spent &euro;74 million on road/street cleaning, compared to &euro;43 million in 2000 &mdash; an increase of 72%.</P>
        <P>To support more effective local authority action against litter my Department has allocated over &euro;5.7 million since 1997 to local authorities for public education and awareness initiatives against litter.  My Department also provides financial support for two national anti-litter initiatives i.e. the An Taisce-led project, National Spring Clean and the Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) National Litter League, and has developed the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System (NLPMS) currently being <Col N="872"/>implemented by local authorities.  The NLPMS, which measures the extent and severity of litter pollution nationally, shows that there has been an improvement in litter pollution levels countrywide in recent years.  The positive trend shown by the Monitoring System is also reflected in the IBAL League results, which record that cleanliness levels in the 53 participating towns and cities are generally improving.</P>
        <P>Litter enforcement statistics are available in the Oireachtas Library and show that local authority performance on enforcement of the litter laws continues to improve.  More litter wardens have been employed and there have been substantial increases in the number of prosecutions taken and on-the-spot fines issued annually.</P>
        <P>Under the Waste Management Act 1996 persons holding, transporting recovering or disposing of waste may not do so in a manner which causes, or is likely to cause, environmental pollution.  Enforcement is a matter for the local authorities and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement.</P>
        <P>My Department has provided &euro;7.5 million this year to local authorities from the Environment Fund, to assist them in their waste enforcement activities generally.  The funding is part of a programme of additional law enforcement in relation to waste activities.  The purpose of the grant assistance is to provide highly visible on-the-ground enforcement staff and to help create a culture of compliance.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that existing anti-litter actions and waste enforcement activities by local authorities, together with my Department&rsquo;s support for the above initiatives, provide an effective and appropriate basis for tackling litter pollution and illegal dumping nationally.</P>

	<P>Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local <Col N="874"/>authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  However, my Department has asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors to agree on arrangements to assist lower income households by offering alternatives to periodic lump-sum payments.</P>
        <P>In August this year, I published a consultation paper on options for future regulation of the waste sector. Submissions were invited on whether there is a need for a regulator for the sector, if so on what model of regulator might be most appropriate and on what powers any such regulator should be given. Among the possible powers discussed in the paper is the power to impose a public service obligation so that services can be provided where they would not otherwise be economically feasible. Following consideration of the submissions received, which is currently under way, I intend to finalise further policy proposals.</P>

	<P>My Department funds comprehensive range of grants and subsidies which are available from local authorities under the devolved Rural Water Programme to bring quality deficient group water schemes up to a satisfactory standard. These include including a 100% capital grant for new water treatment and disinfection plants.</P>
        <P>Last February, I announced a capital allocation of &euro;133m for the 2006 Rural Water Programme, the biggest ever annual allocation for the Programme.  The bulk of this funding was earmarked for the provision of water treatment and disinfection facilities for group schemes with quality deficient sources.  Upgrading projects are now being progressed for 282 group schemes throughout the county.  By the end of this year, some 100 new water treatment plants will be operational and delivering treated water to over 26,000 rural households.  New treatment projects to serve a further 17,000 rural consumers have been advanced through the planning stages and construction has already commenced on a number of these.  Group scheme connections to local authority public water supply networks will benefit up to 10,000 more rural households.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Priority Question No. 46 on today&rsquo;s question paper.</P>
        <P>The increase in development contributions in recent years reflects the large rise in construction activity which has led in its turn to increased demands for infrastructure, a fairer application of contributions across all development sectors and more accurate estimates by local authorities of their anticipated expenditure on infrastructure works; the latter is a requirement in advance of adopting a development contribution scheme under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  In addition the 2000 Act for the first time provided that development contributions could be levied for local community infrastructure, such as playgrounds and parks.</P>
        <P>The following tables set out the development contributions collected by planning authorities for the period 1983 to 2005.  My Department does not have figures for development contributions collected prior to 1983.</P><Col N="875"/>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the anomalous situation contained in the Building Control Bill 2005 as amended at committee stage whereby persons who receive the qualification MRIAI after the Bill comes into force will be recognised in Europe but not here and persons who do not hold that qualification will be able to practice here but will not be recognised under the European Architects&rsquo; Directive. </Quest>
        <QRef>[42459/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 12 of the Building Control Bill 2005, as amended at Committee Stage, sets out a number of ways in which a person may be eligible for registration as an Architect. These include academic and practical experience options. It also provides that a person who is a fellow or member of the registration body (RIAI) on the date of the passing of the Act will automatically be eligible for registration. Persons who become members of RIAI subsequent to that date may apply for registration under the alternative routes provided for in the Bill. </P>
        <P>The Architects Directive 85/384/EEC now incorporated in Directive 2005/36/EU on Mutual Recognition of Qualifications recognises graduates in Architecture from UCD and DIT together with &ldquo;membership&rdquo; or &ldquo;associate membership&rdquo; of the RIAI.</P>
        <P>The Report by the Competition Authority on Competition in Professional Services (Architects) recommended that, following enactment of the Bill, an amendment should be sought to Directive 2005/36/EU, referred to above to provide that the existing criteria (in Annex V) of &ldquo;membership&rdquo; or &ldquo;associated membership&rdquo; of the RIAI be replaced with &ldquo;registration&rdquo; by the registration body.  This would entitle all persons registered in the statutory register to recognition in the European Union, should the amendment be accepted. I would propose to seek such an amendment following enactment of the Bill.</P><Col N="884"/>
        <P>It should be noted that Section 12 of the Bill also provides that all registered professionals are eligible for membership of the registration body. Pending an amendment of the Directive 2005/36/EU (Recognition of Professional Qualifications), this provision would enable registered Architects who are not graduates of UCD or DIT, to be registered under the Directive.</P>

	<P>By any objective standard, there has been remarkable progress over the lifetime of this Government in relation to the protection and improvement of water quality. This progress includes &mdash; </P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />since 2000 an increase in waste water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a populations of 3.1 million</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />since 1997 an increase from 20% to 90% in the level of compliance with the relevant EU Directive on waste water treatment</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />an increase from 67% to 70% in the length of unpolluted river channel between 1997 and 2003: this represents the first reversal of a downward decline that had persisted for decades</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />more Blue Flag beaches: in 2006, 81 Blue Flags were awarded to Irish bathing areas: this is the highest number ever, and compares with 70 in 1997</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />massive investment and rapid progress in the elimination of substandard drinking water supplies in the group scheme sector.</P><Col N="885"/>
        <P FLI="0">These achievements in relation to our water quality standards will continue to be supported by large scale investment under the Water Services Investment Programme and by implementation of the Nitrates Action Programme.</P>
        <P>Every implementation deadline set to date by the Water Framework Directive have been achieved on time by Ireland. My Department provides 100% funding for river basin management projects to support implementation of the Water Framework Directive and has committed over &euro;68 million for this purpose.  INTERREG funding is also available in relation to cross-border projects. The river basin management plans, which are being developed for adoption by 2009, will set out the specific environmental objectives to be achieved together with a programme of measures to deliver those objectives by the deadline of 2015. I am satisfied with the progress made so far in implementing the Directive and I expect that we will continue to see significant improvements in the quality of our fresh and coastal water resources, which will be reflected in EPA and EEA Water Quality Reports over the coming years.</P>

	<P>Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level.  To date, the European Union has adopted two directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).  Ratification of the Convention will take place after these Directives have been transposed into Irish Law.</P>
        <P>Work is continuing in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with regard to the transposition of these two Directives and will be completed as soon as possible.  When the above work on transposition is completed, the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention will be submitted to Government and laid before the D&aacute;il.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of legislative measures have been put in place to ensure that local authorities have the capacity to fulfil their responsibilities under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock.  These measures are kept under continuous review in my Department. </P>
        <P>The tenancy agreement, which is the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions in relation to behaviour which is acceptable and that which is not. The local authority is empowered under section 62 of the Housing Act 1966, to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of the tenancy agreement.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 is to provide for a range of measures to assist local authorities in addressing problems arising on their estates from drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour. The Act gives recognition to the role of local authorities in actively promoting the interests of tenants and other occupiers in their housing estates and also in working towards the avoidance, prevention and abatement of anti-social behaviour. One of the main provisions of the 1997 Act enables a local authority tenant, or the local authority itself in certain circumstances, to apply to the District Court for an excluding order against an individual member of the household who is believed to be engaging in anti-social behaviour. The measures contained in the 1997 Act are essential to ensure that local authorities have the capacity to take effective action in this area.</P>
        <P>In fulfilment of commitments in the Housing Policy statement &mdash; Building Sustainable Communities, I am reviewing the provisions of this Act with a view to strengthening their powers.</P>
        <P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 contains a number of provisions to address the issue of anti-social behaviour in private rented accommodation and also extends the local authority <Col N="889"/>power to obtain excluding orders in respect of the occupants (other than the owner) of tenant purchased houses.  It also extends the local authority power to refuse to sell a house to a person under the Tenant Purchase Scheme it has reason to believe may engage in anti-social behaviour to the Shared Ownership Scheme, the Affordable Housing Scheme and affordable houses deriving from Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Centre for Housing Research, which is funded by my Department and local authorities, has produced good practice guidelines on preventing and combating anti-social behaviour.  The Centre has also organised training courses for local authorities in this regard.  In this wider context, my Department has put in place a Housing Management Initiatives scheme which includes funding for programmes to improve estate management, tenant liaison and training initiatives.</P>
        <P>Further issues, including matters of a criminal nature, come within the remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Data on the number of social houses delivered in each local authority for each year, and for the first 6 months of 2006, are published in the Housing Statistics Bulletins, which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.</P>
        <P>From 2000 to 2003, the local authority four-year multi-annual programme included target starts over the whole period for authorities on their main construction and acquisitions programme. However, this programme did not include targets for other social housing options. Details of the programme at individual local authority level are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>In 2004, building on the positive experiences from the multi-annual approach to the local auth<Col N="890"/>ority housing construction programme, I requested local authorities to set about the preparation of action plans to cover all aspects of social and affordable housing. This initiative provided a framework for the integrated and cohesive planning and delivery over the following years of specific social and affordable housing measures in each local authority area.  The action plans were based on the overall analysis of need as established by the local authority housing strategy, and outlined the proposed response in terms of new social and affordable housing, addressing regeneration and remedial works together with the proposed arrangements for management and maintenance of the stock.   Details of the Action Plans are published on individual local authorities&rsquo; websites.</P>
        <P>On agreeing the Action Plans with each local authority I provided for a mid-term review to be carried out this year.  The review is now nearing completion and the report will be made available on my Department&rsquo;s website in due course.  It has focused on examining how targets have been met in the first two years of the plan and on incorporating any adjustments required for the remaining years of the plan, in light of outcomes including expected 2006 outputs, and the results of the recent Housing Needs Assessment. Officials from my Department met with each local authority to discuss progress, including identifying reasons for under performance where relevant.</P>
        <P>Authorities which did not reach their planned activity in 2004 and 2005, have generally revised targets for 2006 to 2008 to achieve the same overall output over the five year period.</P>
        <P>My Department and local authorities both agree that the process of developing housing action plans is very beneficial and it is proposed to continue using the process as the main strategy for delivery of social and affordable housing.</P>

        <Quest> the details of research, correspondence or advice that his Department has received relating to the possibility that different measurements resulting from the use of the overall heat loss method and the elemental method of measuring compliance with Part L may be leading to different outcomes depending on the method used. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the Question refers to a report (30 May 2006) by the UK based Building Research Establishment (BRE). The report sets out a calculated comparison of the above two methods of achieving compliance with Part L for a small sample of two English dwellings. My attention was drawn to this <Col N="891"/>report in correspondence from the timber frame manufacturer who commissioned it.</P>
        <P>In its conclusion, the BRE report claims that houses built to comply with the elemental method will use about 30% less energy for space heating than those complying with the Overall Heat Loss (OHL) method.</P>
        <P>My technical advice is that the two methods referred to in the Question undoubtedly give different results. The differences depend on the type, size and shape of the building and on the actual areas of the main external elements, i.e. roofs, walls, floors, windows and doors. However, I am advised that the differences between the two methods should be significantly less than claimed for the two English examples. The BRE Report does not contain sufficient information to allow independent review and validation of its assumptions and calculations.</P>
        <P>The May 2006 edition of Technical Guidance Document L includes both methods of demonstrating compliance with Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations. The primary reason for allowing both methods is to provide options for:</P><Col N="892"/>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />some flexibility in how heat loss through the building fabric is limited, via the  OHL method, and</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a simple method &mdash; the Elemental method &mdash; of demonstrating compliance which suits those who do not wish to deal with the complexity of additional calculations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Part L standards for Dwellings are due for revision in 2008 at the latest, as required under the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. In this context, the appropriateness of continuing the two methods will be considered.</P>

This is provided from a number of sources including the Exchequer, the European Regional Development Fund and the Environment Fund, and is normally on the basis <Col N="898"/>of my Department meeting 75% of the cost and the relevant local authority funding the balance.</P>
        <P>Projects for which grants have been allocated can take a number of years to complete as they go through the various project stages, e.g. design, planning, construction, and consequently claims will be submitted and monies paid typically over a number of years. In 2006, in respect of projects for which moneys have been drawn down from the Environment Fund, a total grant allocation of &euro;11,813,836 has been provided by my Department.</P>

	<P>On 29 November, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights published their Final Report into the Bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in  Dundalk in 1975. This is the last of Judge Barron&rsquo;s Reports to be considered by the Committee. </P>
        <P FLI="0">The findings in this Report are deeply troubling and a matter of most serious concern.  They paint a very disturbing picture. The Joint Oireachtas Committee has called for a full debate in the D&aacute;il and Seanad on collusion, which I support.</P>
        <P>I have consistently raised the issue of collusion with the British Government. I again raised it with Prime Minister Blair when I met him on 4 December in London.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear that I want the British Government to examine the findings of all of these reports, as well as the forthcoming MacEntee Report. I appreciate that there are many issues on all sides arising from the past but I have consistently emphasised, and I believe Prime Minister Blair understands, the very deep anxiety and widespread concerns arising from these reports and the need for the British Government to play its part in addressing these concerns.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 to 184, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Written Questions No. 132 to 136 from Deputy Rabbitte on 5 July, 2006, Written Question No. 221 from Deputy Gormley on 27 September, 2006, Written Questions Nos. 177 and 178 from Deputy Sargent on 14 November, 2006 and Written Questions Nos. 165 to 169 from Deputy Allen on 28 November, 2006.</P>
        <P>The Assistant Parliamentary Counsel (Grade II) competition was organised on behalf of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government by the Public Appointments Service.  Neither the Office nor the Public Appointments Service have been informed of any unhappiness in relation to the running of the competition or its outcome.  There is absolutely no question of any applicant being branded a failure.</P>
        <P>The original sanction from the Department of Finance did specify that, based on the Government&rsquo;s decision on Public Service numbers, any increase in permanent positions would have to be offset by a reduction in contract positions.</P><Col N="901"/>
        <P>The 2006 competition to recruit Advisory Counsel (Grade III) staff attracted 48 applicants, of whom 21 were shortlisted for interview, 18 presented themselves for interview and 9 of these were placed on a panel. Six have taken up duty to date.</P>
        <P>In the course of previous replies, I pointed out that many drafting projects are undertaken by more than one drafter.  Contract drafters, like permanent staff, collaborate with colleagues in training and peer review of draft legislation.  It would not be possible to give an accurate figure as to how many Acts of the Oireachtas contract staff drafted in whole or in part.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government does not accept that there is a morale problem in the Office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have no function in the regulation of broadcast media but can advise him as to the child protection arrangements in place in respect of a number of other media formats.  Insofar as Films and Video/DVD are concerned, the position is that these must be classified by the Irish Film Censor for sale, exhibition or rental. The age appropriateness of each work is then displayed in cinemas and all video/DVD works must carry the age classification on the packaging and tape/ DVD.</P>
        <P>With regard to video games, the position is that Ireland is a member of the Pan European Games Information (PEGI) system.  Video games are classified by age appropriateness at the following levels; 3+: 7+ 12+; 15+ and 18+.  The categorisation is then indicated on product packaging.  Under these arrangements, video games are categorised according to a robust and consistent system and subject to independent non-industry verification.</P>
        <P>A key component of both the Film/DVD and video game arrangements is that the classification systems are designed to provide useful information as to the content of the product.  In particular, the intention is to assist parents in making informed choices concerning the media they acquire for their children or which they permit their children to use.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that Internet access has expanded considerably in recent years and that developments in communications technologies now allow for internet access by new means.   This is a largely positive development but, by its very nature as an international phenomenon with no single controlling authority, the internet presents challenges for those charged with combatting its illegal or harmful use.</P>
        <P>With this in mind, an Internet Advisory Board (IAB) was established in Ireland in February 2000.  As well as overseeing a self-regulatory regime for the Irish Internet Service Providers, it encourages best practice procedures, provides advice to parents and others and facilitates research on internet-related issues including child safety.  My Department provides secretarial and other supports for the Board&rsquo;s work.  Combatting illegal, harmful and predatory use of the Internet requires responses at national, EU and international levels and Ireland is fully committed to playing its part at home and internationally on all of these fronts.</P>
        <P>Steps taken within Ireland to date include the introduction of a hotline (www.hotline.ie) which accepts and investigates reports from the public in relation to child pornography and other illegal material on the Internet, as well as an industry Code of Practice and Ethics setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet Service Provider.  The Irish Code of Practice and Ethics is recognised throughout Europe as a model of its <Col N="904"/>type.  The IAB has also produced a very helpful booklet for parents which gives advice on how to recognise if a child is using new media technologies in a potentially dangerous way and what steps a parent can take to prevent or stop this.  The Deputy may also wish to note that, in its role of encouraging best practice and formulating advice, the IAB is currently evaluating the use of electronic technology which can be used to block access to specific websites and is preparing a report on this matter.</P>

	<P>The statutory requirements for naturalisation are set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  This provides that applicants for naturalisation, other than spouses of Irish citizens, must have been resident for five years of the nine year period prior to the date of application.  Resident in this context means residence for which the applicant had the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and where such permission was not granted for the purposes of study or seeking asylum.</P>
        <P>The average processing time for applications for certificates of naturalisation is approximately 24 months and this is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years.</P><Col N="909"/>
        <P>As the Deputy has not elaborated on any particular difficulties experienced by applicants or their families, I cannot respond fully to his question. However, I should point out that having Irish citizenship is not a prerequisite for accessing education in Ireland.</P>

In addition there are currently 19 IT contract staff working in the IT Section on foot of a contract which was awarded to Rescon Ltd in April, 2006 following an EU tender.  The annual cost of the contract is &euro;1,685,000.  The contract duration is for two years with the option to extend the contract for an additional year.  The contractors provide ongoing and essential IT services across both the system and infrastructure <Col N="914"/>sides of Information Communications Technology within the Prison Service. </P>
        <P>As part of the Civil Service wide HR Management System implementation, the Irish Prison Service decided to approve the development and implementation of a Human Resource Management System (PeopleSoft HRMS) in 2003. As the Deputy will be aware a decision was taken to suspend the usage of the system because of the difficulty in matching many of the business and operational requirements of the Prison Service at that time.   The IPS contribution to the developments of the suite of programmes was approximately &euro;557,000 which includes the purchase cost, implementation consultancy requirements, licences and necessary changes to the core system.</P>
        <P>In the interim, significant upgrading and customisation of the PeopleSoft HRMS and the IPS network infrastructure and architecture have taken place and &euro;60,787 has been spent on consultancy fees related to this development need.  During this time the IPS have developed an updated set of HR business needs and have been re-evaluating its options in respect of a Human Resources Information System.  The IPS is currently preparing to re-engage with Human Resources Information Systems providers with a view to progressing the implementation of a revised Human Resources System building on the work done on the original system and the updated set of HR business needs now to hand.</P>

        <Quest> if he will invoke Section 40 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and instruct the Garda Commissioner to provide all information and records relating to the contract assessment for the previous Garda video interview recording contract in view of the review carried out by the Information Commissioner which concluded that the records could now be provided if they were requested by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Section 40 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides that the Secretary General of my Department can request information, including documentation, from the Garda Commissioner as part of the process whereby the Garda Commissioner accounts to me as Minister and to the Government for his functions.</P>
        <P>The circumstances surrounding the Deputy&rsquo;s question arise from a Freedom of Information request to my Department for access to records created and held by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which as the Deputy appreciates is not subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts.  The Information Commissioner concluded in this case that the records in question were not held <Col N="915"/>by or under the control of my Department, and that therefore the requester did not have a right of access to them.  In coming to this conclusion, the Information Commissioner took into account the provisions of section 40.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the power on the part of the Secretary General under section 40 to request documents from the Garda Commissioner was ever intended to be exercised for the purpose of bringing Garda documents, which would otherwise lie outside the scope of the Freedom of Information Acts, into the possession of the Department so as thereby to bring them within that scope.  The right of access to the documents in question under the Freedom of Information Acts was very fully considered by the Information Commissioner, and her decision must be respected.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the subject matter of the documentation has already been reported on by the Comptroller and Auditor General and was examined by the Public Accounts Committee in 2003.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there has been no discernible increase in the number of anti-social/public disorder incidents in the Fethard area and the number remains small.  I am also informed that one Sergeant and one Garda are currently allocated to the Garda sub-district of Fethard. I am further informed that local Garda management has an initiative to address the issue of public disorder and other anti-social type behaviour in place in the Clonmel Garda District including the Fethard area, which includes high visibility patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel from the Clonmel District with additional patrols by the Divisional Traffic Corps targeting this type of criminality.</P>
        <P>In general I can inform the Deputy that strong provisions are in place to combat public order problems including anti-social behaviour.  The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.    The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to <Col N="916"/>excessive drinking.  The Act provides for the making of exclusion orders on individuals to prohibit that person from entering or being in the vicinity of specified premises between such times, and during such a period, as the Court may specify.  The Act also provides for the making of closure orders on specified premises, requiring that premises to close at a specified time or between specified times on a specified day or days during a specified period.  A closure order may also require a premises to close for a maximum of 7 days in respect of a first order or for a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 30 days in respect of a second order.  Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.</P>
        <P>More recently, I brought forward additional provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to deal with public order offences and anti-social behaviour. In the case of anti-social behaviour the Act empowers a senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner.</P>
        <P>Separate provision is being made in relation to young people.  The Act introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There will be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.  Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the courts.</P>
        <P>The provisions on anti-social behaviour of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 will be commenced soon, following the consultations required under the Act between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These consultations are currently ongoing. The purpose of this is to ensure that these provisions will commence as soon as the Commissioner has made the necessary internal arrangements to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.   The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency. </P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  An application for long term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in July 2006. I understand that applications received in May 2006 are currently being dealt with.</P>

	<P>I would like to inform the Deputy that there are a number of legislative, operational and administrative changes under way which will see the transfer of responsibility for the detention of young offenders under 18 years of age, ordered to be detained by the Courts, from the Department of Education and Science and the Irish Prison Service to the Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department.  The Irish Youth Justice Service has been established as an executive office of my Department and is to, <i>inter alia</i>, manage detention services for young people under the age of 18 years.</P><Col N="920"/>
        <P>The net effect of these reforms to the detention services will be to end the practice of using adult prison places for the detention of children.  It will also see the extension of the children detention school model to all offenders, male and female, under the age of 18 years.   This will require the construction of children detention school places, with the requisite facilities to provide care and education, which can accommodate all 16 and 17 year olds ordered to be detained by the Courts.  The legislation, once commenced, includes arrangements for the use of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution on an interim basis. To facilitate this, work is well underway in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution for the separation of the majority of those under the age of 18 years from the older age groups.</P>
        <P>The transfer of the children detention schools, currently within the remit of the Department of Education and Science, to the Irish Youth Justice Service is intended to take place on the 1st of March, 2007. Currently the Irish Prison Service has responsibility for 16 and 17 year old children who have been ordered to be detained by the Courts.   In practice the majority of young offenders being detained are male and are detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, which is the designated detention centre for male offenders aged between 16 and 21 years of age.  In addition, current legislation allows all prisons in the State to accommodate persons aged 17 years and over.  The number and location of offenders, aged 16 and 17 years, in detention on 8 December, 2006, are set out in the following table.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Valuation Act 2001, which came into effect on 2nd May 2002, provides that commercially operated child care facilities such as play schools, preschools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools are liable for rates unless specific criteria for exemption are met. This is a continuation of the pre May 2002 situation. In regard to the Valuation Act, 2001, I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Act, and that I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.</P>
        <P>It was not intended that the Valuation Act 2001 would expand or contract the valuation base. The effect of removing any category of property such as commercially operated childcare centres from the valuation base would be to increase the rates <Col N="922"/>burden on other ratepayers.  At the time of drafting the Valuation Act 2001 it was considered that where Exchequer assistance to certain sectors was desirable it should be direct assistance rather than interfering with local authority funding by way of rates relief. Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 outlines the categories of property and the various uses that are deemed to be non rateable under the Act. Paragraphs 10 (education) and 16 (charitable purposes) are two areas in that schedule which may be relevant to the rateability of preschool facilities.</P>
        <P>In the area of education, paragraph 10 Schedule 4, exemption is limited to educational institutions, not established and not conducted for making profit or funded wholly or mainly from funds provided by the Exchequer and in either case is open to the general public.  Paragraph 16 Schedule 4 provides exemption for charitable organisations that occupies and uses its facility exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for profit.  Therefore cr&egrave;ches/preschool/ playschool facilities established on a non-profit generating basis and/or operated by a charitable organisation for charitable purposes are not liable for rates.</P>
        <P>The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on the net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property.  Any ratepayer dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>
        <P>Rating legislation, as distinct from valuation legislation, and issues arising from it are matters for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children.  Following on from increases in Child Benefit in Budget 2006, this policy has seen a further increase of &euro;10 per month announced in Budget 2007.  This increase will come into effect in April 2007 and will bring the monthly rate of Child Benefit to &euro;160 for the first and second child and &euro;195 for the third and subsequent child.</P>
        <P>Budget 2006 also marked the introduction of a National Childcare Strategy costing a cumulative &euro;2.65bn over five years to address the supply and the cost of childcare.  This strategy included the introduction of the Early Childcare Supplement worth &euro;1,000 annually for each child up to his/her sixth birthday.  A four week extension to both paid and unpaid maternity leave was introduced in 2006 and a further four week increase to both paid and unpaid maternity leave becomes effective in 2007, bringing the duration of paid <Col N="923"/>maternity leave up to 26 weeks at that time and the duration of unpaid leave to 16 weeks.</P>
        <P>A major new multi-annual National Childcare Investment Programme, running from 2006-2010, will support the creation of an extra 50,000 childcare places.  To date, over 900 capital grant applications, amounting to more than &euro;170m, have been received.  To complement the roll-out of these new places, a total of 17,000 childcare workers will be trained over five years.  Under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Programme 2000-2006, more than 32,000 new places have been created and a further 24,500 places have been supported with grant-aid allocations amounting to almost &euro;500m over the last six years.  I would also mention that in December 2005, the Government established the Office of the Minister for Children (OMC) to bring greater coherence to policy making for children.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Childcare Facilities in June 2001.  The Guidelines indicate that planning authorities should ensure that their Development Plans and Local Area Plans should include policies in relation to the provision of childcare facilities. The Guidelines state that planning authorities should require the provision of at least one childcare facility for new housing areas unless there are significant reasons to the contrary, for example, development consisting of single bedroomed apartments or where there are adequate childcare facilities in adjoining developments. For new housing areas, a threshold of one childcare facility for each 75 dwellings is suggested as being appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A scheme of tax relief in the form of capital allowances has been available since 1 July 1999 aimed at encouraging the establishment of park and ride facilities in larger urban areas.  In addition to park and ride facilities, the scheme made provision for allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on certain commercial premises and residential accommodation to be located at park and ride facilities subject to certain limits. Entitlement to relief is dependent on local authority certification that a park and ride development meets detailed requirements set out in Guidelines drawn up by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Capital allowances are available for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of a park and ride facility.  The rate at which the expenditure can be written off depends on whether the person claiming the allowances is operating the park and ride facility or leasing the facility to an operator.  An owner-operator can claim allowances of up to 100% in a single year while a lessor can claim allowances of up to 50% in a single year.  Any remaining expenditure can be written off at the rate of 4% per annum.</P>
        <P>Apart from some restrictions on relief applying to commercial premises and residential accommodation at a park and ride facility, there is no limit on the amount of construction or refurbishment expenditure that can qualify for tax relief. There is no provision for a maximum amount per parking space provided.  However, the guidelines stipulate that a park and ride facility must provide a certain minimum number of parking spaces if it is to be a qualifying park and ride facility for tax relief purposes.</P>
        <P>Although there have been a number of planning approvals granted by local authorities in respect of park and ride facilities, there has been limited take up of this scheme with only two certified projects proceeding since 1999. I have no details available to me about these certified projects.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the tax year 2003 and earlier years claims for the relief mentioned in the question were aggregated in tax returns with other claims and could not be distinguished from the reliefs claimed in respect of different schemes. Accordingly, the specific information on costs for 2003 and earlier years is not available to Revenue. Pro<Col N="927"/>visions were included in the Finance Act 2004 to allow this data to be obtained separately for the tax years 2004 <i>et seq</i>. Based on the information that has been received and collated to date in respect of the tax year 2004, a total of approximately &euro;0.3 million was included in the relevant income tax returns for that year as claims relating to the park and ride scheme. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost for 2004 of some &euro;0.1 million in terms of income tax forgone. These figures are preliminary estimates and may change as further returns are processed.</P>
        <P>Data for the tax years 2005 and 2006 is not yet available as the income tax returns for those years are  due for filing in October 2006 and October 2007 respectively. The income tax returns for 2005 which have been received since October 2006 have yet to be processed.</P>
        <P>Like other property incentive schemes, the park and ride scheme has been extended on a number of occasions but is due to end on 31 July 2008. This extended deadline applies where a valid application for full planning permission was received by the relevant local authority by 31 December 2004 and work to the value of at least 15% of the actual construction or refurbishment costs is carried out by 31 December 2006. Any expenditure incurred up to 31 December 2006 will qualify for full tax relief.  However, any expenditure incurred during 2007 or between 1 January 2008 and 31 July 2008 is restricted to 75% and 50% relief, respectively.	</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The cost benefit analysis in respect of the Tramore Road phase of the proposed flood relief scheme for John&rsquo;s River (Waterford City) follows the same criteria used in relation to the evaluation of the economic benefits of all flood relief schemes.  The benefits are equal to the damages avoided.  The key benefits that are taken into consideration are tangible benefits (direct property damage averted; indirect property, community and business loss avoided; disruption of road traffic avoided) and intangible benefits (avoidance of anxiety, inconvenience and ill health). This is a complex process and requires collation of extensive data on the physical quantification and economic valuation of damages and loss.</P>
        <P>The accepted standard methodology for assessing the costs of flood damage and benefits of flood relief schemes is based on extensive research carried out in the UK by the Flood Hazard Research Centre (FHRC) at Middlesex University leading to standardised unit loss figures for particular types of building or property.  This research has been published in a series of reports known as the Flood Loss Assessment Information Reports (FLAIR).  This flood damage cost data, which has been updated by Middlesex, has been accepted as the basis for damage estimation in Ireland and has also been converted to euro values and updated for inflation.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance discount rate for public investment is 5%.  The life of the works over which the benefits are discounted is taken as 50 years.  For computation purposes, it is assumed that the residual value of the works at the end of this period is nil.  This may be regarded as somewhat conservative since the works should have a design life of 100 years.  However, it is in accordance with standard methodology for economic appraisal of flood alleviation proposals developed in other countries.</P>
        <P>The proposed works in the Tramore Road phase of the scheme involve approximately 3 km <Col N="929"/>of new road construction and associated roadworks and the realignment of several short sections of the John&rsquo;s River.  The benefit area is the section of the Tramore Road where the works would be undertaken.  However, there are no properties in this area and the only benefit accruing would be in relation to avoidance of costs associated with traffic disruption.  The calculated benefit was &euro;0.35 million (economic benefits for 100 year return period flood measured over 50 year discount at 5% per annum discount rate). As the estimated cost of the proposed work is &euro;7 million, this gave a benefit to cost ratio of 0.05 and was therefore not deemed to be economically viable.  The decision was therefore taken to omit the Tramore Road phase from the proposed flood relief scheme as it did not meet the Department of Finance requirement that a flood relief scheme be economically viable.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have answered a Parliamentary Question from him, relating to this person, on 3 October 2006. As I stated then, the person concerned applied for the tax concessions under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme and that the application has been unsuccessful at first instance and on appeal to the Medical Board of Appeal for the Scheme. I have no direct responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the Medical Board of Appeal for the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme. Queries regarding individual cases may be addressed to the Secretary of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, c/o the National Rehabilitation Hospital, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, County Dublin or alternatively by telephone at 01 2355279. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which determines appeals from a refusal of a Primary Medical Certificate under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme, is independent in the execution of its functions.</P>
        <P>In relation to extending the scope of the Scheme, the operation of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme was reviewed by a special Interdepartmental Review Group.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assist<Col N="930"/>ing the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Group&rsquo;s Report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the possible future development of the scheme. The short-term recommendations in respect of the appeals process have been implemented.  The main change arising from these was that an increased number of members could be appointed to the Appeal Board, which facilitated a far greater number of appeal hearings than had been the case prior to the Report&rsquo;s publication.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</P>

	<P>The Commissioners of Public Works carried out a Flood Relief Scheme on the Shinkeen Stream in Hazelhatch in County Kildare which was completed in 2002. In addition, works were funded and carried out by the OPW on behalf of Kildare County Council on the Lyreen and Meadowbrook Rivers in Maynooth together with the Morrell River in the Kill/Johnstown area in 2003. Works were also carried out on the River Slate in 2003 with the OPW acting as agents for Kildare County Council.</P>
        <P>Kildare County Council and OPW agree that the existing information in relation to flooding at Ardclough is insufficient to address the flooding problem.  The existing study indicates that surface water problems are a major factor in the flooding of this area. In relation to flooding at Straffan, this is a surface water problem and therefore a matter for the Local Authority.</P>
        <P>The Commissioners of Public Works met with Kildare County Council in November 2006 and it was agreed that a flood relief scheme could be provided for the Rye River if the County Council has the necessary planning processes complete in early 2007. The proposed works would be funded by the OPW with the Commissioners of Public Works prepared to undertake them as agents for the Local Authority. The flooding at Mill Lane, Leixlip was also discussed and we are continuing to work with the County Council and their Con<Col N="935"/>sulting Engineers to establish a solution to the flooding in this area.</P>

	<P>In 2006, total health funding is &euro;13.147 billion, which represents an underlying increase of 12.04% over 2005. The vast bulk of this funding is provided under the vote of the Health Service Executive (HSE)  which has statutory responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  This continuing high level of investment by the Government provides the Executive with considerable capacity to address the healthcare needs of the population in the most effective manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in response to a question from the Deputy on 28 November last, the decision to transfer St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin was taken by the Government as part of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  The decision was taken in the best interests of cancer patients and is based on expert medical, scientific and management advice.  It is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is available on site with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  It is in line with best international practice.  This is the model that exists at Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital Galway and which is being developed at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, Dublin.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred from a stand alone facility to Belfast City Hospital, which is a major academic teaching hospital.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the HSE and the National Development Finance Agency to progress the delivery of the Plan.  The Agency has  assembled a team to progress the financial and procurement aspects of the Plan, to be provided mostly by PPP.  The HSE has appointed a Project Manager and support team.  The Clinical Output Specifications are being finalised and technical advisors will be appointed shortly to advise on the construction and other technical aspects of the project.  Pending the full roll-out of the Plan, six new linear accelerators will be provided by traditional procurement in the Eastern Region.  I am pleased to say that two of these will be provided at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin in late 2007.  In addition two each will be provided in St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont Hospitals by early 2009.</P>
        <P>The Government and I are anxious to build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  It is held in great affection by the Irish people.  Many thousands of Irish patients and their families from every part of the country have experienced high quality cancer care at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision. <Col N="940"/> In preparation for the transfer of services to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, discussions have commenced between the Boards of both Hospitals, with the twin goals of ensuring continuity of expertise and ethos in the care of cancer patients and the effective integration of multi-disciplinary patient care at the one site.   I am confident the transition will be managed with great sensitivity and skill by the two hospital Boards to achieve those objectives.</P>
        <P>No decision has yet been taken on the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  However my objective is to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interests of the health services.  I will discuss this issue in due course with the Health Service Executive and the Hospital Board.</P>

Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.

My  Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Sheltered housing can play a significant role in allowing older people to remain in their own community. There is potential to expand sheltered housing provision in Ireland, and it is one of the issues to be explored arising from the work of the Long Term Care Group.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 to 253, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Expert Panel on Testing of Blood for Transfusion, which reported in September 2002, made 11 recommendations and each of them either has been or is in the course of being implemented by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) or other relevant body, as appropriate.  I am aware of the inadequacies of the existing Transfusion Centre at St Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital and accept the need for it to be replaced. Pending its replacement, the IBTS has invested over &euro;3 million in its refurbishment to ensure compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. I am also aware of the fact that 30% of donations come from the Munster area.</P>
        <P>In relation to the review mentioned by the Deputy, I take it that this is a reference to a Cost Benefit Analysis of the proposed new Transfusion Centre for the Munster area. This is required to be carried out by the IBTS under the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector because the estimated cost of the new Centre is in the region of &euro;30 million. I have recently received from the IBTS a copy of a report from consultants who were commissioned to undertake this analysis. I will meet the Chairperson and members of the Board shortly to discuss the report.</P>
        <P>One of the issues dealt with in the report is that of back-up arrangements between the centres in Cork and Dublin in the event of emergency shutdown of either centre.  I might add that arrange<Col N="943"/>ments are in place with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service to carry out Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) on all blood samples. The Scottish Service provided NAT testing on Irish blood until this test was introduced in Dublin in July 2004.</P>

        <P LI="1">Wexford General Hospital &mdash; 19 in-patient beds</P>
        <P LI="1">St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Elm Park &mdash; 12 day treatment places and 4 intensive care beds</P>
        <P LI="1">Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin &mdash; 7 oncology day treatment places</P>
        <P LI="1">University College Hospital Galway &mdash; 3 in-patient beds in the new burns unit.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, the HSE is fast-tracking the provision of admission units to alleviate pressures in a number of A &amp; E departments.  Admission lounges have been developed at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital (15 beds), Connolly Memorial Hospital (8 beds), St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital (20 beds), Tallaght Hospital (40 beds), Cork University Hospital (10 beds) and the Mercy Hospital in Cork (4 beds).  These admissions lounges enable patients awaiting admission to an acute hospital bed to be managed safely while preserving their right to dignity and privacy.  Further admission lounges are scheduled to come on-stream in 2007.</P>
        <P>The HSE has introduced a broad-based Winter Initiative. Its purpose is to ensure that the services required to address the particular demands of the winter season are in place and operating optimally. It encompasses not just hospital services but also primary and community care services. The actions and initiatives being taken by the HSE are designed to deliver the sustained improvement in hospital services that patients and their families deserve.</P>
        <P>A Steering Group under the chairmanship of the National Director of the National Hospitals Office is reviewing our acute hospital bed requirements up to the year 2020.   The Group includes representatives of the Health Service Executive, my Department, the Department of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>

Under this Scheme, grant-in-aid is made available on an annual basis to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to a combination of factors e.g. social isolation, substance misuse and inadequate take-up of ordinary educational opportunities. It would be open to the organisation in question to submit an application for funding under this Scheme in the 2007 round of grants and in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also wish to note that the promotion of positive recreational opportunities is being actively pursued by my Office in the context of the development of a national recreation policy for young people aged 12 to 18. Key issues on the measures necessary to facilitate improved access to recreation, including specific actions to develop and expand recreational opportunities for young people, are being considered by my Office in the context of the finalisation of the policy which I expect to publish in the near future.</P>

	<P>My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) to progress the National Radiation Oncology Plan announced by Government in July 2005.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. </P>
        <P>The NDFA has assembled a team to progress the financial and procurement aspects and the HSE has appointed a Project Manager and support team.  A Clinical Output Specification Group is well advanced in specifying the clinical aspects of the development.  Technical advisors will be appointed shortly to advise on the construction and other technical aspects of the project.  I have also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group to advise me on progress on the implementation of the plan.</P>
        <P>I have approved the provision of two additional linear accelerators at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the national plan.  I expect these services to commence late next year.  I recently also announced the approval of two radiation oncology facilities at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, comprising of two linear accelerators and associated treatment planning at each site, to be delivered in early 2009.  These are key elements of the delivery of the National Plan.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised my Department that its planning and procurement processes, which have been developed in conjunction with the NDFA, are designed to ensure the earliest possible delivery of radiotherapy nationally, including at Waterford Regional Hospital.  Potential providers will be asked to specify detailed delivery timescales for all sites as part of the competitive bidding process.  While the HSE has developed indicative timelines for planning purposes, it considers, for commercial reasons, that this information should not be made public at this stage in the process.</P>

	<P>My Department, in partnership with the National Disability Authority (NDA), has developed draft National Standards for Disability Services (NSDS) in consultation with people with disabilities, their families, carers, service providers, health services providers and other stakeholders.  These standards are designed to ensure that services are provided to an agreed level of quality and that the level of quality is consistent on a national basis. It is proposed that the standards will apply to a range of services for people with disabilities as funded by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The draft NSDS are being considered within the framework of the Health Services Reform Programme. A critical element in this process is the establishment of the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA).  The new Health Bill which will be  published in the current Dail session will include provision for the establishment of HIQA on a statutory basis.  The establishment of HIQA as a key part of the architec<Col N="954"/>ture of planning and developing health and personal social services in Ireland will promote a continuous quality improvement ethos in the health system.  The development and implementation of the NSDS is a central element of the process.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, the draft NSDS have been forwarded to the interim HIQA for its consideration.  The implementation process for the NSDS will necessarily involve an incremental process of planning, training and implementation over the coming years.</P>

	<P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 came into effect on 30 June 2006.  The repayment scheme was launched publicly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald on 14 August 2006.  A national advertising campaign and a helpline also commenced on this date.</P>
        <P>Under the scheme all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons,  who were wrongly charged  for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.</P>
        <P>The Scheme Administrator has commenced scanning the records of long stay facilities around the country and to date more than 50 locations have been visited for this purpose.  These records will form the basis for the calculation of the majority of the repayments.</P>
        <P>In relation to dates of repayments to applicants, the HSE has informed the Department that over 21,000 forms have been submitted to the scheme administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present. The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by the estate of a deceased person. Living people who were wrongly charged will be the first to receive payments under the scheme. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 15,000 people within this category.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that offers of repayment have commenced and that the first payments have issued with further payments continuing in subsequent weeks. It is expected that the bulk of <Col N="956"/>payments to estates will commence in the Spring of 2007.</P>
        <P>Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008.</P>

	<P>In making arrangements for the provision of publicly funded GP services, under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, an agreement was negotiated between the Department of Health and Children and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO). The provisions of this agreement took the form of the current GMS GP Capitation Contract. This contract is a treatment based contract and gives effect to the statutory requirement to provide free GP medical and surgical services to eligible people which includes people aged 70 and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card. The contract stipulates that the fees paid to GMS GPs are not made in respect of certain certificates which may be required for example &ldquo;under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences&rdquo;. As these non-treatment type services are outside of the GMS GP contract it is a matter between the GP and the person seeking the particular services to agree a fee.</P>
        <P>While certificates for driving licence applications are provided by medical practitioners they are not a medical treatment service and are not considered a core aspect of public health service provision. Requiring such services to be provided with the terms of the GMS GP contract would more than likely lead to costly counterclaim by GPs which if allowed would not represent appropriate or best use of resources in terms of current health policy.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 289 to 293, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that when private ambulance services are contracted to deliver services on its behalf, they must comply with the requirements as laid down by the National Ambulance Office. Private ambulance services carrying out emergency transport duties on the Executive&rsquo;s behalf are required to have two crew members who are Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) registered with the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  The Council is responsible for the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services and for the accreditation of institutions providing training for ambulance personnel.</P>
        <P>In relation to non-emergency hospital transfers, the minimum requirement is that a registered EMT, a registered nurse or a clinician (where required), travel with the patient.</P>
        <P>My Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE and the Director of <Col N="961"/>the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council to arrange to have the other issues raised by the Deputy investigated and to have a reply issued to her directly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.

        <P>When the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and thereby continuing the screening of women in the programme who have reached 65 years of age.

	<P>The charging for long stay care under the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005 is being implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005. These Regulations were signed on 14 June 2005 and reinstated charges for in-patient services and provided for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of in-patient services. The Regulations were prepared following extensive consultation with the HSE and others.</P>
        <P>Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005 provides, inter alia, for the levying of a charge where in-patient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months.</P>
        <P>The Regulations, in keeping with Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.</P>
        <P>Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35 or 80% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the least.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Office of Tobacco Control (OTC) monitors cigarette smoking prevalence and behaviour on a monthly basis to give a detailed picture of smoking patterns in Ireland and to identify trends. Information regarding smoking prevalence can be found at the OTC website  www.otc.ie.  The overall prevalence of cigarette smoking in Ireland is approximately 24% at June 2006, with an almost even split among male/female smokers: 18% of 15-18 year olds report as being smokers.</P>
        <P>Three recent developments are relevant in the context of addressing the problem of smoking among young people.</P>
        <P>Firstly, last week, I announced that from 31 May 2007, it will no longer be legal to sell cigarettes in packs of less than 20.</P>
        <P>Secondly, the Minister for Finance decided to increase the tax on a packet of twenty cigarettes by fifty cent in the context of Budget 2007:  this increase was coupled with a decision to plan for further increases in tobacco excises for a period ahead, so as to keep the level of tax increasing in real terms and with a call on the Social Partners to discount some or all of the effect of such price increases in fixing on the relevant inflation benchmark.</P>
        <P>Finally, the HSE has announced that they are to step up enforcement activity on sales to minors.</P>
        <P>This package of measure should ensure a reduction in smoking prevalence among young people in particular but also among the general population.  I welcome these developments.</P>

	<P>The Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme (PCIP) provides immunisation for all children against BCG, Diphtheria/Polio/Pertussis/ Tetanus/Haemophilus influenza (Hib), Meningococcal C, Measles, Mumps and Rubella.</P>
        <P>Vaccine uptake statistics are collated on a quarterly basis by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The most recent report published in November 2006 for the second quarter 2006 reported the following vaccine uptake rates: BCG at 12 months 92%; Diphtheria/Polio/ Pertussis/Tetanus/Haemophilus influenza (Hib) children at 12 months 86%, children at 24 months 91%; Meningococcal C &mdash; children at 12 months <Col N="969"/>86%, children at 24 months 90%; Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) &mdash; children at 24 months 86%.</P>
        <P>Vaccine uptake figures have shown a steady increase since 2001.  I am concerned about the immunisation uptake rates because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned.  However, I am encouraged by the fact that the immunisation uptake rates are improving.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) is now targeting areas of low vaccine uptake with specific strategies to increase the national figures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>International best practice for the management of North Atlantic Salmon requires the adoption of the precautionary approach and the cessation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries. These are the recommendations of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation and the International Council for the Exploitation of the Sea. Moreover, if we do not end mixed stock fishing in 2007, the EU Commission will unquestionably proceed in their action against Ireland under the Habitats Directive. </P>
        <P>In future the harvest of salmon, by any means, will be restricted to those stocks of rivers that are meeting their conservation limits. This means there will be no indiscriminate capture of fish. Commercial fishing and recreational angling can continue only on the scientifically identified exploitable surplus.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s primary motivation is the conservation of the wild salmon species. It is vital to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch.</P>
        <P>The current imperative must be to maintain stocks above conservation limits or at the very least halt the observed decline. If we do not take action now the relentless decline in stocks will continue, leading to the inevitable demise of wild <Col N="972"/>salmon, valued as a cultural, recreational and economic resource.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the concerns of Donegal County Council Islands Committee and recognising the implications of alignment with the scientific advice for the commercial salmon fishing sector in 2007 and beyond, the Government will put in place a fund to address any financial hardship that may be experienced by the sector. It is proposed to provide a measure of relief to each individual in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced based on the recent catch history of the individual licence holder.</P>
        <P>An additional fund will be available for a community support scheme. The focus of this measure should primarily be those communities where drift-net fishing has been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on their economic and social fabric, e.g. Gaeltacht areas and island communities formerly involved in the drift-netting sector.</P>

	<P>The scheme recommended by the Independent Group in their report is aimed at alleviating hardship which is related to loss of income derived from salmon harvesting in recent years caused, in turn, by the cessation of mixed stock fishing in the interest of conservation. It is not a compensation scheme. The cessation of mixed stock fishing for wild salmon could not be said to cause hardship to people who ceased such fishing many years ago. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 337 together.</P>
        <P>I am guided in these matters by the advice from international expert bodies, such as the World Health Organisation and the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. These bodies continually examine the totality of <Col N="975"/>the scientific and medical evidence available to provide the most up to date and accurate information in regard to the potential health effects, if any, of electromagnetic fields. The advice to date is that there is no causal connection with any health effects.</P>
        <P>The Government approved the establishment of an inter-Departmental committee on the health effects of electromagnetic fields in September 2005. The committee is chaired by my Department and will provide advice to the Government on the appropriate action to be taken on foot of recommendations contained in the report &ldquo;Non-Ionising Radiation from mobile phones handsets and masts&rdquo;, published in June 2005 by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>This committee has overseen the establishment of an expert group on the health effects of electromagnetic fields, which has undertaken a thorough review of the latest scientific reports and will report to the inter-departmental committee on the current scientific consensus and science-based policy. The inter-Departmental committee expects to report to Government in the near future.</P>

	<P>The proposed Total Allowable Catches (TACS) and Quotas regulation was published by the EU Commission on the 5th of December, 2006. The scientific advice for the stocks covered by this regulation was made available by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) on the 20th October, 2006. The Commission&rsquo;s Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) then met from the 6th-10th November, 2006 to examine and consider this advice. The Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) have also examined the reports from the stakeholders perspective and have advised the Commission on the outcome of their deliberations. The EU Commission have brought forward proposals taking account of these advices. </P>
        <P>The advice from ICES on both hake and monkfish was positive and the EU Commission proposal has recommended increases of 15% in the TAC for hake and 6% for monkfish. The proposed regulation will be further considered at the December Fisheries Council which commences on the 19th December, 2006 and will adopt TACs and quotas for 2007.</P>

	<P>The welfare of the undocumented Irish in the United States is an issue of the highest priority for the Government. In all of my dealings with key figures in the US Congress and Administration, I emphasise our strong support for <Col N="982"/>measures that would enable the undocumented to regularise their status and have open to them a path to permanent residency. </P>
        <P>Following the recent mid-term Congressional elections, I wrote to a number of senior US legislators, including Senator Charles Schumer. In writing to the Senator, I took the opportunity to reiterate to him the Government&rsquo;s concerns about the situation of the undocumented Irish and our deep appreciation of his keen interest in this issue. Our Ambassador in Washington is in regular contact with Senator Schumer on this issue, and the Embassy keeps in close contact with his office in Washington, as the Consulate General does also with his office in New York.</P>
        <P>I maintain very close contact with our community in the United States. I had another meeting in New York on 10 November with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR), an organisation that is proving highly effective in communicating the Irish dimension to this issue on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, and which the Government is happy to support financially.</P>
        <P>Bruce Morrison, who is based in Washington, is also a very well established and regular contact of the Embassy, and a close adviser to the ILIR.</P>
        <P>Both Senator Schumer and Bruce Morrison addressed ILIR&rsquo;s well supported rally in New York on 1 December. I very much welcome their strong engagement on this issue and will continue to maintain close contact with them in the critical period ahead.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a further intensification of the Government&rsquo;s efforts on behalf of the undocumented, in particular when the incoming Congress is convened in the New Year.</P>

	<P>The National Library of Ireland became an autonomous statutory body under the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997 on 3rd <Col N="987"/>May 2005. The Board of the National Library is statutorily responsible for the acquisition of material to enlarge its collection.  </P>
        <P>The purchase in question occurred subsequent to that date.  Accordingly, I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
        <P>I understand from the National Library that the material was formally offered to the National Library through Sotheby&rsquo;s in late 2004. The NLI reached agreement on a price with Sotheby&rsquo;s in March 2005 and a contract for sale was signed in June 2005. At the Library&rsquo;s request, the AIB Group facilitated the purchase of the manuscripts by the Library, as it had done with the purchase of the Leon Collection in 2003 and 2004.</P>
        <P>The manuscript material in question was donated to the National Library under the provisions of section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (the &ldquo;tax credit scheme&rdquo;). The manuscript was acquired by AIB Group from the vendor and subsequently donated to the Library. All of the relevant procedures were followed in relation to the donation. AIB Group applied for and received a tax credit equivalent to the purchase price under the tax credit scheme.</P>
        <P>Independent assessments and valuations were obtained by the National Library and the agreed value of the donation was settled based on those valuations. The donation was also assessed by the Selection Committee that examines proposed donations under the Tax Credit Scheme. The Committee made a favourable determination in relation to the donation and it is understood that the Revenue Commissioners also commissioned an independent valuation of the material.</P>
        <P>At no stage was the material on offer to the National Library at a lower price than was subsequently agreed.</P>
        <P>The National Library has no knowledge as to what price the vendor paid for the material.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 361 and 360 together.</P>
        <P>The ADR is an international agreement drawn up by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.  Its main purpose is to secure the safety of international transport of dangerous goods by road.  Ireland&rsquo;s formal accession to the ADR took effect from 12 November 2006.</P>
        <P>The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 405 of 2006) came into operation on 31 July 2006. The Regulations apply to the carriage, in tanks, in bulk and in packages, of dangerous goods by road, including the packing, loading, filling and unloading of the dangerous goods in relation to their carriage. They apply the provisions of the Annexes A and B to the &ldquo;European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road&rdquo; (ADR) 2005.</P>
        <P>The Regulations also place duties on the various participants associated with the carriage of the dangerous goods. They contain requirements for the vehicles, tanks, tank containers, receptacles and packages containing the dangerous goods during their carriage. They require that the drivers, and others involved in the carriage of the dangerous goods by road, be adequately trained and, in the case of drivers, hold certificates of such training. They also contain provisions on an EC harmonised approach to the road checks aspect of their enforcement.</P>
        <P>EU Directive 94/55/EC as amended and adapted to technical progress, requires national legislation to be in line with the Annexes to ADR, which are updated and replaced every 2 years.  S.I. 405 of 2006 reflects the 2005 update.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s attention has been drawn to a number of errors in S.I. No. 405 of 2006, relating inter alia, to certain provisions of the Regulations concerning the application of some payment in lieu of prosecution provisions relating to some minor offences. I am informed, however, that these do not affect the overall initiation of any necessary prosecution proceedings under the Regulations by the Health and Safety Authority, which is responsible for the monitoring and enforcement of standards under the Statutory Instrument.</P>
        <P>The latest adaptation to technical progress of Directive 94/55/EC, which reflects the 2007 update of the ADR, is through Commission Directive 2006/89/EC of 3 November 2006, which is due to be transposed into national legislation by 1 July 2007.  Work has already commenced by the Health and Safety Authority on the development of proposals for new Regulations to implement the 2007 version of the ADR to ensure that it is transposed by the due date.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> the number of inspections that have taken place in the retail sector to ensure that established pay rates are not being undermined by employers recruiting foreign staff to work at below the agreed rates; the number of cases where evidence was found that workers were not receiving their full entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Inspectorate of the Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including migrant workers. The Inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to migrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the Inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P>In many instances the wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the retail sector are governed by Employment Regulation Orders or Registered Employment Agreements, which are enforced by the Labour Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The Retail Grocery and Allied Trades Joint Labour Committee sets down the rates of remuneration and conditions of employment by way of Employment Regulation Orders. Persons whose employment is covered by these Employment Regulation Orders are entitled to the terms and conditions therein. The number of inspections undertaken by the Labour Inspectorate under the Order in 2006 was 44. Breaches were detected in the case of 20 inspections. Inspections undertaken under the Order in 2005 amounted to 84 and breaches were detected in 37 instances.</P>
        <P>The Registered Employment Agreement (Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire) Drapery, Footwear and Allied Trades sets down the rates of remuneration and conditions of employment of workers covered by the Agreement. The Labour Inspectorate undertook five inspections under the Registered Employment Agreement in 2006 and breaches were detected in the case of 4 inspections. Inspections undertaken under the Registered Employment Agreement in 2005 amounted to 9 and breaches were detected in 2 instances.</P>
        <P>In addition to the inspections undertaken under the Retail Grocery and Allied Trades Employment Regulation Order and the Registered Employment Agreement (Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire) Drapery, Footwear and Allied Trades, a substantial number of inspections were undertaken in retail outlets whose employees are <Col N="994"/>covered by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. In 2006 the Labour Inspectorate undertook 1,015 inspections under the Act. Breaches were detected in the case of 45 inspections. Inspections undertaken under the Act in 2005 amounted to 481 and breaches were detected in 92 instances.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Social Partnership Agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; provides for the establishment of an Office of the Director for Employment Rights Compliance (ODERC) which, in addition to the provision of employment rights information and the prosecution of offences, will also have responsibility for the Labour Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The number of Labour Inspectors under this Office will be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by end-2007 while existing arrangements in relation to the investigation of particular employments in relation to employment rights and compliance will be strengthened. The revised arrangements will also provide that, in certain cases, the ODERC may take cases to the Courts with a view to securing convictions by way of prosecutions for summary or indictable offences, notwithstanding any redress actions that may be taken.  Where the employer fails to make good the amounts of money which are owed to the employee under employment rights legislation redress will be obtained via the Rights Commissioner Service.</P>
        <P>Provision will also be made for improved record keeping in order to protect workers&rsquo; employment rights and to ensure consistency between statutory employment records and record keeping requirements for employers in relation to, for example, taxation and social welfare. Employers will have clear responsibilities in relation to the maintenance and production of up-to-date statutory records.</P>
        <P>In addition, the ODERC will be empowered to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in the Joint Investigation Units.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; also provides for the deployment of the Labour Inspectorate on a regionalised basis. Proposals in this regard are being prepared at present and will be finalised following the appointment of the Director of the Office for Employment Rights Compliance.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions. While I may give general policy directives to the Agency under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>For an area to successfully compete with other locations, nationally and internationally, in attracting sustainable foreign investment it is vital that the requirements of potential investors are met. It is the investor who ultimately decides where to locate. What they are indicating to IDA is that they are seeking an urban base close to third level educational facilities that provides infrastructure and services that are international in focus. The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) provides a framework for meeting these requirements through the prioritisation of investment in the Gateway and Hub locations. A key task for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development in tandem with the NSS.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for Tipperary is to primarily concentrate future economic development in Clonmel and to develop the town as a first-class location for overseas investment. This strategy has been agreed with the South Tipperary County Development Board and is already achieving results. Last September, I was pleased to officially open a &euro;90 million high-value drug-eluting stent manufacturing operation for Abbott Vascular, one of the world&rsquo;s leading healthcare companies.  The expansion involves 500 new jobs.</P>
        <P>Following discussions with South Tipperary Co. Council, IDA Ireland purchased circa 50 acres of land in the Council owned Ballingarrane Estate in Clonmel to develop a Business and Technology Park. The future development of the Ballingarrane Estate in Clonmel, incorporating <Col N="996"/>the IDA Business Park and Tipperary Institute of Technology, will be a key asset in attracting further overseas investment into the County.</P>
        <P>While the primary focus of IDA activities is on promoting and marketing Clonmel, the Agency continues to promote all available facilities in the County, including its 10 acre serviced site at Knockenrawley in Tipperary Town, which has been upgraded to a Business Park.  A 16,000 sq ft advance factory (BES funded) has been constructed on the park and IDA continues to actively promote this advance manufacturing facility through their network of overseas offices. In marketing Tipperary for new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland is focused on attracting overseas companies in the services and knowledge based industries (including advanced manufacturing). Key sectors of focus for IDA in Tipperary are international services, healthcare and pharmaceuticals.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the policies and strategies being pursued by IDA Ireland are the most appropriate ones to attract and grow foreign direct investment in the County and that these will, in turn, contribute to balanced regional development and the growth of sustainable, quality employment into the future.</P>

        <P>All funding provided by Enterprise Ireland is subject to a legal grant agreement between the company and Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland grant aided companies must meet the obligations to creditors and employees in the event of closure or liquidation.</P>
        <P>Clubman Omega Limited ceased manufacturing in December 2005, following which, in line with its normal policy, Enterprise Ireland revoked and sought repayment of certain Employment Grants and of the Preference Shares that Enterprise Ireland had invested in the development of the company.</P>
        <P>An offer of repayment of the preference shares was made by the company to Enterprise Ireland but, this offer cannot be properly considered by Enterprise Ireland until the agency has actually <Col N="997"/>received up-to-date accounts from the company.  The latter have been repeatedly sought by Enterprise Ireland but have not yet been furnished by the company.</P>
        <P>The situation regarding grant liabilities is disputed by the company.  Enterprise Ireland is considering its response, including possible legal action to recover those liabilities, but in order to duly consider the matter, the agency will need to have sight of the company&rsquo;s accounts.</P>
        <P>As regards the factory premises, Enterprise Ireland has no charge over the building and the agency&rsquo;s consent is not required for the sale of the building by the company.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to pursue the company to provide it with up-to-date accounts to enable the situation regarding the repayment of preference shares and outstanding grant liabilities to be resolved.</P>

	<P>The company referred to went into liquidation in October 2006 and in accordance with the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003, lump sum payments were paid directly to 45 employees of the company concerned, in November this year out of the Social Insurance Fund.  This Department is not in a position to say what assets the company has other than the plant.  There are no legislative provisions in operation for this Department to compel the company to pay amounts over and above the statutory redundancy lump sums to redundant workers.</P>
        <P>In a collective redundancy situation employers are required to notify the Minister at least 30 days before the redundancies commence. In this instance, as the company went into liquidation, no notification was received by the Department. In liquidation situations the person responsible for the affairs of the business need notify the Minister only where the Minister so requests.  However, the local F&Aacute;S Office has been informed of the redundancies, as is the normal practice in collective redundancy cases.  The resources of F&Aacute;S are available to all redundant workers.  F&Aacute;S provides workers with information and advice and places workers on training programmes, which generally lead to further employment.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a comprehensive system of regulation in place through the Financial Regulator, The Pensions Board and the Pensions Ombudsman to deal with the various types of pension arrangements which are available and the different aspects of these products.</P>
        <P>The Pensions Board itself is at present carrying out a review of its operations to see how it might perform its role more effectively in the current pensions environment. Broadly, I understand that the Board plans to take a more pro-active approach to the supervision of schemes and PRSAs, in line with international best practice and EU requirements and the Department would support such an approach. The Board will shortly present its proposals in this regard and the associated requirement for additional resources to the Department and these will then be considered in detail in conjunction with the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>The trustees of a pension scheme have a duty under the Pensions Act to manage the scheme in <Col N="1003"/>line with the prudent person principle which takes account of the particular nature of the scheme. The funding standard under the Act, sets out the requirements regarding assets and liabilities in a wind-up situation so as to ensure that the fund can meet its liabilities in such a situation.  With regard to the issues raised in relation to conflicts of interest, trustees of schemes are required to at all times act in the best interests of scheme members. The Pensions Board is not aware of any situation involving employers or trustees where conflicts of interest have arisen in relation to the administration of schemes.</P>
        <P>There is little information on general wealth in the country and the alternative ways in which people intend to provide for their retirement, including investing in property. However, in so far as is possible, it is hoped to address this information deficit in research to be undertaken in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions which it is expected will be published by the end of March next year. The Green Paper will also deal with issues in relation to the various tax incentives that are available to support and encourage private and occupational pension provision and the future costs and financing.</P>

	<P>My Department has no role in relation to specifying the duties appropriate to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and it would not be appropriate for me to initiate legislation as suggested.  Tax foregone through reliefs provided for pension contributions and investment gains is a very significant investment by the State in the voluntary supplementary pensions system. It is important that the State receives value for money for this investment and that the reliefs provided are effective in encouraging and maintaining supplementary pension provision.  As the House is aware, the Government will, under the terms of Towards 2016, produce a Green Paper on pensions and this will include an exam<Col N="1004"/>ination of all relevant aspects of the system of tax reliefs which are in place to support private pension provision as well as an assessment of future pension costs and how they can be met. The Green Paper is due to be published by the end of March 2007. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 375 and 376 together.</P>
        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is and has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer&rsquo;s allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. This means test has been eased significantly over the years.</P>
        <P>Following Budget 2006, the earnings disregard for a couple has been set at &euro;580 per week which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings. As a result of further improvements which I announced in the Budget 2007 this disregard will increase to &euro;640 per week for a couple from April 2007. When this increase is in place a couple with two children will be able to earn up to &euro;36,240 and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits. This measure surpasses the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure that those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>I understand that eligibility for the Rural Social Scheme which is administered by Pobal is generally linked to eligibility for a social welfare payment. As a general rule only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, however, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are pro<Col N="1005"/>viding full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition.</P>
        <P>In the recent Budget I provided for a very significant reform which will enable people in receipt of a social welfare payment other than carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit who are providing full time care and attention to retain their main payment and receive another payment up to a maximum of a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The improvements for carers which I announced in Budget 2007 are further evidence of the Governments commitment to improving the position of family carers and those they care for.</P>

	<P>The person concerned was refused the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance on the grounds that full time care and attention as prescribed in regulations is not required in this case.  On 27 November 2006 he was notified of the decision, the reason for it and of his right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The arrangements for an appeal are now being made.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the reason persons in receipt of disability benefit payments from his Department are not entitled to the Christmas bonus payment from his Department, as is the case for other social welfare recipients; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>A special Christmas Bonus payment was first introduced in December, 1980, for social welfare pensioners and people who depend solely on their social welfare payments for income support. There have been a number of developments in this scheme since its inception, including changes in the level of the bonus payment, the introduction of a minimum payment and the extension of the categories of eligible claimants. </P>
        <P>The Christmas Bonus has again been paid this year to all recipients of long-term social welfare payments, at a rate equivalent to 100% of the person&rsquo;s normal weekly payment, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;30. The cost of this measure is an estimated &euro;157 million this year, <Col N="1006"/>and it benefited some 1.25 million persons comprising 855,000 recipients and 394,000 dependants.  The focus of the bonus has always been on persons who rely on the social welfare system for financial support over the long term. These include recipients of State pension (transition), State pension (contributory and non-contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s and invalidity pensions, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, farm assist and people in receipt of employment support payments.</P>
        <P>As carer&rsquo;s benefit is now payable for up to 2 years, the bonus was, for the first time this year, paid to recipients of this benefit. The bonus is also payable to participants in the rural social scheme, which was introduced in 2004, and operates under the aegis of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  There are no plans at present to amend or extend entitlement to the bonus payment to short-term schemes, and any such extension could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to the resources available and the significant cost which would be involved. In relation to illness benefit, it is open to persons who have been in receipt of illness benefit for at least a year to apply for invalidity pension, and, if they qualify for the pension they would also qualify for the Christmas Bonus payment.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 19 September 2006. Qualification for disability allowance depends on an applicant passing a means test and fulfilling certain medical conditions.  An applicant must be substantially restricted by reason of a specified injury, be suffering from an injury, disease, illness or physical or mental disability that has continued or may be expected to continue for at least one year and, as a result, substantially restricted in undertaking suitable work. </P>
        <P>The applicant concerned was examined by a Medical Assessor of my Department and the file was referred to a Social Welfare Investigator for determination of his means.

	<P>The Pensions Board is a representative Body, comprising a chairperson and sixteen ordinary members which is appointed by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, under the provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990.  It is important that the Pensions Board membership should comprise a diverse range of skills dealing with the different aspects of pensions schemes, while at the same time ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders in this area are represented.  The Pensions Act requires that the ordinary members of the Board consist of 1 representative of each of the actuarial, accounting and legal professions with other interested groups represented by  2 union representatives (including 1 scheme trustee), 2 employer representatives (including 1 scheme trustee), 2 representatives of occupational pension schemes, 1 representative of  pensioners, 1 representative of consumer interests, 1 representative of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and 1 representative of the Department of Finance. In addition, there are 3 direct nominees of the Minister.  Overall, I am satisfied that the current representation of the Board and the manner of its appointment is comprehensive and balanced and ensures that the views of all interests are well represented in the regulatory and policy advice work of the Board. I will, however, keep the matter under review.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory) a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record.   Reduced pensions are paid to those  with yearly averages as low as 10 contributions and arrangements are also in place for  the payment of pro-rata pensions to those with mixed rate insurance records or contributions from different countries.  </P>
        <P>Reduced rate or<i> pro rata</i> pensions are paid at a fixed percentage of the full rate payment in order to reflect the level of contribution which individuals make and this principle also applies to the increase for qualified adults.  However, in the case of some reduced rate contributory pensions the qualified adult increase was being paid at a higher rate than that being paid in respect of the pensioner.  In these reduced rate cases the personal rate is reduced to reflect the average level of contributions paid but in some cases the maximum increase for qualified adults was being paid.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2001 the Government began a process the object of which is to increase the payment for qualified adults (age 66 or over) to the same level as the personal rate of the state pension (non-contributory).  Accordingly, it was decided to standardise increases for qualified adults by ensuring that they reflect the level at which the personal rate is paid as was already the case with most reduced rate contributory pensions being paid. The new arrangements applied to claims made after April 2001.  Special arrangements were, however, introduced for reduced rate cases where the full qualified adult increase was already being paid.  No reduction in payment was made in 2001 and a Budget increase has been applied to this group each year since then.</P>

The other 2 Clerical Officers are on a payscale of &euro;22,102 to &euro;35,838 (Class A rate of PRSI contribution applies as they commenced employment after 6 April 1995).  The total overtime costs and expenses incurred to date in 2006 for the administrative staff in this office are &euro;16,165 and &euro;6,862 respectively.</P>
        <P>The Press Adviser and Special Adviser were appointed by me on a contract basis for my term of office. The Press Adviser is on a personal salary of &euro;103,563 together with a private pension contribution of 11% of salary. The Special Adviser is on a Principal Officer payscale of up to &euro;90,770.

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were being imposed at that time by many of the other Member States. </P>
        <P>The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.  EU Regulations provide that migrant workers who are EEA nationals, i.e. EEA nationals who have been employed since coming to this country, are entitled to payment of family benefits under the same conditions as Irish nationals and the habitual residence condition does not apply in their case.  The effect of the condition in relation to child benefit, therefore, is principally in relation to claims by non-EEA nationals.  Approximately 15% of such claims, received since the introduction of the condition, were refused on the grounds that the habitual residence condition was not satisfied.  Those who are refused are mainly persons whose claim to asylum has not yet been decided, who do not have a work permit or who have a minimal attachment to the workforce in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The reason for the introduction of the habitual residence condition in May 2004 &mdash; to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established their habitual residence in Ireland should not avail of assistance schemes or child benefit &mdash; continues to be relevant.</P>

	<P>The earnings limits for deserted wives benefit were set in 1992.  From 1992 entitlement to benefit at full rate was subject to an earnings limit of &pound;10,000 (approx &euro;12,000) and reduced rates were payable up to an earnings limit &pound;14,000 (approx &euro;17,800) after which there was no entitlement.  When the one parent family payment was <Col N="1013"/>introduced in 1997, the deserted wives benefit scheme was discontinued for new claims from January that year.  Existing recipients could, however, retain their payment subject to continuing to fulfil the qualifying conditions.</P>
        <P>From May 2007, under provisions made in the Budget, a new single earnings limit of &euro;20,000 gross earnings will be introduced for recipients of deserted wives benefit.  Once claimants&rsquo; earnings go over this limit, they will be entitled to a new half-rate, transitional payment for 6 months to ease the impact of losing entitlement to the payment.  This revised upper limit and new transitional payment bring the payment more into line with the one parent family payment. Over 2,300 deserted wives benefit claimants will benefit from these revisions to the scheme.  The estimated cost of this increase in the earnings limit is &euro;0.87million in 2007 and &euro;1.3million for a full year.  To remove the earnings limit would cost in the region of &euro;3m to &euro;6m per annum depending on assumptions.</P>

        <AskConj><b> </b>asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the number of children estimated to be living in poverty; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[42934/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The results of the 2005 EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), which were recently published by the CSO, indicate that about 10% of children under 14 years of age experience consistent poverty.  This figure has to be seen against the backdrop of the substantial progress on remaining child poverty delivered by a range of measures across a number of Departments and agencies over recent years which has resulted in more than 250,000 people being lifted out of consistent poverty, including an estimated 100,000 children. </P>
        <P>However, an unacceptable number of children remain in consistent poverty and the Government remains focussed on further substantially reducing child poverty. The level of commitment in this area was particularly prominent in last week&rsquo;s Budget in which I announced a range of targeted measures and supports, costing over &euro;240 million, specifically to benefit children in low income families and families on welfare.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have long held the view that implementing a targeted second tier of payment for children in low income and welfare families is the most effective method of tackling child poverty. The significantly improved and targeted measures I announced last week represent a substantial move in that direction and that is why I took the decision to deliberately focus the increased child supports in the areas where we know child poverty exists.  The measures in Budget 2007 include, for the first time in over a decade, reform of the Qualified Child Allowance (formerly Child <Col N="1014"/>Dependant Allowance), which is seen as an important welfare weapon in tackling child poverty levels. The three existing rates of QCA have been combined into a new single high rate of &euro;22 per week that will benefit over 340,000 children of families on welfare. I am also increasing the rate of Child Benefit by &euro;10 &mdash; bringing new rates to &euro;160 and &euro;195 per month. The Child Benefit increases will apply to all children, benefiting over 560,000 families in respect of approximately 1.1 million children.</P>
        <P>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance provides additional income support for the poorest families at a particularly difficult time of the year. With this in mind, I am increasing the allowance by &euro;60 for children aged 2 to 11, and by &euro;95 for children aged 12 to 22, bringing the rates of payment to &euro;180 and &euro;285 respectively.  I have also made provision for additional funding of &euro;3 million to extend the School Meals Programme.  Other budgetary measures, such as the &euro;20 per week increase in the lowest social welfare rate to &euro;185.80 and increases in the earnings thresholds for One Parent Family Payment and Family Income Supplement, will also indirectly benefit children living in low income households.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The package of measures for children and families in Budget 2006 is in addition to recent initiatives such as the &euro;1,000 a year early childcare supplement for all children under 6 years and the creation of additional childcare places.  An example of how these Budget measures will significantly benefit low income and welfare families is the case of a Lone Parent, which is an area where child poverty is particularly prevalent, who is earning &euro;20,000 a year and who has one child aged 5. The additional income from social welfare entitlements, supports and allowances will further increase this families income in 2007 by &euro;9,646, with the increases announced in the Budget accounting for &euro;3,754 of that.</P>
        <P>In addition, preparation of a new National Action Plan for Inclusion is currently being coordinated by the Office for Social Inclusion in my Department for launch early in the new year. Building on the social inclusion provisions in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, the Plan will adopt a lifecycle approach by assessing the risks which individuals face at each stage of the life cycle and the supports they need to effectively meet these risks. The groups focused on using this approach are Children, People of Working Age, Older People and People with Disabilities. This strategic framework is also being designed to create more coherent and integrated structures that will greatly assist in achieving more effective implementation of the plan. It is also expected to facilitate better and more effective reporting and monitoring across the spectrum of government activity in the area of social inclusion.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 391 and 392 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for ensuring that penalty points are endorsed on a licence record. Data in relation to penalty points is held on the National Driver File, which is administered by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. <Col N="1016"/>The data does not include information relating to the vehicle or the ownership of the vehicle.</P>
        <P>Under EU legislation any driver with an EU licence is entitled to drive the categories of vehicle in respect of which that licence is granted throughout the EU without restriction. Drivers with non EU driving licences are entitled, under the International Circulation Order made under the 1949 Geneva Convention, to drive for a period of up to 12 months after which they are required to obtain an Irish licence if they have taken up residence. All drivers are subject to road traffic law and it is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the law. As foreign licence holders have no Irish driving licence penalty points are recorded against that person on a separate record in the National Driver File.</P>

	<P>The day to day operation of railway services is a matter for  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann however that train services on the Drogheda-Connolly line have been considerably expanded in recent years in response to growing passenger demand.  There are now a total of 59 daily services on the route compared to 42 in 2000.  Overall capacity has also been significantly increased with the introduction of 136 diesel mul<Col N="1018"/>tiple units between 2003 and 2005 which has almost doubled carrying capacity on the route.</P>
        <P>During 2007 the introduction of new Intercity railcars (for which funding has been included in the 2007 Estimates) on the Sligo line will enable further commuter railcars to be transferred to operate out of Drogheda to add further capacity to commuter services.  I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that services at peak times on the Drogheda-Connolly line can cause some discomfort and inconvenience to passengers but does not give rise to safety concerns.  Commuter railways throughout the world operate safely fully laden with standing passengers.  There are no national or EU regulations in relation to the number of passengers that can be carried on an individual railway carriage.  Irish Rail advises that it operates its rolling stock to approved design standards.</P>

	<P>The Community Development Programme was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling the causes and effects of poverty and disadvantage.  The Programme is designed to reduce social exclusion by targeting support at disadvantaged and socially excluded communities in order to improve their capacity to benefit from social and economic development.  My Department assumed responsibility for the Programme in June 2002.</P>
        <P>Projects within the Community Development Programme are funded on a contract basis, and are located in recognised disadvantaged urban and rural areas nationwide.  Some &euro;24 million has been allocated to the Programme in 2006.  Sixty-nine community development projects are based in the Dublin area in 2006, of a total of 182 projects nationwide.  Details of funding to these projects in the past five years can be found in the appendix.</P><Col N="1023"/>

The Strategy contains 108 individual actions, under the five pillars of supply reduction, <Col N="1028"/>prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  The actions outlined in the National Drugs Strategy are being progressed with the significant input of other Government Departments and Agencies, e.g. Health Services Executive, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, the Customs Service and F&Aacute;S.

	<P>The Joint Coastal Development Measure was introduced under the CL&Aacute;R Programme in July 2005.  The measure is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (D/CMNR) and supports minor repair and safety works on small piers, slipways and coastal erosion works in CL&Aacute;R areas, including Gaeltacht areas and islands. Selection of projects for funding is a matter for the D/CMNR.  </P>
        <P>In 2005, Schull Pier was identified by the D/CMNR as requiring urgent funding and, subsequently, a CL&Aacute;R grant of &euro;24,375 was allocated towards the overall cost of the project of &euro;65,000.  Alternatively, funding can be sought from the Islands Section, within my Department, which provides funding for ferry access piers situated on the islands and on the mainland serving the islands.  Funding is also available under the annual Islands Small Works Programme for minor improvements to local fishing piers on the islands.  The eligibility criteria used are that the island in question: must be permanently inhabited; must be cut off daily from the mainland by the tide; must not have a bridge connecting it to the mainland; and, must not be in private ownership.</P>

	<P>Since 1997, my Department and its predecessor, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, have provided in the region of &euro;6.5m for essential capital works on the islands off the County Cork coast.  These works included pier and road improvements, water supply, waste management, car parking facilities, village renewal and coastal protection.  Assistance is also available for the provision of community and recreational facilities and activities on the islands. It is intended to continue with this programme of investment in the islands over the coming years.</P>
        <P>My Department currently subsidises six ferry services in Co. Cork serving Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire, Sherkin, Bere, Whiddy, Heir and Long Islands at a total cost of over &euro;308,000 per annum.  In addition, earlier this year, I announced the establishment of a special Enterprise Scheme for non-Gaeltacht islands.  The purpose of this scheme is to stimulate the establishment and development of a varied range of enterprise activities in order to promote the long-term sustainable development of the islands.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta supports enterprise development on the Gaeltacht islands.</P>
        <P>I also launched a plan this year aimed at marketing the islands internationally as a niche product.

	<P>A group representing retired farmers lodged a petition with the European Parliament Committee on Petitions in May 2003, alleging that Ireland had not implemented correctly the Council Regulations governing the 1994 and 2000 Schemes of Early Retirement from Farming.  The Committee requested information from the European Commission.  In reply, the Commission made it clear that in its considered opinion there was no question of any infringement having been committed by Ireland in the implementation of the Schemes.  The Chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Petitions raised these issues with me again in a letter dated 5 September 2006, while acknowledging the view that the Commission had taken.</P>
        <P>A reply to the Chairman of the Petitions Committee is being prepared.  Most of the issues raised in his letter were also dealt with in the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture and Food.  Certain of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s recommendations are precluded by the EU Regulations under which the current Scheme and its predecessor are operated.  I saw merit in other aspects of the Committee&rsquo;s report; and some recommendations have been either fully or partially implemented and others will be considered in the context of the proposal for a new Early Retirement Scheme, which has been included in the draft Development Plan for the period 2007-2013.  Following clarification from the European Commission, I have also recently announced increases in the rate of pension under both Schemes.  These increases, which are financed entirely from the National Exchequer, will cost some &euro;33 million extra over the remaining period of the two Schemes, and some 5,000 retired farmers will benefit from them.</P>

	<P>As indicated in my earlier reply to the Deputy the person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category C.  Category C caters for farmers who sold their milk quota into the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. </P>
        <P>The person named sold his milk quota into a re-structuring scheme in April 2002 but he did not convert to a farming sector for which a direct payment under the Livestock and/or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable in respect of the years 2000 to 2002 and therefore did not satisfy the criteria for an allocation of entitlements under Category C.</P>

	<P>As indicated in my earlier reply to the Deputy the person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B.  Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002. Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.</P>
        <P>The person named was not considered eligible under the National Reserve as the investments did not commence prior to 19 October, 2003 and a letter setting out my Department&rsquo;s decision has issued to the person named.  Subsequently the person named submitted an appeal against this decision.  In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal, if any, are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision.  In this case the documentation was examined by my Department but it did not provide grounds for a change to the original decision.   This case was then forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee. On completion of their review the Independent Single Payment Appeals Committee will correspond directly with the person named.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A herd number is an administrative arrangement in place since the early 1950s and designed primarily for the purposes of disease control under the disease eradication schemes. The current legislative framework involves the allocation of a number to a herd as provided for under S.I. No. 276 of 1999 (European communities (Identification and registration of bovine animals) Regulations, 1999).  The traditional term &ldquo;herd-owner&rdquo;, which required the nomination of one person in respect of the herd in the 1989 TB Order, has been substituted by the term &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; which is defined in Regulation (EC) No. 1760/2000 as any natural or legal person responsible for animals, whether on a permanent or on a temporary basis, including during transportation or at a market. In effect, the &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; is the person who is to be the initial point of contact in regard to animal inspections, testing, identification, records etc. to sign movement documents passports of animal(s) and to be deemed legally responsible for the day to day care and welfare of the animals. The keeper also has responsibility to notify the database of animal births, deaths and movements, to keep the herd register and to sign certain documents such as the animal passport when the keeper takes possession of an animal.</P>
        <P>My Department, as a matter of policy, when issuing a herd number registers one individual person as the &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; of the animals. The designation of more than one person as &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; would lead to general confusion, possible denial of responsibility, duplication of communication to all named parties, difficulties in supply of identification tags and documents and difficulties in prosecutions, all of which could delay immediate action in relation to the prevention of the spread of animal disease and the protection of animal welfare.</P>
        <P>With regard to correspondence received by the person concerned from my Department, the position is that in a recent effort to align Department computer systems, to regularise records and to bring the terminology more into line with the EU regulations, in cases where multiple persons had been recorded and no single person was nominated as keeper, my Department issued a request to farmers to nominate one person as keeper for the herd.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The registration of a person as keeper does not infer ownership of the lands or animals in the herd. When multiple persons, a company, or an institution wish to register an interest in the herd number, they are registered as &ldquo;herd-owners&rdquo;. There is no legal obligation on each and every <Col N="1036"/>person who may have an interest in the herd number to so register but those who do are asked to nominate the keeper.  Indeed those persons on the Department&rsquo;s records registered as &ldquo;herd-owners&rdquo; may or may not be the legal or beneficial owners of the animals tested under the particular herd number as would for instance be the case where animals are boarded in a herd on a fee/head/day basis.  Ownership is a civil matter and it is not within the competence or remit of the Department to keep records of or determine legal ownership or beneficial interest in individual animals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the position of persons who have a beneficial interest in the herd but who are not registered as keepers, such persons may register their interest in the herd as &ldquo;herd-owners&rdquo; through Form ER1.1 and, accordingly, qualify for payment under the various schemes implemented by my Department. In this regard, I should emphasise that the &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; role is classified as a non-financial role and payments are only made to those who have registered as &ldquo;herd-owners&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of payment by marts, factories etc., since inclusion of a name on a cattle identity card does not denote ownership of an animal, the question of payment by the mart or factory is  a civil/commercial matter between the owners of  animals and the factory and it is advisable that with regard to the selling of animals to third parties, joint owners of animals have a formal arrangement in place with marts, factories etc. regarding the payment for these animals.</P>
        <P>In view of the fact that this policy has been in place for many years, I have asked my Department to have it reviewed.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 247 and 248 of 23 November 2006, the reason her Department did not issue a statutory notice under Section 25 of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966; if this section is still utilised by her Department; the number of times it has been used in the past 12 months; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The person mentioned failed to have conducted the tests required to maintain the <Col N="1038"/>health status of his herd and refused to comply with notices issued by my Department to have his herd tested for Bovine Tuberculosis and Bovine Brucellosis.  The herd belonging to this person was last tested for TB on 30 September 2004 and for Brucellosis on 27 September 2004.</P>
        <P>Section 25 of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 does not provide for a statutory notice to be issued. Rather it provides that an authorized person may enter a holding with a view to carry out such examinations, carry out tests, take samples etc as may be required by the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Further it requires any person owning or in charge of animals to carry out such instructions from an authorized person as may be necessary in connection with the furtherance of disease eradication.  In the case in question, in view of the fact that primary responsibility for carrying out TB and Brucellosis tests rests with herd-owners, an authorized officer of the District Veterinary Office served formal statutory notices under the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order 1989 and the Brucellosis in Cattle (General Provisions) Order 1991 on the person concerned requiring the tests to be carried out by 15 December 2005. To date, the person has not complied with these notices.</P>
        <P>Section 25 of the Disease of Animals Act is regularly used by my Department as the legal basis for Class B disease investigative purposes and also for tests under the TB and Brucellosis schemes conducted by veterinary inspectors employed by my Department and other authorized officers. It is furthermore the legal basis for persons to act for the purpose of eradication of a Class B disease and as such all persons authorized to act under the TB and Brucellosis Orders have been authorized under this Section.  Details of the number of times it has been used in the past 12 months are not kept centrally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to inform the Deputy that there are a number of legislative, operational and administrative changes under way which will see the transfer of responsibility for the detention of young offenders under 18 years of age, ordered to be detained by the Courts, from the Department of Education and Science and the Irish Prison Service to the Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department.  The Irish Youth Justice Service has been established as an executive office of my Department and is to, inter alia, manage detention services for young people under the age of 18 years.</P>
        <P>The net effect of these reforms to the detention services will be to end the practice of using adult prison places for the detention of children.  It will also see the extension of the children detention school model to all offenders, male and female, under the age of 18 years.   This will require the construction of children detention school places, with the requisite facilities to provide care and education, which can accommodate all 16 and 17 year olds ordered to be detained by the Courts.  The legislation, once commenced, includes arrangements for the use of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution on an interim basis. To facilitate this, work is well underway in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution for the separation of the majority of those under the age of 18 years from the older age groups.</P>
        <P>The transfer of the children detention schools, currently within the remit of the Department of Education and Science, to the Irish Youth Justice Service is intended to take place on the 1st of March, 2007. Currently the Irish Prison Service has responsibility for 16 and 17 year old children who have been ordered to be detained by the Courts.   In practice the majority of young offenders being detained are male and are detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, which is the designated detention centre for male offenders aged between 16 and 21 years of age.  In addition, current legislation allows all prisons in the State to accommodate persons aged 17 years and over.  The number and location of offenders, aged 16 and 17 years, in detention on 8 December, 2006, are set out in the following table.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that it is not the policy of my Department to compel autistic children to attend special schools when this is deemed inappropriate for those children.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism.</P>
        <P>A specific function of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, SENOs, is to identify appropriate educational placements for all children with special educational needs, including children with autism.  The NCSE, through the SENOs, continue to develop and co-ordinate additional provision, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders receive an education appropriate to their needs the following provision has been established: 178 Special Classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools; 5 special Classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome; 16 early intervention classes for children on the autistic spectrum; and 14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis, ABA, specific methodology on a pilot basis &mdash; 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.</P>

	<P>I do not propose to comment on the <Col N="1044"/>details of an individual case or on the amount of costs associated with such a case. However I would like to make some comments on the issue of litigation and children with special educational needs in general.</P>
        <P>Neither I nor my Department take lightly any decision to defend cases concerning children with special educational needs. Cases are generally only litigated where no potential settlement is acceptable to both sides and the Government&rsquo;s authority to decide issues of policy is in question. The State has an obligation under the Constitution to provide for primary education. In the context of children with special educational needs, that education must be appropriate to their requirements. The State decides on an appropriate form of provision, having regard to the advice available to it from relevant experts in the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the inspectorate and independent experts. The Department is not complacent in dealing with these cases and attempts, wherever possible, to reduce the potential for litigation and the levels of legal costs where they arise.</P>
        <P>People are free to sue the State where they wish to do so. When this happens, it is clearly proper and appropriate that the State should have available to it the necessary legal advice to make an informed decision on whether it should defend or settle litigation. Settlement of a case requires the agreement of both parties and in circumstances where one party is unwilling to settle then a case will proceed to hearing of the issues in question.</P>
        <P>The number of cases taken against the State has shown a downward trend in recent times which can be partly attributable to the substantial increase in resources. It is my belief that the establishment of the National Council for Special Education will further assist the reduction in litigation cases in providing, through its special education needs organisers, SENOs, a more focused and local response to individual needs.</P>
        <P>Finally the Deputy will be aware that provision of speech and language therapy and occupational therapy are the responsibility of the HSE. I would like to reiterate my commitment to the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special educational needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

	<P>From correspondence supplied by the Deputy it appears that the person in question made an application to the Residential Insti<Col N="1046"/>tutions Redress Board in relation to her period of residence in a Magdalen laundry in 1961-1962. </P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 financial awards are made to people who as children were abused while resident in institutions for which the State had a regulatory or supervisory responsibility. The scheme applies in respect of institutions which are listed in the Schedule to the Act.  The Magdalen laundries are not listed in the Schedule as these were not subject to State regulation or supervision.  However, Section 1(3) of the Act provides that children who were sent to the Magdalen laundries from an institution listed in the Schedule to the Act can be considered for financial redress if, as children, they were victims of abuse while resident in the laundries.  The justification for this provision is that the State was still responsible for the welfare and protection of children who were transferred to a Magdalen laundry from a State regulated institution.</P>
        <P>However, the situation in relation to children who were taken into the laundries privately or who entered the laundries as adults is quite different. The Magdalen laundries were privately owned and operated establishments which did not come within the responsibility of the State and, accordingly, women or children who were privately placed and resident in the laundries are not eligible for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
        <P>I should add that, in the Government&rsquo;s initiatives to address past abuse, the needs of those who suffered abuse in institutions not covered by the Act is recognised and provided for and a range of measures has been put in place to assist them.  These include the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, dedicated counselling services for victims of abuse and the amendment to the Statute of Limitations.</P>

        <P>Under the nationality requirement, students must hold E.U. Nationality, have Official Refugee Status or have been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; or be nationals of a member county of the European Economic Area, EEA, or Switzerland.</P>
        <P>Students must meet the nationality requirement at the time of entry or re-entry to an approved course.  However the Grants Schemes contain a &lsquo;change in circumstances&rsquo; clause which provides that a candidate&rsquo;s eligibility may be assessed or re-assessed in the event of a change in circumstances in relation to, inter alia, reckonable income, the number of dependant children, normal residence and nationality, where the candidate becomes an Irish national or the national of another EU member State.</P>
        <P>The &lsquo;change in circumstances&rsquo; provision allows candidates who acquire nationality through the naturalisation process, during the course of their studies, to apply to be assessed or re-assessed for grant assistance with effect from the academic term when the change occurs.</P>

	<P>New schools initially operate with provisional recognition from my Department. During the period of provisional recognition, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation. While schools with temporary recognition do not qualify for capital funding, my Department does provide grant aid for the rental of interim accommodation. It is open to a school to seek an increase in this rental as its needs develop. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have expressed a view on a number of occasions that some second-level schools do not appear to be doing as much as they could to welcome students with special needs.  I made a particular point of raising this when I attended the annual conferences of the education partners over the course of the year.</P>
        <P>It is the general position that a school cannot turn away a child solely because he or she has special needs.  A student may be refused enrolment on the basis of criteria in the school&rsquo;s published enrolment policy, such as those that relate to the school&rsquo;s catchment area, preference given to siblings of existing students etc., but the policy must be legal and cannot involve discrimination against special needs students.</P>
        <P>While the legal position on non-discrimination in enrolment policies is strong, some schools seem not to be officially refusing to take students with special needs but rather encouraging parents to apply elsewhere on the basis that another school would better meet their needs.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about this practice, particularly given all the extra investment that has been provided by this Government to ensure that all schools can cater for students with special needs.  In the current school year, more than 1,850 whole-time equivalent teachers and more than 1,350 special needs assistants have been allocated to second level schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of more than 200 teaching posts and more than 260 SNA posts on the previous school year.</P>
        <P>Of course, as well as the extra resources that have been provided in recent years, the process for accessing special needs supports has also been improved dramatically by the establishment of the National Council for Special Education and its teams of local organisers.  Schools now have a specific person to whom they can apply for supports based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual student.  All schools should see that there is now a strong system in place to ensure that special needs students get the additional resources they need.  It is necessary, <Col N="1050"/>however, for schools to be willing to be proactive and seek extra support from their local SENO.</P>
        <P>I also want all parents to be aware of both their legal rights and the fact that all schools have access to special needs supports, and will be asking the NCSE to assist in this regard.</P>
        <P>Far from leaving it to parents, as the Deputy implies, the Education Act 1998 actually empowers parents to pursue their rights and the rights of their children to fair and equal treatment when seeking enrolment in a school. With regard to parents who feel that their child has unjustly been refused a school place, they may appeal the school&rsquo;s decision to the Secretary General of the Department under section 29 of the Education Act 1998.  Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and, where an appeal is upheld, the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.</P>
        <P>With the improvements that have been put in place in recent years, students with special needs should not only be welcome in all schools but should be embraced as part of an inclusive and caring school community.</P>

	<P>Significant improvements in the levels of direct funding to second level schools have been made in recent years. The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding. There are however significant differences in the approaches to insurance cover. In my view it is important to consider these issues in the wider context of the equalisation of funding arrangements across the second level system.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools.

        <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement of further significant increases in the context of the 2007 estimates.

In addition, the support services grant will be increased by a further &euro;30 for voluntary secondary schools, which includes a further equalisation measure, to &euro;189 per pupil. For such schools this cumulative increase of &euro;48 per pupil will bring the aggregate grant to over &euro;500 per pupil from 1 January next. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and care-taking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this will bring annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;290,000.</P>

	<P>I am puzzled by the link made by the Deputy between the funding of school insurance costs in the voluntary schools and early retirement of teachers in that sector. </P>
        <P>All teachers, whether they are teaching in vocational, community and comprehensive or voluntary secondary schools have to deal with student discipline issues as part of their normal duties.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued guidelines to the Management Authorities of second level schools on meeting their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act to ensure the safety and health of their employees.</P>
        <P>The close interaction of the school management with staff and parents in developing effective school policies on school discipline, bullying and health and safety contributes to a positive school environment where mutual respect, co-operation and natural justice are accepted features of the school community by all.</P>
        <P>School Management Authorities are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school. The Code should be developed by the Principal and the staff in consultation with parents and approved by the School Management Authority. Parents should be circularised regarding the Code when it is finalised.</P>
        <P>This Code should have as its aim the maintenance of desirable standards of behaviour, particularly in fostering understanding and co-operation between teachers, pupils and parents in helping schools to adapt to the needs of its students while establishing the basis for responsible actions by its students and observing the principles of natural justice. Any sanction imposed on a pupil should be in accordance with the Code of Discipline. Procedures for suspending pupils should be clearly set out in the school&rsquo;s Code of Discipline and should be adhered to. Aggressive, threatening or violent behaviour towards a teacher is regarded as serious or gross misbehaviour and may warrant suspension.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board is currently working on revised Guidelines for Developing School Codes of Behaviour. This work is nearing completion and I expect that the revised Guidelines will be available in the new year.</P>
        <P>As a supportive resource, teachers can now access an Employee Assistance Service, EAS, specifically tailored to meet their particular needs. The EAS now available to teachers throughout the country is designed to support the health and well-being of teachers which will in turn positively affect work quality and performance. The service will incorporate confidential counselling on issues such as health, relationships, <Col N="1058"/>addictions, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma.</P>
        <P>Services include, single session or short term structured telephone counselling, face to face short term confidential counselling as well as critical incident debriefing.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year I announced an implementation strategy following publication of &ldquo;School Matters&rdquo; the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, and that strategy is now well advanced.</P>
        <P>At the core of the recommendations of the Task Force was the putting in place of a National Behaviour Support Service, NBSS. This has now happened with the appointment of a National Co-ordinator and four Assistant National Co-ordinators. In addition, nine Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates have been recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative. A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a senior psychologist and three psychologists. These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way. A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.</P>
        <P>Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues: the development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement; the development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and impact on classroom and whole school behaviour; on-going training for the NBSS team; and research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>The NBSS has commenced its engagement with schools and a series of information seminars have been organised throughout the country. Subsequently intensive work will begin with a smaller number of schools most in need of this intervention.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that this new service will work intensively with those schools initially selected for inclusion in this development. I have already announced that part of this work will see us testing the concept of a behaviour support classroom in up to 30 schools next year. I want to emphasise however that these classrooms cannot be, in themselves, a solution to the issue of poor student behaviour. They must be one part of a holistic response which should see a school, actively supported by the Behaviour Support Team, defining for itself a pathway to improvement.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement in the context of the 2007 Estimates, that I am providing &euro;8million to support the work of the NBSS, in helping schools promote positive student behaviour at second level.</P><Col N="1059"/>
        <P>A teacher may retire voluntarily where s/he has attained the necessary age or service threshold. A teacher on voluntary retirement does not have to specify a reason for choosing to retire at that time and is only required to give 3 months prior notice.</P>
        <P>With regard to teachers who retire under the Early Retirement Strands, Strand 1 is available to teachers who are consistently experiencing professional difficulties in their teaching duties; Strand 2 is available to teachers whose retirement will provide their school with an opportunity to enhance the education service provided through facilitating change and Strand 3 is for teachers in posts which are surplus to requirements.</P>

	<P>The sum of  &euro;33m is allocated in the 2007 Revised Estimates to Public Private Partnerships (PPP).  Estimated current expenditure is  &euro;24.9m.   This sum is in respect of the unitary payments due in 2007 for the five pilot PPP second level schools, the National Maritime College and the Cork School of Music, when completed. </P>
        <P>Capital expenditure is estimated to be &euro;8.1M.  This represents  the Construction VAT payable on the Cork School of Music PPP project.  It was decided prior to the commencement of the Pilot PPP Programme that the cost of VAT on the construction of PPP project would not be included in the unitary payments over 25 years and would be paid when the project is handed over on completion of construction. The Cork School of Music is due to be completed and handed over to my Department in October 2007.</P>

	<P>For every profession, it is important that its members have access to professional development and teachers are not an exception.  It can be argued that teachers, because of their key role in the preparation of students for their role in society, are one profession where such development is of critical importance.  Opportunities for professional development enable teachers to enhance their teaching and learning while continuing to provide a high quality of education and improved student outcomes.   </P>
        <P>This is why I was particularly proud to have launched the Teaching Council of Ireland earlier this year.  The Teaching Council is responsible, amongst a number of other issues, for the education and professional development of members of the teaching profession.  In addition, my Department has put in place a range of measures to assist the professional development of teachers.  The priority I attach to providing qual<Col N="1062"/>ity professional development for teachers is evident from the levels of funding provided in successive budgets for this purpose.  In general terms, my Department&rsquo;s Teacher Education Section supports the continuous professional development of primary and post-primary teachers through the establishment of National Programmes (dealing with new or revised curricula) and Support Services (covering a range of issues relating to teaching and learning).  In addition, the network of twenty-one Education Centres provides a wide variety of courses.  Teachers also have the opportunity to attend courses in a personal capacity and apply for a refund of fees in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s Teacher Fee Refund Scheme.  Furthermore, teachers can also avail of the arrangements operated by the Revenue Commissioners under which individuals can apply for a rebate of taxation of certain tuition fees.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The opportunities for professional development outlined above are open to all teachers but it should be noted that in some circumstances they only be applicable to teachers of a particular subject.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 461 to 463, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools <Col N="1063"/>under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The 1978 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
        <P>The 1978 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including secretarial services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving Boards of Management and schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided. The terms and conditions of employment are matters for agreement between the employee and the authorities of each school. The Department does not stipulate any rules concerning how the secretarial services are to be obtained by schools. Accordingly the arrangements are suited to local needs and are not standard across the sector.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for primary and voluntary secondary schools. In addition to the &euro;12 per pupil increase in 2006 in the standard per capita grant that now stands at &euro;298 per pupil, voluntary secondary schools have benefited additionally by the increase of &euro;14 per pupil in 2006 in the support services grant bringing the overall grant to &euro;159 per pupil.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement of further significant increases in the context of the 2007 estimates. From 1 January next the standard per capita grant for secondary schools will be increased by a further &euro;18 to &euro;316 per pupil. In addition, the support services grant will be increased by a further &euro;30 for voluntary secondary schools, which includes a further equalisation measure, to &euro;189 per pupil. For such schools this cumulative increase of &euro;48 per pupil will bring the aggregate grant to over &euro;500 per pupil from 1 January next. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and care-taking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this will bring annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;290,000.</P>
        <P>At primary level, the basic rate of capitation will increase by &euro;18 per pupil next year to a level of &euro;163.58 per pupil from January. The ancillary services grant will also increase by &euro;6.50 to &euro;145.50 per pupil. Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get &euro;24.50 extra per pupil to cover their day to day running costs next year, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting nearly &euro;7,400 extra next year. In fact, this 300 pupil school will get approximately &euro;93,000 from my Department next year to meet such costs.</P>
        <P>The provision that I have made, in the context of the 2007 estimates, for these significant increases in the funding of primary and voluntary <Col N="1064"/>secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

	<P>When the establishment of an Ionad N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Oideachais Gaeilge in Baile Bhuirne was announced in 1999 the intention was that it would function as a national centre of excellence to support the teaching of Irish and through Irish, and would engage with education institutions from pre-school to third level.  It was announced again on 12 June 2000 when the then Minister for Education and Science Dr. Michael Woods signalled the establishment of a &ldquo;&pound;1.5m all-Irish Education Centre&rdquo; on the occasion of the turning of the sod on the site on the grounds of Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in, Baile Bhuirne, Co. Cork. </P>
        <P>When the project went to tender, the construction costs were deemed excessive and it did not go ahead.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of developments since the original announcement.  Principal among these was the establishment of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta and the evolution of a new in-service model for teachers.</P>
        <P>There is an overlap between the functions of An Chomhairle and the functions envisaged for the Centre in Baile Bhuirne and this has to be addressed.  In addition, the new in-service model for teachers will prioritise regionalised access to a full spread of curriculum expertise through the regional education centre network.</P>
        <P>In order to clarify the specific rationale and function of the proposed Ionad N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Oideachais Gaeilge, officials from my Department together with officials from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs met with the interested parties in June of this year.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the views expressed by the interested parties at that meeting, I expect to be in a position very shortly to make a final decision on the project.</P>

        <P>The Youth Affairs Section of my Department administers the Special Projects for Youth Scheme.

        <P>It is open to the organisation in question to submit an application for funding under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in the 2007 round of grants.

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s Youth Affairs Section provides support for a number of schemes and initiatives designed to ensure the provision of non-formal educational opportunities for young people throughout the country. It provides grant-aid assistance for national and major regional youth organisations under the Youth Service Grant Scheme, for special projects for disadvantaged young people under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme and the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund. It also supports a range of other youth work programmes and initiatives inter alia Gaisce &mdash; the President&rsquo;s Award, L&eacute;argas &mdash; the Exchange Bureau and the National Youth Health Programme.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Youth Work Act, 2001, Vocational Education Committees (VECs) are to assume certain responsibilities for the provision of youth work programmes and services at local level including the drafting of three-year youth work development plans for their area. In drafting such plans, VECs are required to liaise with local youth work organisations and interests to ascertain the existing service provision and to identify any possible gaps or emerging needs.  In 2006 I have assigned  a number of youth officer posts to the VEC sector to carry out the designated VEC functions of the Act at local level.  The additional resources being provided to the VECs will facilitate a coordinated and appropriate youth work response to local needs.</P>
        <P>My Department recently appointed an Assessor of Youth Work. The Assessor will sup<Col N="1068"/>port the development of good youth work practice by monitoring and evaluating youth work projects and programmes supported by my Department. At present, the Assessor in consultation with the National Youth work Advisory Committee, NYWAC, is developing an Assessment/Quality Standards Framework. In a related development, my Department is at present in the process of establishing a National Youth Work Development Unit in the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, NUIM, with a remit of researching and developing guidelines for best practice in youth work, and managing and coordinating research as well as piloting innovation and new initiatives.</P>

	<P>The provision of a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school has been sanctioned for Phibblestown Dublin 15. This school has taken longer than expected due to difficulties in acquiring the site.

The site is almost 8.5 acres in size and the legalities on the site purchase will be completed by County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</P>
        <P>It is intended to progress the provision of the school as a Design Build Project. An advertisement was placed in the Official Journal of the European Union for design build teams and a project manager has also been appointed to manage the delivery of the project.</P>

	<P>My recent announcement referred to by the Deputy introduced a range of new measures to improve the capacity of schools to cater for the educational needs of all their pupils and will assist their principals in their work.</P>
        <P>Some principals have particularly heavy workloads arising from the size of their school. Others carry additional duties arising from the fact that in addition to their mainstream classes they have a significant number of special classes containing children with complex special needs. I am responding to these needs by the introduction of these new measures.</P>
        <P>The new measures include:</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The allocation of additional teachers to allow all deputy principals in schools with 24 or more mainstream class teachers operate as administrative deputy principals;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The allocation of additional teachers to allow deputy principals in mainstream schools that, in addition to their ordinary mainstream class teachers, also have five or more special classes for children with the more complex, low incidence, special needs, to operate as administrative deputy principals;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Where a school has a principal and four or five mainstream class teachers also has a specialist autism unit established under approval of the National Council for Special Education, the principal will be appointed on an administrative basis.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The role of the special needs assistant (SNA) is essentially a care one in supporting pupils with assessed special educational needs. The number and types of non-teaching staff in a primary school does not impact on the allocation of post of responsibility holders in a school, i.e., principal, deputy principal and special duties teachers.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the terms of Primary Circular 0023/2006, which sets out the details of the staffing schedule for the 2006/2007 school year, in ordinary primary schools and schools in the Gaeltacht with an enrolment of less <Col N="1074"/>than 179 pupils or in Gaelscoileanna with an enrolment of less than 158 pupils, that have a staffing of a Principal plus nine or more teachers when all ex-quota posts are counted, the Principal may be appointed as an Administrative Principal.  In such instances, a permanent mainstream class teacher may be appointed to replace the Principal.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I introduced a new measure on 12 November, 2006 whereby a school that has a Principal and four or five mainstream class teachers also has a specialist autism unit (2 or more autism classes) established under approval of the National Council for Special Education, the Principal will be appointed on an administrative basis.</P>
        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is classified as an ordinary primary school. There is one special autism class in the school.  The staffing in the school for the 2006/2007 school year is Principal, 4 Mainstream Class Teacher Posts, 1 Permanent Developing School Post, 2 Permanent Learning Support/Resource Posts and 1 Temporary Special Class post.</P>
        <P>As the school does not satisfy either of the two requirements as set out above, it does not qualify for the allocation of an Administrative Principal post at this time.</P>

The NCSE is currently arranging to fill the vacant posts, including the post referred to by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the two major investment priorities under the ICT in Schools Programme over the past two years have been the provision of grant aid to schools to develop their computer networks and the establishment of the Schools Broadband Network and the provision of broadband access to schools. In this context, the school concerned received a networking grant of &euro;2,200 in December 2004 and has had its broadband connectivity installed.</P>
        <P>The school concerned has written to my Department seeking financial support to update its ICT equipment.  I am aware of the benefits that good use of ICT can bring to our children&rsquo;s education and  I am conscious of the need for further investment to realise the full potential of integrating ICT into teaching and learning.   I intend to publish a comprehensive new ICT strategy in 2007 covering the period of the new National Development Plan to 2013.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that teaching practice is an integral part of the curriculum for the training of both primary and post-primary teachers. It is not a paid activity because it is viewed as training rather than employment. On that basis, my Department does not provide special financial <Col N="1078"/>assistance for students towards costs associated with teaching practice.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that teacher education programmes provided in approved third level institutions are, however, approved courses for the purposes of the Higher Education Grants Scheme. Under the terms of the Scheme, grant holders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as part of their course of study may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner.  Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department allocates funding each year to third level institutions under the Student Assistance Fund. This fund is available in order to assist students who may be experiencing difficulties in continuing their studies because of financial hardship. The disbursement of this funding is a matter for individual institutions in line with guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department has no plans at present to introduce a scheme of financial assistance, over and above the current provision, for trainee teachers to cover costs associated with teaching practice.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to initiating and managing ongoing programmes of in-service training and professional development for teachers of pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with autistic spectrum disorders, through an expanding range of accredited courses in Colleges and Third-Level Institutions and in the development of support programmes and services, my Department continues to provide support for teachers in their ongoing professional development. A strategy has been developed, which combines a number of elements as follows.</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A new combined post-graduate diploma programme of in-service education is being offered to teachers in the current school year.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />From 2001, a Graduate Certificate Course in the Education of Pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorders has been available at St. Patrick&rsquo;s College Drumcondra.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A one-year programme, running from September to June and leading to a Masters in Special Educational Needs is provided at St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My Department supports the training and professional development of staff working with children with special educational needs through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was established in 2003. The service as appropriate, consolidates co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings. Generally this support is provided by direct training input or sanction for school staff to attend courses recognised and funded through the SESS.</P>
        <P>As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the SESS is currently developing teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas, one of which is Autism. This training will be delivered locally through the Education Centre network and/or through whole-staff in-school support.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department supports a multi-skills approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available e.g. Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The SSP will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s Regional Offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The closing date for receipt of review applications was 31 March, 2006.  The Group have submitted a final report and the review is now concluded.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included under the DEIS action plan. These comprised 670 primary schools and 203 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>A number of urban primary schools included in Band 2 of the programme applied for review and a number of these were successful and were identified for inclusion in Band 1. The remaining Band 2 schools, that had not applied for review, were then afforded the opportunity of applying for a review. Completed applications for review had to be submitted by 25 September 2006.  The <Col N="1081"/>review process for these applications has now been completed and schools will be notified of the outcomes shortly.</P>

The closing date for applications is 31 January 2007. All applications received will be referred to the New <Col N="1082"/>School Advisory Committee for their consideration.</P>
        <P>The criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools were revised in 2002 based on the recommendations of a report of the Commission on School Accommodation, on which the Education Partners were represented.</P>
        <P>Applications for the recognition of new primary schools are assessed by an independent advisory board (the New Schools Advisory Committee) on the basis of the facts provided by the patron body in support of the case for the new school and the likely demand for places. Schools are granted provisional recognition and permanent recognition follows when long term viability has been established on actual enrolments over a period.</P>
        <P>Under this process all patron bodies are treated on an equal footing regardless of whether they are denominational, inter-denominational or multi-denominational. The Committee&rsquo;s annual programme of work culminates in a report with recommendations on the granting of recognition to application.

	<P>An assessment is being carried out by the Department to strategically examine the extent of multi-denominational provision in the Dublin 9 area.  It will also determine long term requirements and how these should best be addressed.  The issue of permanent recognition for the school in question will be visited once this assessment has been completed.</P>
        <P>While schools with temporary recognition do not qualify for capital funding, the Department does provide grant aid for the rental of interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and the Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation for the school. Teacher salaries, capitation grants and school transport costs are also paid for eligible pupils.</P>

	<P>I want to assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to doing everything that we can to reduce the number of children with serious reading difficulties. We are very conscious of the fact that good levels of literacy and numeracy are fundamental prerequisites for full educational and social participation, and we have intensified our efforts. As the Deputy will be aware, a general allocation system has been introduced to provide teacher support to all mainstream primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, that is, pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs.  This model was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils with these special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Second-level pupils with reading difficulties are normally integrated into ordinary classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support from the remedial/learning support teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.  Primary and second-level schools may apply to the local special educational needs organiser, an official of the National Council for Special Education, for additional teaching support in respect of pupils that satisfy the criteria for such support on account of their special educational needs. I am particularly conscious of the need for extra support for children in disadvantaged areas who are more at risk of having reading difficulties. A key underlying principle of DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion that I launched last year, is that of early intervention. It focuses on identifying and assisting children who are having difficulty with reading and writing at an early stage with the aim of preventing literacy difficulties from becoming entrenched.</P>
        <P>Children in DEIS schools that are identified as having major reading difficulties will be targeted early on to benefit from intensive, individualised literacy tuition through the Reading Recovery programme. This programme, under which each child is/can be provided with 2.5 hours of extra reading tuition a week, has been extremely positively received since its introduction a few years ago. The number of schools participating in the programme has already been doubled from 66 in 2004 to 136 in 2006. Access to Reading Recovery is being rolled out to all of the more than 330 urban primary schools participating in DEIS. Children with writing difficulties in these schools will also be targeted for extra support through the roll-out of the First Steps Programme to all urban primary DEIS schools. Taken together, the expansion of these two programmes, will signifi<Col N="1084"/>cantly improve the service available to children with literacy difficulties in disadvantaged areas. These measures will also be augmented by other extra supports being put in place under DEIS such as smaller classes at primary level, an expansion of the Home School Community Liaison scheme, a new initiative on pre-service and in-service professional development for teachers, and more school libraries at second level.</P>
        <P>What is also very important is that there will be a much greater focus on target-setting and planning under DEIS to ensure that the substantial extra resources being provided will lead to better outcomes for children. In this context, the School Development Planning service will support schools in developing their plans and policies for teaching literacy and numeracy and in setting measurable targets for the reduction of serious literacy and numeracy difficulties. Of course as well as improving the supports we provide in our schools, we all know that initiatives that help parents with any literacy problems that they may have themselves can have a hugely positive effect on their children&rsquo;s achievement. For this reason, the establishment of a new family literacy project is also a key priority under the DEIS programme. The project will build on previous experience in this area and will be based on a partnership approach involving the VEC adult literacy services, Home School Community Liaison teachers and the National Adult Literacy Agency.</P>
        <P>In this context, the Deputy will be aware that this Government has dramatically improved the level of provision for adult literacy training in recent years. Indeed, expenditure on adult literacy has increased by more than twenty-fold since we came into office &mdash; from &euro;1 million in 1997 to &euro;23 million in 2006. As a result of this dramatic increase in funding, we have been able to expand the number of people receiving adult literacy training, to the point where 35,000 people will receive a service in 2006. I believe that this unprecedented level of investment in adult literacy services will not only bring major benefits for the adults themselves, but will make a positive difference to their children&rsquo;s lives. Helping a parent to be able to read to their child could be one of the best things that we as a Government can do for both parent and child. So, as I have outlined, not only has this Government done a lot in recent years to improve the literacy levels of our children, we have intensified our efforts. I am confident that taken together, the initiatives that I have outlined will ensure a much greater level of support for children with literacy difficulties, and that achievement will improve considerably as a result.</P>

	<P>The latest data published by my Department on retention rates in second-level schools relate to the cohort of entrants to the first year of junior cycle in 1996. Students in this cohort would have sat the Leaving Certificate in either 2002 or 2003, depending on whether they took the Transition Year Programme. The published data for the 1996 cohort indicate an average &ldquo;unadjusted&rdquo; retention rate to Leaving Certificate of 70.3% for the local authority area of South Dublin, as compared with a national average figure of 77.8%. The term &ldquo;unadjusted&rdquo; relates to the fact that the figures cited have not been adjusted to allow for factors such as persons opting to pursue their senior cycle education in private institutions, emigration and death. The national adjusted Leaving Certificate retention rate for the 1996 cohort was 81.3%. </P>
        <P>As regards those who complete the Junior Certificate but who depart from second-level education prior to the Leaving Certificate, the available statistical evidence indicates that the increasing range of further education and training opportunities available for these students is having a positive impact. CSO data show that the educational profile of 20-24 year olds in Ireland has improved steadily over the last five years, as increasing opportunities have been made available in the further education and training sector. By 2005, almost 87% of 20-24 year olds had completed upper second-level education or higher, up from some 82% in 2000.  This compares with an EU average of 77% in 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the clear link between leaving the system without formal qualifications and continued socioeconomic disadvantage in adult life, the Government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that children and young people get the opportunities and supports they need to enable them to complete their education and secure their future economic and personal well being. Against the background of our continuing economic success, our increasingly well educated population (with almost 40% of 25-34 year olds having a third-level qualification, among the highest in the EU) and inward migration, those who leave school early without adequate qualifications face serious difficulties and challenges. My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. We established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school. We have widened the range of curricula available to students by promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula.</P><Col N="1086"/>
        <P>We have also put preventative measures in place such as the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL). Under the School Completion Programme children at risk of early school leaving are targeted for a variety of extra supports, educational and non-educational, during and outside of school time &mdash; all aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme helps to get parents involved in their children&rsquo;s education, which as we all know is a crucial component of convincing young people of the value of education. Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being implemented at present.  The action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multifaceted and more integrated approach.   This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.</P>
        <P>In relation to second chance educational opportunities for young people who left school early, this Government has shown a sustained commitment to providing greater opportunities in the adult and further education sectors. Many such young people take up places in Youthreach centres, while others pursue options such as F&Aacute;S apprenticeships. I would like to assure the Deputy that we have greatly intensified our efforts in recent years both to keep more young people in school and to provide increased educational opportunities for those who left school early. I will continue to prioritise further progress in this area. To that end the total provision in the 2007 estimates for educational inclusion programmes at all levels is &euro;730 million &mdash; an increase of &euro;95 million, or 15% on the 2006 figure.  The 2007 provision includes a 20% increase in funding for the NEWB.</P>

	<P>All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS and full details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. NEPS does not keep <Col N="1087"/>waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. </P>
        <P>The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools last year, supported by the provision of over 600 extra resource teachers, means that children with high incidence special needs now longer have to wait for an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support. Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist. In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.</P>

	<P>Kilkenny Castle is a national monument in the ownership of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and under the management of the Office of Public Works.  An application by Kilkenny Borough Council for consent under the National Monuments Acts to provide new public toilets on State owned property within the Castle grounds was refused by my Department on 30 June 2006. This refusal was because the proposed works, which included the breaking of a number of new openings in the wall, were considered to constitute an undue interference with a landmark national monument in State ownership.      </P><Col N="1093"/>
        <P>In response to a notification of new development proposals put forward by the Borough Council under the Planning and Development Acts and Regulations, my Department advised on 30 November 2006 that it is amenable to the removal of the existing public toilets at The Parade on the basis that such removal would have a positive impact on the amenity of the national monument.  My Department, in consultation with the Office of Public Works, is willing to continue to discuss with Kilkenny Borough Council the development of mutually acceptable proposals in relation to the Parade and other areas in the vicinity of the Castle, but which will not damage or otherwise interfere with the integrity of the national monument.</P>

	<P>Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006 applies to an application for permission for the development of houses on land that has been zoned for residential development or for a mix of residential and other uses.  It does not, therefore, apply to unzoned land.  Under the Acts, the definition of a house <Col N="1094"/>means a building, which is being or has been occupied as a dwelling, or is provided as use as a dwelling.  It is a matter for the relevant planning authority to determine what planning applications are subject to Part V.</P>

While my Department is currently compiling figures to the end of September 2006, data supplied by the local authorities indicate a provisional outturn of some 1,390 units acquired under Part V.  This represents a 64% increase on the same period last year and exceeds the twelve months output in 2005.

	<P Just="Left">The programme referred to in the Question is the erection of a medium-disturbance deer fence over an area of some 150 hectares in the oak woodlands of <Col N="1096"/>Killarney National Park.  The fencing is being undertaken with the agreement and financial support of the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture and Food under the Native Woodlands Scheme.  It is an objective of EU and national habitats policy that appropriate steps should be taken to avoid the deterioration of natural habitats such as the old oak woodland.  The erection of the fencing within this area of Killarney National Park is necessary because the presence of deer and feral goats has resulted in there being virtually no natural regeneration of native trees and no young or medium-aged oak trees in the woodland.  The Forest Service has estimated that, unless this problem is addressed, there will be little or no oak woodland in the area in 80 or 90 years&rsquo; time.  Furthermore, the Forest Service and my Department consider that the erection of the fencing is the only viable way to restore semi-natural woodland to this area.  I am satisfied that the fencing programme is essential for the survival of this woodland and is not in breach of the Park&rsquo;s protective designations.</P>

	<P>My Department has facilitated standardised arrangements with a number of the main financial institutions who have introduced schemes of mortgage financing for persons wishing to access affordable housing.  These arrangements relate only to the first time purchase of affordable properties.</P>
        <P>The question of facilitating arrangements for persons in affordable housing also wishing to re-mortgage with private lenders has been the subject of discussions between my Department and a number of the financial institutions.  The current practice requires that if a private lender agrees to provide re-mortgage finance it will be on the basis that their mortgage charge will rank below the clawback charge where such a charge exists.  This is consistent with the Land Registry system on property charges which are time sensitive and means the older the charge the higher is its ranking.</P><Col N="1097"/>
        <P>It has not been possible to agree a standardised approach on the basis of the above.  Notwithstanding this, my Department has no objection to a local authority allowing the re-financing of its mortgage, on an individual basis, through a private lender so long as the clawback provision is fully protected.  It is a matter for the local authority in such cases to ensure that the clawback can be imposed as provided for in legislation.</P>

	<P>The Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing came into effect on 13 April 2005.  Their purpose is to achieve a balance between the accommodation of rural housing needs and the requirements of sustainable development in economic, social and environmental terms.  The Guidelines provide that reasonable proposals on suitable sites for persons who are part of, and contribute to, the rural community should be accommodated. </P>
        <P>Suggested categories include persons who are an intrinsic part of the rural community such as farmers and their families, people who have lived most of their lives in rural areas and returning emigrants.  Other suggested categories include persons working full-time or part-time in rural areas such as those involved in farming, forestry, inland waterway or marine related occupations, and people whose work is intrinsically linked to rural areas, such as teachers in rural schools.</P><Col N="1104"/>
        <P>The Guidelines make clear that the foregoing list is not intended to be exhaustive and that it is a matter for each planning authority to make its own assessment of the scope and extent of rural housing needs to be catered for in its development plan, taking account of local conditions and relevant planning issues.  Also, as regards rural areas which are under strong urban influence, the Guidelines recommend that the development plan policies make a distinction between urban and rural generated housing in those rural areas closest to large urban areas, in order to avoid ribbon and haphazard development.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines are a material consideration both in relation to development plans and in the consideration of planning applications.  The detailed application of the guidelines to particular planning cases is however a matter for the planning authority concerned or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate.</P>

	<P>Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006 requires, inter alia, that up to 20% of land zoned for residential developments or for a mix of residential and other uses, is to be reserved to meet social and affordable housing needs.  Instead of the transfer of land there are other options available to satisfy the Part V requirement viz.  the provision of new units or other lands within the functional area of the local authority; the transfer of fully or partially serviced sites to the local authority or to an approved housing association, the payment of money in lieu of land or a combination of the above.  As a matter of policy, my Department has made it clear that local authorities should regard the early delivery of completed homes as a priority, when they are  concluding Part V agreements.</P>
        <P>The legislation requires, inter alia, that where a local authority consent to the use of one of the alternative options available to meet the Part V requirement, the aggregate monetary value of the option being agreed to must, in all cases, be equivalent to the monetary value of the land that the planning authority would receive if the agreement provided solely for the transfer of land.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s most recent Part V guidelines issued on 27 November 2006 stated, inter <Col N="1105"/>alia, that equivalent monetary value can be achieved through acceptance of a percentage of the total units on-site based on the percentage unit requirement in the relevant housing strategy. The guidelines were prepared following discussions with local authorities and the home building industry.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 546 and 548 together. </P>
        <P>Local housing strategies, provided for under the Planning and Development Act 2000, determine housing requirements under local development plans.  In developing these strategies, local authorities must ensure that there is an appropriate mix of dwelling types and sizes to cater for a range of housing needs.</P>
        <P>My Department has been reviewing the guidelines on residential density with a view to updating them later this year to achieve higher residential density of a suitable scale at appropriate locations.  The updating of the guidelines will in particular focus on the quality of new developments and will take account of the extensive experience built up since the introduction of the guidelines in the design, assessment and development of higher density proposals.  The revised guidelines will also reflect the need to promote the building of sustainable communities, particularly in terms of adequate facilities, amenities, schools, transport and leisure infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In addition, new Housing Policy Framework: Building Sustainable Communities was published in December 2005.  This sets out an agenda for an integrated package of policy initiatives on matters which include supporting higher densities and compact urban settlement through design innovation in the creation of new homes, new urban <Col N="1106"/>spaces and new neighbourhoods, whilst also ensuring an appropriate mix of dwelling types and sizes to cater for a range of housing needs.  My Department has also commissioned a research study into apartment size and space standards, which will inform the revised planning guidelines on residential densities.  The thrust of these will focus on the need to ensure that apartments are family-friendly, both in terms of their overall floor area and also facilities such as storage space and external play areas. Guidance will also be included on best practice mechanisms in the effective linkage of the development of new residential areas with the provision of wider social infrastructure such as schools and amenities.</P>
        <P>In response to the question on what constitutes a housing unit, my Department receives data from ESB Networks on the number of new meters installed into newly built residences, and these data form the basis for the number of housing units completed.  These units include apartments, and single or multiple bedroom houses.</P>
        <P>We are currently building housing units at the rate of over 20 homes for every 1,000 persons living in Ireland.  This is well ahead of the building rate in the European Union and has been achieved during a time of high economic growth and full employment. In fact only four years ago the rate of house building was running at 15 units per 1,000 persons.  Household size has also been falling with the 2002 Census figures revealing on average 2.9 persons from over 3.5 twenty years ago. These data in themselves suggest that the housing stock is well positioned to meet the needs of different family sizes.</P>
        <P>With the support of a range of policy initiatives and measures, my Department will continue to work with planning authorities to ensure that the unprecedented rate of population growth and housing development, currently being experienced in Ireland, is planned for in a manner that will, over the longer term, support a more balanced regional development and the creation of sustainable communities.</P>

        <Quest> if he has satisfied himself that the quality of all modern apartment blocks or affordable housing meets the desired quality standards and building regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The national Building Regulations operative from 1 June 1992 apply to all new buildings and existing buildings which have been the subject of a material alteration.  Responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations is a matter for the builder and the <Col N="1107"/>owner of a building, while enforcement of the Regulations is the responsibility of the local building control authorities.  Accordingly, all affordable housing developments and apartments must meet the relevant requirements of the Building Regulations. In addition, my Department has issued guidance documentation on Part V, which recommends that affordable housing acquired under Part V should also adhere to my Department&rsquo;s Design Guidelines for Social Housing. </P>
        <P>In relation to apartments, my Department commissioned research on apartments size and space standards earlier this year.  The outcome of this research has informed the preparation of Draft Guidelines on Apartments Size and Design Standards which will very shortly be issued for public consultation.  The new Guidelines will replace the existing guidance contained in the 1995 Guidelines on Residential Developments in Urban Renewal Designated Tax Incentive Areas.</P>
        <P>The new Guidelines will also form part of a suite of guidance documents which will replace the existing 1999 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density.  The suite will include guidelines on new residential developments and a new best practice handbook on urban design and housing layouts, which will illustrate how the policies set out in the planning guidelines might be implemented, with examples drawn from current practice.</P>
        <P>The guidance will take account of experiences to date with the 1995 and 1999 guidelines, the rapidly changing demographics and settlement patterns, the need for more compact urban development (particularly within the Greater Dublin Area) and the on-going policy of delivering sustainable communities and enhancing quality of life.</P>
