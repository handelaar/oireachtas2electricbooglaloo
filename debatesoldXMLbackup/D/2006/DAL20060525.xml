   <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent public and national importance, namely, the failure of the Government to provide a good quality health service and its total failure to address the crisis in accident and emergency units in hospitals throughout the country over the past nine years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, the necessity to reduce primary school class sizes, particularly in view of the fact that they are the second largest in the EU; the abandonment of the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to ensure that &ldquo;the average size of classes for children under 9 will be below the international best-practice guideline of 20:1&rdquo;; the dramatic 45% increase to over 108,000 in the number of primary school children being taught in classes of over 30 pupils; the fact that 15% of primary school children transfer to secondary school with literacy problems; and the need for the Government to reduce significantly mainstream class sizes over the next two years as a matter of urgency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent national and local importance, namely, the need to implement the recommendations contained in the report produced by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al on rheumatology services, including budgets and the timeframe for the roll-out of the identified needs and recommendations. Ireland currently has the lowest number of rheumatolog<Col N="710"/>ists per head of population, because most of the consultant rheumatologists employed by our public hospitals also take part in accident and emergency calls, thereby further reducing their availability to those in need. Diagnosis and timely intervention for patients affected by the disease produce far better outcomes and it is therefore critical that there be no delay in delivering on the recommendations in the report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of major importance, namely, the question of why raw sewage is still flowing at Achill Sound, County Mayo, due to the failure of successive Governments to provide any sewage scheme whatsoever at Achill Sound; and the imposition of the polluter-pays principle by Government. The imposition of this principle has struck a fatal blow to any chance of stopping the raw sewage pouring into the sheltered Achill bay due to the impossibility of the Achill community being able to provide the local contribution required under the polluter-pays principle because of the total economic neglect of Achill by successive Governments. The contribution is a requirement for businesses but there are no businesses in the locality.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of local and national importance requiring urgent attention, namely, the need to introduce routine immunisation of babies against pneumococal meningitis as this tragic disease has a high rate of fatality &mdash; approximately 20% &mdash; and is associated with a higher risk of permanent neurological damage, such as deafness and epilepsy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>
   </Speaker>
 </MainHeading>
 <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 3, Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, resumed; and No. 19, European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, resumed, to be taken not later than 1.30 p.m., and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no proposals to put to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said yesterday that the Prison Service was checking the number of prisoners who would be affected by the Supreme Court decision. Can the T&aacute;naiste update us on this? Has the Government any information on the number of people currently going through the system who might be affected?</P>
    <P>Taking into account that sentencing was adjourned yesterday because of the case taken <Col N="711"/>under the 1935 Act, pending action by the Government, I believe this matter is serious. It is not party political and it is in the people&rsquo;s interest that young persons be protected.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is outside the Order of Business. Allow the T&aacute;naiste to respond.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation was promised yesterday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me finish. This is a serious matter and I will not play party politics with the Ceann Comhairle. I want to make the point that, yesterday, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would allow a simple question. The Deputy asked a simple question on whether the T&aacute;naiste could update him on yesterday&rsquo;s developments &mdash; I will allow that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Ceann Comhairle wants to get into a row with me, he can. I am going to ask my question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair does not want rows with anybody, the Chair just wants to be fair to every Member.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be fair to the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If I allowed the Deputy to ramble all over the place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not ramble on about a matter of very serious import.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I could not stop anybody in the House, on either side.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked a question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not ask a question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Chair will allow it although it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked one question and want to ask another.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am allowing the question the Deputy asked.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Chair wants to stop me asking questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to stop the Deputy at all.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I will continue to stand here and make my point, which is as follows&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="712"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The same rules apply to Deputy Kenny as to every other Member. Standing Order 26 applies and the Chair appeals to Members to change it if they are not happy with it, after which the Chair will implement the change.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask a question on legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can ask a question on legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In the interest of supporting what the Government intends, will the T&aacute;naiste or Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform assure us the legislation proposed by the Government will be introduced as soon as possible, that is, in three weeks&rsquo; time, if not next week? Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe has produced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, I understand that seven people are in prison on the basis of being convinced under section 1(1) of the 1935 Act. They are in custody solely on that basis. The prison authorities are in discussion with the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General about those people. In addition to them, others affected by the Supreme Court judgement are persons charged under section 1(1) of the Act who are on bail, persons charged who are being remanded in custody pending trial, persons found guilty of an offence under section 1(1) of the Act who are awaiting sentence, persons who have completed a sentence on the basis of a conviction under section 1(1) of the Act who are subject to reporting requirements to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Sexual Offenders Act 2001, and persons who have completed a sentence on the basis of a conviction and have a criminal offence recorded against them. I do not have the numbers for persons in that category.</P>
    <P>On the legislation, I very much appreciate the support of the Deputy and the commitments he made yesterday and today on this matter. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will brief the Cabinet on Tuesday and the intention is to have legislation in about a fortnight. Given the complexity of the legislation and what we are seeking to deal with, that is reasonable in the circumstances. We would wish to have it today but that is not possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has given us figures for imprisoned persons, but she does not have the figures for the other categories affected? I find that surprising in the sense that the Government would have been aware that this case was before the Supreme Court. It does not seem unreasonable to have expected that someone would have been monitoring what might happen in the event of the case being decided in the manner in which it has. Quite clearly, if an offence is deemed <Col N="713"/>unconstitutional, the trial and conviction is invalid, as is the subsequent imprisonment. I heard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a brief question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;this morning on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; explaining that the Chief Justice had warned of making haste slowly on this. However, this month last year, we took all sections of two different Bills, without notice, from Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a brief question on the issue? We are outside the Order of Business, but I will allow the Deputy a brief question. We cannot have a full debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We took the British and Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill without notice through all Stages in the morning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Rabbitte to obey the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely the Government is agreed that we want to avoid the ludicrous position of people who must now be released finding themselves in a position to take an action against the State for wrongful imprisonment if they are not released.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to move on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What I am trying to establish is when the necessary legislation in this case is being brought before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Sexual assault is an alternative charge and an alternative verdict that can be made in these cases. That is important to recognise. As I have said to Deputy Kenny, it is intended that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will discuss this matter at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, and we expect to have legislation within a fortnight.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely it was reasonable to expect in a case of this moment, having regard to the law reform recommendation of 1990 and other considerations, that somebody would have been monitoring the case and that the Government would have been prepared for this situation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. There is no provision for Leaders&rsquo; Questions today.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On the arms trade, namely, the export of military goods valued at &euro;30 million and &euro;4 million in dual use goods from Ireland every year, I see we have a control of exports Bill but, <Col N="714"/>given that no date is indicated, could this matter be dealt with under the defence (amendment) Bill which is coming before the House this session? I want to ask about those two Bills in case there is any change in what I have before me here.</P>
    <P>The Inequalities in Mortality report, published in 2001 by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, highlights how the lowest occupational class&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy come to the legislation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;registers 100% to 200% more in terms of mortality than the highest occupational class.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to move on. I will allow the first question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The health Bill is on the promised legislation list and that is what I am asking about.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but the Deputy cannot make a Second Stage speech.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It talks about establishing a health information and quality authority. Can we ensure that an equality authority is included given that inequality in society is causing people to die in greater numbers?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the control of exports Bill, it is not possible to say at this stage. I have published the heads of the health Bill for consultation and we will have the legislation later this year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does equality come into it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of entitlements requires different legislation which we will have later in the year as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Inequality is a problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the business improvement districts Bill be published or will it be enacted in this session? When is the consumer protection Bill to establish the national consumer agency likely to be published given that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment thought it was urgent last November?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The business improvement districts Bill will appear this session. The heads of the other Bill have yet to go to Cabinet, so I am not in a position to say when we will have it. I understand it may be later this year, perhaps.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that children with special needs are being provided with taxi travel arrangements by Bus &Eacute;ireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="715"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the question on legislation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes it is. They are provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann with taxi arrangements&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to come to the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but the taxi drivers are not subject to any vetting or clearance procedures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not having an omnibus Question Time this morning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>At what stage is the register of persons considered unsafe to work with children Bill because parents are very concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that there is no vetting of the taxi drivers involved? It is a perfectly reasonable question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume her seat and allow the T&aacute;naiste to answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for drafting that legislation has now moved to the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and he is working on it. However, I have not got a specific date when we will have it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste not consider it urgent for the safety of special needs children?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very fortunate to receive a letter yesterday from the parliamentary affairs division of the Health Service Executive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle will be delighted to know that it does and that it falls well within his remit. It refers to the way that parliamentary questions are dealt with in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will move on. I call Deputy Bruton.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle might let me finish. The problem about this parliamentary question is that it was tabled&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have to find another way to raise this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;almost a year ago. I got an apology for the delay.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="716"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must allow his colleague, Deputy Bruton, to speak.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is the way the Ceann Comhairle believes parliamentary questions should be dealt with in this House, it is about time the T&aacute;naiste recognised that the system operating in the Department of Health and Children is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume his seat and allow Deputy Bruton.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask about promised legislation and the pharmacy (No. 2) Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I might come back to the Deputy later, but not now. I call Deputy Bruton.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will hear about the pharmacy (No. 2) Bill, which is within her remit, when the T&aacute;naiste is ready.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the legislation the T&aacute;naiste has published on nursing home subventions, when will we see the report of the working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach on the support of persons with long-term needs, because it is very difficult to debate one without the other?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will be published during June. Further proposals must go to the Cabinet in June and I hope to publish the report at that point. The report has been the basis of discussion at the social partnership talks as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the dangerous condition of Skerries and Balbriggan harbours, will we have to wait until the harbours Bill is introduced before this matter is resolved and we get funding from the Departments to deal with the issue? When will the harbours Bill be published?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Next year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan had a question on the pharmacy (No. 2) Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That means it will not be enacted in the life of this Government. I hope the people of north County Dublin will not have to wait until the harbours fall in before receiving funding. It is an utter disgrace.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume his seat. Deputy Durkan had a question on legislation and we said we would call him again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I had only one question, but now I have two&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must confine his question to legislation.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="717"/>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as regards the pharmacy (No. 1) Bill and pharmacy (No. 2) Bill, which is much sought after by the industry. Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste might deal with those.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the pharmacy (No. 1) Bill were cleared by Cabinet recently and I hope to publish them next week for consultation. We hope to have the Bill in the House later this year. The pharmacy (No. 2) Bill, which deals with more technical rather than regulatory issues to do with the profession, will be ready later this year or early next year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the long wait and the difficulties couples face when adopting, when will the Hague Convention adoption authority Bill be brought into the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Later this year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of questions. The Taoiseach promised an inspectorate for social services. The T&aacute;naiste said this morning the heads of the health Bill were published for consultation, but she did not indicate when we would see it in the House. When will that happen? When will we see the report on the Leas Cross nursing home? It seems&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should confine herself to questions. Some of her colleagues would like an opportunity to ask questions and I would like to facilitate them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

   <Title>Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la will decide if the infrastructure in question is of strategic importance, having regard to criteria which are listed in the Bill. The remit of the board is being expanded to include approvals of railway orders, including those relating to the Luas and metro systems. A specialised consent procedure for major electricity transmission lines is also being provided for. The twin initiatives of the enactment of this legislation and the reform of the judicial procedures, about which I will speak shortly, should achieve significant time and cost savings in delivering major transport projects under Transport 21.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>That An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decisions are subject to judicial review is as it should be in any democracy. The judicial review of planning decisions is already based on narrow grounds. Such proceedings cannot advance unless substantial grounds have been demonstrated. No appeal can be made from the High Court to the Supreme Court unless the High Court certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable, in the public interest, that an appeal should be allowed. The time taken by the courts to issue their decisions on judicial reviews has caused frustration for our State agencies as they seek to deliver major transport infrastructure projects. In an effort to tackle this issue, the President of the High Court will introduce new arrangements to improve procedures for such cases, including the designation of specific judges to manage the process. This will build on the precedent set in the commercial court and should have a similar impact on improving case management.</P>
    <P>This legislation is necessary to ensure the continued economic development of our country in a sustainable manner. The gaps in Ireland&rsquo;s critical infrastructure pose a real threat to its growth, its environment and the standard of living that its people have quite rightly come to expect. We <Col N="722"/>need 21st century infrastructure now that we are in the 21st century. The Government plans to invest over &euro;43 billion in this country&rsquo;s infrastructure over the next five years. It has committed itself to such expenditure in programmes it has already launched. It is vital that investors and consumers are aware of the timeframe within which projects will be planned and delivered. Every well-publicised delay and risk of delay causes increases in costs for private investors and, ultimately, for taxpayers.</P>
    <P>At present, it is normal for major applications for infrastructural projects to be subject to an appeal, even after lengthy consideration at local level. One of the key changes being made to the existing planning regime is that projects will not have to be approved by local authorities in the first instance. Dialogue between developers and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be facilitated. The board will first be asked to decide whether a project qualifies for the new strategic consent process. Such developments must be of strategic economic or social importance to the State or the region in which it is planned that they will be located. They must contribute significantly to the fulfilment of the objectives of the national spatial strategy or the regional planning guidelines, and they must have a significant effect on the area of more than one planning authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill protects the right of everyone to participate in the planning process. Under the strategic consent process, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be required to consult the relevant local authorities and have due regard to their comments and those of the elected members of the authorities. There is no point in changing the planning system without amending the judicial process. One of the major challenges faced by major infrastructure projects in the past has been the time delays associated with judicial review challenges. An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decisions are subject to judicial review, as they should be in any democracy. It is hoped that, by getting rid of the local authority planning stage and ensuring that a specialised, properly resourced and experienced division within An Bord Plean&aacute;la handles applications for strategic projects, the length of time it takes to get development consent, or planning permission, will be reduced. This will not interfere in any way with the obligation to produce an environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>The types of projects stipulated in the legislation include incinerators, landfills, gas terminals, hazardous waste facilities, gas and oil pipelines, large pylon projects, power stations, oil refineries, wind farms, air terminals, sea ports and sewerage plants. It is clear that this legislation will have far-reaching consequences. Contrary to what members of the Green Party would have one believe, public interest groups will be facilitated by being allowed to challenge decisions, even if no direct interest can be shown. This legislation provides for a ten-week period within which local authorities and, more important, local <Col N="723"/>councillors can prepare their views on a proposed development. As it stands, local councillors normally have no direct role in taking decisions on planning applications, other than in setting the policies for their areas in development plans. This Bill will give them a new and specific role, as managers will be required to obtain and forward the views of the elected members of local authorities to the board. I suggest that this is a welcome change from the perspective of local democracy.</P>
    <P>This legislation allows An Bord Plean&aacute;la to consider additional information, including revised environmental impact statements. An innovative feature of the Bill is that it gives the board the power to hold meetings with relevant stakeholders if it appears to the board that such meetings are necessary. This increase in the board&rsquo;s flexibility in handling disputes should make it possible to achieve better outcomes for everyone.</P>
    <P>The board may also choose to grant permission for a project. For example, it is hoped that projects which are unacceptable because of their location or environmental impact will be identified at the informal preplanning stage. If a promoter wishes to pursue a case to the decision stage, the board will be obliged to deal with it. Matters raised during the board&rsquo;s consideration of the final proposal, as well as submissions made on the proposal, will be considered as part of the decision-making process. Before making its decision, the board must also have regard to a wide range of issues, including submissions and objections made by local people and the local authority, as well as the local development plan, the national spatial strategy and the national interest. The board will be able to balance local and national concerns and to make the correct decision for the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill will facilitate a more streamlined approach to decision making in respect of strategic infrastructure. It will provide a better service for all stakeholders, namely, infrastructure providers, State bodies and the public alike. This legislation will deliver the correct balance between individual rights and the broader public and national interest. I commend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, on introducing this legislation to the House.</P>
    <P>In the main, the Planning and Development Act will be amended to facilitate the introduction of a strategic consent process for strategic infrastructure of national importance to be provided by other statutory bodies and private promoters. An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be restructured to allow for the establishment of a strategic infrastructure division to handle all major infrastructural projects. The types of infrastructure which can be processed by the new division include major environmental, transport and energy related projects. The decision whether a certain project is to <Col N="724"/>be taken under the strategic consent process is a matter in each case for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
    <P>The strategic consent process is a key feature which includes the introduction of a one-step strategic consent procedure for certain types of major infrastructure. Moreover, responsibility for deciding on approvals for railway orders, including light rail and metros will be transferred from the Minister for Transport to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The new division will also handle decisions on all major infrastructure projects which are already the responsibility of the board, including major local authority projects and motorways. It will also handle strategic gas infrastructure consents and major electricity transmission lines.</P>
    <P>I compliment the manager, chief planning officer and director of services at Longford County Council on the responsible manner in which they have handled the development and planning of the county until the present.</P>
    <P>As for planning, people are entitled to live in a good home. I appeal to Members to look sympathetically on planning applications for once-off houses from those who wish to settle down and live with their families. People should be Members&rsquo; main priority and one should leave one&rsquo;s home in the morning in good form. Members have a duty and an obligation to provide housing for people. People who are prepared to provide it for themselves should be encouraged in every way.</P>
    <P>As for the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill, there are times when the minority may be obliged to make some sacrifices. It should do so in the interests of the majority. In a democracy, the majority should receive full consideration. I commend the Bill to the House and I again commend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, as well as the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who is present in the Chamber.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Gormley. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006. It is an important debate and I have listened to the views of Members from differing parties. This debate on planning and development is relevant given the present economic climate and boom. However, Members must acknowledge the debate&rsquo;s downside by facing up to the reality of what went on in this State in the areas of planning and development for the past 20 years. I refer to sleaze and corruption in politics in respect of politicians and planning and development issues. Members must face this reality.</P>
    <P>Moreover, Members must accept the extent to which this issue has seriously damaged politics in general. It has led to much cynicism in public life and has led to the failure of citizens of good quality to turn out to vote at elections. This matter <Col N="725"/>should be dealt with in the course of this debate. I raise this issue because it is important to have the confidence and trust of citizens. In that context, honest planning and quality development are required.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to state that those who are in a minority should be overruled and all voices should be listened to and respected. As democrats, Members accept the views of the majority. However, it is very important for citizens to have confidence and trust in the entire planning process and in issues regarding development. The sensible position regarding planning and development in any part of the city or country is that one requires both quality planning and the correct balance. However, in some respects, the sense of balance has been lost as far as planning and development projects are concerned.</P>
    <P>Law enforcement is another relevant issue. Members receive many complaints from residents&rsquo; groups and individual citizens who state that the law is not being enforced properly. At present, much wildcat planning is taking place across the north side of Dublin. People are being overruled and citizen&rsquo;s voices are neither being heard nor listened to. The issue of enforcement is crucial to this subject.</P>
    <P>The question of housing, to which other Members have already referred, also arises in this context. It is good that so many are doing well as a result of the economic boom, and some people now have two or three houses. My reaction is to wish them well. However, 50,000 or 60,000 people remain on the social and affordable housing waiting list. This reality must be accepted. Some people have two or three houses, while 50,000 or 60,000 others do not have a home. As a society, we must ask ourselves a fundamental question about our present direction.</P>
    <P>Moreover, why was it possible to build such houses in poorer times such as the 1930s and 1940s? I refer to the Government&rsquo;s predecessor. It was able to build more social housing in the 1930s and 1940s than does the present Government in 2006. This issue must also be faced.</P>
    <P>As for the proposed legislation, the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for the introduction of a streamlined planning consent procedure for strategic infrastructure developments, which will be determined by a new strategic infrastructure division to be established within An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and to make the consequential and other changes to the 2000 Act. The Bill also provides for a specialised planning consent procedure for major electricity transmission lines. It amends the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 to provide that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will approve railway orders and amends the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919 to provide for the compensation that will be assessed for the substratum of lands. This constitutes the bones of the legislation and it is <Col N="726"/>important for Members to deal with its substantive part.</P>
    <P>I refer to section 3, which pertains to permissions for strategic infrastructure developments. The sections set out the procedures for the initial consultations with the board, for making an application, the persons who must be notified of the application, including the planning authority or authorities for the relevant area, and the procedures and considerations to be applied by the board when determining the application. Section 3 is also very relevant. It is important the planning is done correctly for the development of major infrastructure projects. I appeal to those involved in planning and the Ministers for Transport, and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to listen to sensible people who make proposals.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue before the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel in my constituency, which has now cost up to &euro;1 billion and is nearly &euro;250 million over budget. I was on the city council at the time and along with local residents we met the construction team. People were advised that under no circumstances would there be damage to their homes and that everything would be hunky dory. In the past week the number of damaged homes in my constituency has reached 254. We have seen structural damage, cracks in walls, and gardens subsiding because of the Dublin Port tunnel. In addition negotiation is ongoing with a further 115 families. The so-called experts told us nothing would happen. We even brought in an expert from London, Dr. de <?oasys _ch ?>Freitas, who told us that everything really would be grand and that we were all imagining these things.</P>
    <P>When we made the proposals we were dismissed as cranks and people jumping on the bandwagon. However, the residents of Marino, Fairview, Santry and Drumcondra have been proved correct. I would like the so-called experts to put up their hands and admit they got it wrong. I accept that all these families will be rightly compensated. However, these people have damage in their kitchens and extensions, and have gardens that are subsiding. This was a major infrastructure project with major problems. The project managers did not come clean and tell the truth. They caused considerable grief and hassle. I raise this issue in the context of the trust and confidence of citizens.</P>
    <P>Developers of large apartment blocks treat the local community very badly. Some of them breach the planning requirements and get away with it. A block of apartments in the Cloisters off Grace Park Road in my constituency was built approximately 1.5 m above the accepted guidelines and was built above a major intersection of the route of the Dublin Port tunnel. The residents in the area were very concerned and angry. One Saturday, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, went into the estate and was chased out of it because of the anger of the residents.</P>

	<P>He ran from their embraces.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State can dream on. The residents were angry as they felt the planning system let them down and that there has been insufficient quality planning across the north side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Section 13 amends section 104 of principal Act and provides for an increase in the permanent number of ordinary members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la from seven to nine. I agree with having nine people. Section 14 amends section 106 of principal Act and provides for the increased membership of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be appointed from a range of organisations which are newly grouped into five panels. The Minister is also given the power to prescribe at least two organisations for each panel. It is important to have quality people involved in this area. We also need honest people whom we can trust on these important planning development issues.</P>
    <P>I again emphasise the importance of sensible and quality planning. Another debate is taking place in my constituency about the Dublin Bay project and the attempt to infill 52 acres of the bay, about which many people are concerned. I commend the people involved in the proposal to develop the port at Bremore as a sensible alternative to filling in 52 acres of Dublin Bay. We have enough slots in Dublin Port at the moment. There are some fantastic ideas and plans to develop ports and projects along the east coast, in particular the Bremore proposal. I urge all Deputies to support the development in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 28 amends section 175 of principal Act and enables An Bord Plean&aacute;la to approve development carried out by or on behalf of local authorities which requires environmental impact assessment. The section is being amended to permit the board to seek alterations to the proposed development by a local authority, and where necessary to require consultation on any proposed alteration. The board is also being permitted to attach certain types of condition to the proposed development and to require the payment of its costs. This section again deals with the issues of local authorities. I appeal to local authorities not to have the macho attitude that we see in some cases. They should listen to what is being said by the councillors in their local authorities and the concerns raised. We all want to move forward and want quality planning and development. Above all we also want balance in planning.</P>
    <P>Section 30 amends section 218 of principal Act to provide that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has absolute discretion as to whether to hold an oral hearing relating to compulsory acquisition of land. Oral hearings are very important. It is important to hear the voices of citizens at first hand.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill and I hope the Minister and others involved directly in the planning process will listen to some of the ideas proposed.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="728"/>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation has been introduced because the perception exists that many major planning proposals have been unnecessarily delayed. The Bill is designed to fast track planning proposals. It follows previous legislation from this Government to essentially dismantle people-centred planning. We have had the introduction of fees for those who want to make planning submissions. I know of many residents who make very sensible submissions on planning issues, who are now being charged for doing so. It seems they are being charged illegally as the European Commission takes a different view and has asked the Government not to charge those fees for a submission.</P>
    <P>A planning proposal with which I am dealing requires &euro;250 to make an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Of course that appeal can only be made by a party that had objected in the first place, which represents a further erosion of people&rsquo;s democratic rights. The Government has a poor record on planning. It seems it wants to move the planning process away from people&rsquo;s participation.</P>
    <P>Some elements in the Government want to remove themselves from Government decision making in this area. I refer to my constituency colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who recently circulated a leaflet in the constituency claiming he is opposed to the incinerator for the Poolbeg Peninsula. This is extraordinary as the incinerator is Government policy. Just before Christmas the Government, consisting of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, approved a public private partnership for the development of the incinerator on the Poolbeg Peninsula. I do not know how he can on the one hand say he is part of the Government and approves of the policy, while on the other hand say he disagrees with the policy. He seems to want to have it both ways. While I am not saying that people in this Chamber are doing that, I am saying that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is doing just that. It is quite unprecedented for a Minister to behave in this fashion.</P>
    <P>His basic argument is that this is now a mass burn incinerator: of course it is a mass burn incinerator that is proposed for the Poolbeg Peninsula. The Progressive Democrats manifesto for the 2002 general election states the party &ldquo;would ensure no mass burn incineration&rdquo;, yet a public private partnership is proposed to provide such an incinerator. How can the party approve of such a public private partnership while opposing the development? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claims in a leaflet he circulated in the constituency that he &ldquo;successfully thwarted the proposal to have the project taken away from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and handed over to a fast-track infrastructural board&rdquo;. That is a reference to this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister could have achieved this. He says he has used his ministerial <Col N="729"/>office to influence his Cabinet colleagues but despite tabling numerous parliamentary questions, I have not been provided with details of his representations on this. I do not know how he did it. If Dublin City Council wishes, it can wait until we pass the legislation to process the planning application for the incinerator. Nothing can prevent the council from doing this but there is little difference between undertaking a public private partnership, which must be referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and the process provided for in the legislation, which provides for the making of applications directly to the board. There is no profound difference and, therefore, the Minister&rsquo;s claim is bogus.</P>
    <P>When people accuse others of making a political football out of an issues such as this, they need to be careful as they are standing in a glasshouse. Clearly, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made the incinerator project a major issue. He said this would be a major plank of his election campaign and that he would put manners on Fianna F&aacute;il in Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Somebody should put manners on him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy McDowell, has capitulated completely to Fianna F&aacute;il and its policy of building incinerators all over the country and, in particular, in our constituency, where it is proposed to build Europe&rsquo;s largest incinerator, which is expected to process 600,000 tonnes or more of waste annually. The desire to fast-track the legislation bodes poorly for the future because monitoring of its implementation is not ensured. The largest sewage treatment plant in Europe, which was supported by local residents, is located in my constituency but the developers made a mess of it. The odours in the area are appalling. While the legislation provides for fast-tracking of projects, it does not provide for transparency and accountability.</P>
    <P>When planning applications are heard by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, one can have all the good reasons one likes for opposing a development but if it is Government policy, the objections will be forgotten. During the appeal on the Ringaskiddy toxic incinerator, the inspector gave 14 reasons it should not proceed but the board overruled him. That is neither good planning nor democratic. It smacks of a dictatorship where one railroads one&rsquo;s proposals through and that is the basis for the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about Schedule 7, which refers to &ldquo;a thermal power station or other combustion installation with a total energy output of 300 MW or more&rdquo;. I would like the Government to amend this provision by inserting the words &ldquo;excluding nuclear power&rdquo;. Legislation, which was amended on foot of a Green Party proposal, is in place to prevent the construction of a nuclear power station but I am not convinced by recent statements by the Minister for the Environment, Heri<Col N="730"/>tage and Local Government. The Minister, the Taoiseach and others have been completely over the top in their statements about nuclear power recently. &ldquo;Methinks they doth protest too much&rdquo; because they have said such power is horrific. If they believe that, they should accept my proposed amendment. The last thing we need is the fast-tracking of a nuclear power station.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is fond of expressing his opinion on a regular basis, whether we agree with him. I have my point of view which I am not afraid to express. One is not put in a strait-jacket when one joins a political party as one can express one&rsquo;s point of view.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should express his.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>Thereafter one follows the Whip, which the Deputy also does. He will do so when his party decides whether it will go into government following the next election. The Deputy is hedging his bets and other members of his party have differing opinions about coalition.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time I have followed Deputy Finian McGrath in a debate during which he has focused on corruption and social housing. Fianna F&aacute;il Governments have built a significant number of social housing schemes since the late 1940s. The previous Government introduced many Bills that have made politicians so transparent that we rightly stand out from everybody else. However, not every public representative should be painted with the corruption brush. The vast majority of Members and councillors are decent and honourable men and women who have not encountered corruption or a brown envelope and they should be spoken of highly because they make a positive and significant contribution to public life.</P>
    <P>We have experienced significant economic growth and prosperity over the past ten years. I come from a business background and I never believed growth would accelerate at the pace it has, given that in the 1980s I was paying interest at 22%. However, we are now at full employment. The delivery of infrastructure is being challenged by new dynamics within the economy. Greater demands than ever are being made to provide for the increasing number of people in the State who are developing businesses and getting on with their lives. That presents new chal<Col N="731"/>lenges and this legislation provides for a proper planning and development system on which we can rely. While I have confidence in the current planning system, it is archaic and is creaking under the pressure of development and developers. Sometimes it delivers decisions and, no matter what, they are referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. As a result, much needed projects are delayed by between six and nine months. That is a significant issue when trying to deliver infrastructure on time. We must keep up to speed in delivering what is necessary for the citizens we represent.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy is often criticised, but I support it. It makes sense, but we need to see some tangible benefits. The delivery of infrastructure in the regions would be an example of such benefits. Communities are under pressure as people must combine work with a quality of life. They suffer the stresses and strains of trying to pay mortgages, child minders, going to work and making time for their families. The infrastructural projects that are needed but are being held up are those that will be dealt with by this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, there are currently issues with the planning process for large projects. We can learn from what happened in previous projects, which sometimes caused cynicism among the public due to poor delivery or no delivery at all. For 30 years, we debated the provision of an inner relief road in my constituency. There was much opposition from local communities because the plans were developed in a poor fashion by the local authorities concerned. There was very poor consultation and the local authority pretty much acknowledged that it was the only stakeholder and that communities should be pleased it was being delivered rather than having access to the process itself. Rather than continuing with the existing planning process and honouring a commitment given to local borough council members that it would be discussed and voted on, the executive decided to opt for an environmental impact study. That is a method of bypassing the process of debate with local public representatives. That decision has left communities frustrated with the current system. That particular project should be examined and lessons should be learned from it. I agree with business leaders and the local communities in Kilkenny that the project is much needed. It should be planned with all of the stakeholders involved, especially the public representatives.</P>
    <P>We could also learn from the project to construct the Piltown-Fiddown bypass, a 9.3 km stretch of road in County Kilkenny and an essential piece of infrastructure. When it was delivered, it caused friction within the local community, which felt it was excluded from the process. It resulted in further funding being delivered to the county last year for a two-plus-one road system to deal with the problems arising from the original project. The original contract cost around &euro;13.5 <Col N="732"/>million, yet it doubled in cost before it was completed. When I raised the issue on behalf of the communities, legal action was threatened in 2001. I presume this is the method of muzzling public representatives and this gives us an idea of how local authorities defend themselves. I was right in the end as it was a poor design and it cost millions of euro extra. It resulted in the deaths of seven people. During that process, a public official acknowledged that people would die on the road. While this was acknowledged in correspondence, no action was taken. That is a deplorable process in our local authorities. The residents in Rathmore Road and Tower Road in Piltown complain about being excluded from the current process and not having their common-sense suggestions taken on board to protect their quality of life, while acknowledging that the decisions taken are normally based on the idea of the lesser evil for the greater good. They are willing to participate, yet they are excluded. The local authority is firmly to blame for this because the process is in its hands. The authority should allow the other stakeholders to participate, such as the NRA and the local community.</P>
    <P>It is time for an independent investigation into what happened in the delivery of that project and what is happening to the project that is currently being funded for that road. An intervention by the Minister would represent good practice and would restore public confidence in the planning system in Kilkenny. Too many accidents and fatalities have occurred on that road, yet public representatives are asked to stand aside. I attempted to raise such an issue in this House in the past two weeks, but I was not allowed to do so. Such a decision is indicative of the distance that is being put between public representatives in this Parliament and the citizens we represent. It is not good enough for any Government to stand over that type of record. The Minister should intervene to find out what will happen to this project, because I have no doubt it will arise in the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement on the inclusion of public representatives and their views in the group to examine projects under this Bill. For far too long, councillors have been left outside the loop. In some cases, they have been asked to pay for the reports that have been made available to local public representatives. That shows why the decision to end the dual mandate was nonsense. There are times when we get it wrong in this House and in that legislation, we created a disconnection between central government, local government and the people we represent. There is a unique contact between Members of this Parliament and citizens that has been maintained since the foundation of the State. The decision to end the dual mandate ended that unique approach. It cut off a knowledge base that was available to Members heretofore and that worked. If it worked, we should not <Col N="733"/>have intervened. We will continue to pay for that deficit of knowledge in the future.</P>
    <P>In cases like this, legislation should be reviewed and public representatives from this House should be included in the planning process. While I welcome the opening of that door to local public representatives, an amendment should be tabled to the Bill to allow Members of this House to put their views on large-scale projects before county managers for inclusion in any report. That would be of benefit to the system and to this Bill. Communities have gained from the integrated area plans currently coming to fruition, such as the railway station site in Kilkenny. Community gain is often paid lip-service but that scheme has to be signed off in the context of tax exemptions. We need to protect community gains through legislation so there will be tangible results for the communities affected by projects. The local authority waste management schemes, in which funds created from dumped waste go to various local projects, are effective in that respect. We should support the notion of community gain.</P>
    <P>A pre-planning consultation process is essential. During the course of the current planning process, clients are offered opportunities to discuss pre-planning issues arising from their applications. Pre-planning consultations will streamline the system, ensure projects qualify and address issues which subsequently arise.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill deals with rogue developers but it is a pity we cannot address this issue through the normal planning process. It has been suggested that planning permission could be withheld from rogue developers who have a history of non-compliance. That should be the case with regard to unfinished housing estates, which the Minister referred to in his introduction to the Bill, because too many developers have obtained planning permission despite previously leaving local communities to deal with unfinished estates. Although the enforcement sections of local authorities are now being given more resources, it remains difficult for them to track rogue developers through the legal system. Developers who take advantage of legal loopholes and delays do nothing but add to the frustration and anger of the citizens who must live in these estates. It would be a good idea to refuse planning permission to rogue developers until their other developments are completed but if this measure is to be provided for in the Bill, I would like the resources made available to enforce it. It is essential that adequate resources and personnel are part and parcel of any legislation passing through this House so proper enforcement can be ensured. An imbalance has existed for many years whereby local authorities, and now the new planning board, do not have the resources to deal with rogue developers.</P>
    <P>The demands put on An Bord Plean&aacute;la by large numbers of planning applications suggest the need to re-examine its functions. Too often, <Col N="734"/>field officers make a recommendation only to be overturned by board members, a situation which has been criticised by the general public and elected representatives. The board will need an extra degree of independence in order that its decisions are transparent and stand up to scrutiny. It is not acceptable that applicants have to wait six months or longer for a decision, particularly where the delay arises from difficulties in finding personnel who are capable of dealing with projects coming before the board. We have to ensure that any new special section is adequately resourced and contains the range of skills necessary to address these important issues.</P>
    <P>I conclude by again calling for an independent inquiry into the issues arising from the Piltown-Fiddown bypass.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. The Fine Gael Party supports the Bill in principle, although we intend to table a number of amendments. A number of Deputies described the Bill as a means of fast-tracking or rushing the planning process. I hope that will not be the case because planning should not be rushed but should be measured, considered and subjected to as much public scrutiny and participation as possible. This Bill should try to bring clarity and certainty to the planning process and allow promoters, developers and investors, whether public or private, to estimate how long it will take to bring a project from conception to construction. That is a reasonable expectation for anybody who invests a lot of money in a project.</P>
    <P>Some sort of closure is needed in the planning process because, in the past, the timescales for many projects have been open-ended. For that reason, I support the Bill. Past projects have gone through endless appeals processes, only to end up in long-running court cases and, often, in Europe. Political failures are largely to blame for this problem, in that processes are not pushed to their limits for political reasons or because politicians hope objections will die away if they ignore an issue. However, trust in the system is further eroded when issues are ignored. Deputy McGrath remarked on the need to restore confidence and trust in the planning process and, while I do not often agree with the Deputy, I do in this instance. Trust will only be restored by bringing transparency to the process.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The Bill&rsquo;s provision for a planning consent procedure represents a reasonable approach to the matter. However, as my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, has mentioned, safeguards are essential. By trying to create an absolute timeframe, the Bill could be accused of riding roughshod over the legitimate interests of local objectors, be they residents or businesses. The board must have regard for the national interest when it considers planning applications. A proper balance must be found because <Col N="735"/>the danger might otherwise arise that the board will unreasonably override local interests.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, once a project is accepted into this special process, which by definition classifies it as an important piece of strategic infrastructure, it automatically increases its odds of getting planning permission. It will almost inevitably succeed. The key is who makes the decision to designate a project as strategic. The Bill provides that An Bord Plean&aacute;la makes that decision. It is fine to decide that a project is strategic. However, a strategic project is not necessarily good, worthwhile or in the national interest. That is where we may encounter difficulties. There have been energy projects that were seen as national strategic infrastructure and would have been wonderful projects if they worked, but they had little chance of working. The danger is that by lifting them into a higher area of planning they may slip through the vetting process.</P>
    <P>A pre-planning vetting process is needed to ensure projects are subject to a cost-benefit analysis to see if they are in the national interest. Big State projects such as the metro and the interconnector, which could go through this process, would be subject to a cost-benefit analysis and alternatives would hopefully be examined before one is selected. I do not know if the Minister can clarify this. Suppose a private developer wants to build a second or third airport in Dublin. Although that would be strategic infrastructure, would it be in the national interest? Who would decide? These are the pitfalls.</P>
    <P>In shortening the process to one step there is a greater need for transparency and the dissemination of information to people who will be affected by the project. Under the current planning system, despite little notices being put up at sites, people too often miss the planning process. When there has been much discussion and media coverage of a project it seems impossible to miss, yet somehow the people most affected by it never hear about it. Putting notices on the site and in the paper is not enough for an extension to a semi-detached house or for major projects. I am thinking of a major project in my constituency, the extension of the Luas. Although the public inquiry has taken place and the inspector has made his report to the Minister, I still receive letters from people asking if they can change the route. They have missed that this important process has taken place and they have not been party to it. There is a serious need to get information to the public. People think this has been rushed through and they were not told, and they are right to a certain extent. There must be a new way to inform the people directly affected about what is planned for their area so they can have their say. Before public hearings are planned, local individuals should be notified of the process, whether by advertising or leaflet drops.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the notion of pre-planning discussion, transparency is needed in another <Col N="736"/>area. Pre-planning discussions are already taking place at local authority level. Once pre-planning begins and people begin measuring sites with theodolites and tape measures, local rumours immediately begin. People know something is afoot but cannot find out what. Immediately the distrust and lack of confidence surfaces and this brings the planning process into disrepute. While I understand the need for commercial confidentiality, local authorities treat pre-planning like the three secrets of Fatima. The public is entitled to know, in broad terms, that there is something coming down the track because the opportunities for the public to make their representations are tight. Under this new planning consent process the public has six weeks whether it is a house extension or a major project. To object to a technically complex project such as an incinerator or a baling station, people are entitled to more time. It would not dramatically change the overall timescale of a project. Under the legislation councillors are given ten weeks to examine such projects and members of the public, who are probably more significantly affected, should have at least the same amount of time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that for the first time the local authority members will have a statutory role in the planning process. I am not sure if the councillors will think so because it will be onerous for them. These will be major projects of strategic importance which will often have a deleterious impact on local residents. Councillors will have to make an objective decision having due regard to the local and national interest. All councillors and public representatives should welcome this.</P>
    <P>I note that there is an opportunity for local authorities to recover the costs associated with major planning applications such as this. Given that the application is dealt with by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I wonder what costs it would have. I assume, and perhaps the Minister can clarify this, it is to pay for the great need for independent, objective, expert and out-of-house advice to adjudicate on what will be complex and technical projects. If that is the purpose of allowing local authorities to recover their costs, it is a good measure and will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the principle of community gain, I want to issue a caution. It is already used by the private sector in planning applications. Sometimes a real community gain is provided and it works. Sometimes it works in favour of a portion of the community and is divisive because half the community sees the other half as being bought off by developers. We need to clarify in the legislation what we mean by community gain and guarantee it is a genuine, overall gain that benefits the entire area and not just a handful of objectors.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult for a public representative not to be interested in this Bill. One of my main interests is its impact on public transport, which is essential. Ireland has been described as a First World economy with a Third World infrastruc<Col N="737"/>ture. The growing economy is creaking from the lack of infrastructure necessary to keep pace with its demands and the deficit to facilitate future growth. Every year the demand for transport of goods and people grows faster than the ability to meet that demand, resulting in a large and growing deficit. The Exchequer figures for the last four years highlight the fact the Government has failed to meet the modest target of 5% of GDP to be spent on infrastructure projects.</P>
    <P>Many commentators have highlighted the inadequacy of this objective. It is not enough to ensure the economy can continue to grow and make up for the failures of the past. We must find ways to ensure that what we plan can be done within a reasonable time. Citizens of Dublin are fed up with hearing promises of projects while sitting in endless traffic jams, watching full buses go past them and travelling in trains in conditions in which one would not transport animals. Despite the money spent, facilities for commuters have changed very little. We have not spent enough despite spending much money, and what has been spent has not given us value.</P>
    <P>The reason for this is the massive cost overruns on major infrastructure projects such as the Luas lines. The delays and overruns in this project were caused by indecision at the planning stage. Another example is the port tunnel, which is two years overdue while the cost has doubled. If projects are not started within a reasonable timeframe, they are underdesigned by the time they commence. After the contract has been awarded and a price agreed, the project must be redesigned. The developer or builder has the client over a barrel in respect of the extra amount that will be charged. I suspect this is what happened with the port tunnel. When developers and builders see so many projects delayed, they factor in these delays in the initial tender price. This is a guarantee of inflation and cost overruns. The planning process is a major factor in cost overruns and time delays. If this Bill brings some certainty to the planning process and ensures faster delivery of strategic infrastructure, it is a positive measure.</P>
    <P>Every public representative seeks a more streamlined planning system. I hope the new system in An Bord Plean&aacute;la will distinguish between promoters in a hurry to receive planning permission and the higher remit of projects in the national interest. As we embark on a major investment in rail and metro I hope this Bill will allow planning to proceed and ensure the projects are delivered on time and within budget.</P>
    <P>Post-permission changes are very costly and are not addressed in this Bill. After planning permission has been granted, it sometimes becomes clear that changes must be made due to site conditions or a design problem. Sometimes this is a minor change and, when a project has planning permission in principle, there should be a short circuit method of making minor changes to planning permission. One example is a building in my <Col N="738"/>constituency that has not been completed. The developer wished to change a portion of the building because the client wanted to change the use of the building. The building has remained half-built for the past two years and this is in nobody&rsquo;s interest because it looks terrible and the builders must work elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Public information and communication is crucial. Small planning site notices are hopelessly inadequate as a method of informing the public. There is an increasing tendency for post-permission agreements between councils and developers. Sometimes these are signalled in the planning application and concluded afterwards but sometimes they are used to bypass the planning system. In two cases in my constituency, side deals were done between developers and the council.</P>
    <P>Councils can now take the building history of a developer, and whether they have failed to complete sites, into account. This should have been brought into law far sooner but it is apposite now because of the number of apartment blocks being built. In the past, councils could urge builders to complete development but now there is no protection for apartment block owners whose sites will never be taken in charge. In many cases they must pay for completion of the complex through management charges even though it was a condition of the planning permission that the developer undertake this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it achieves its aims. If not, we can revert to it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>This presents an opportunity to speak on the general point of how the population has grown in recent times. Inevitably, in a strong economy, the need for facilities increases considerably. Until now, it has not been possible for infrastructure such as motorways, roads and power facilities to keep up with the requirements of the general public. People feel the Government or local authorities are not meeting the requirements of an expanding and more prosperous population. Part of the reason for this is the difficulties in the planning process which are addressed by this Bill. Other issues must also be addressed to speed up the delivery of essential public services.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with rogue developers, who have been the bane of every elected representative&rsquo;s life. There have been difficulties with builders moving onto estates and not completing them. People living there complain that work has not been completed. Inevitably, land is sold off in subplots to second or third developers, who regularly display weaker commitment to the planning conditions attached to the original developer. Roads, paths and other infrastructure, including green areas, are not completed, particularly in housing estates.</P>
    <P>It is different with commercial development, since if a premises is sold for commercial purposes and people must continue to conduct busi<Col N="739"/>ness through a shop, office or factory to earn a livelihood, it will have to be completed to a high standard. By definition, they will have to attract new customers to their place of business daily. It is essential for commercial reasons that all such developments in those areas be completed properly.</P>
    <P>That is not the case with housing or apartment developments. We have all seen that people pay deposits and buy houses from the plans before ever a sod is turned. They make staged payments and are in their houses while the development is still effectively a building site. They have no control whatsoever over how projects are completed.</P>
    <P>There were provisions in previous legislation regarding rogue developers to ensure they completed sites. An important one was that their previous track record could be used against them in a planning application. Section 9 tightens that procedure and places the onus of proof on the developer or applicant rather than the local authority, an excellent way of dealing with it. Under the new system, if the planning authority feels there is good reason to exercise its power to refuse permission, it can serve notice in writing to the applicant to that effect. It will give reasons and specify previous failures to comply, inviting the applicant to make a submission to the authority to give his or her side of the story. The onus is now rightly on the applicant in all planning applications to provide all necessary information. They must prove to the local authority&rsquo;s satisfaction why they should not have permission refused based on their previous track record. The onus of proof is now on developers.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It goes without saying that it can be a severe imposition on some developers. It can be difficult where previous sites have changed hands, and there can be legal complications. Naturally, the legislation provides for a period during which a person can apply to the High Court to have that provision satisfied. I have given examples where there might be bona fide reasons. There may be other grounds not taken into account for the planning authority to consider. A court can direct a local authority to satisfy that provision and consider the new application on its merits. It is correct that there be a right to a court appeal in such a situation.</P>
    <P>However, I do not expect that many applicants would take that route, since it is in their interest to deal with the local planning authority rather than spend time in the High Court. If they do not answer to the council&rsquo;s satisfaction and give adequate reasons for not completing previous developments, the council can refuse planning permission.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with section 6(<i>c</i>), which states that no appeal may be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la if a planning authority refuses planning permission under that section. Once developers have gone through the process without going to court, they cannot appeal the local <Col N="740"/>authority&rsquo;s decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. This gives them tremendous power that residents&rsquo; associations around the country have been demanding for years. There have been improvements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is long overdue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is long overdue.</P>
    <P Just="Left">There was previously provision but too much responsibility on the local authority. The onus now falls on the planning applicant to prove his or her bona fides, as is only right. That is good news buried in this important legislation. It is a special section not directly connected with the legislation&rsquo;s main business, but I wish to highlight it from that perspective. It is very important, and most people will be very pleased to hear of it.</P>
    <P>The Bill&rsquo;s objectives include the following. Projects promoted by local authorities in their own areas will go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the basis the local authority, as a planning authority, should not be judge and jury in its own case. Large infrastructure projects such as motorways require an environmental impact assessment. Everyone would agree with that, and it brings me to a very important point.</P>
    <P>We will very soon have to move to a system whereby all local authority developments go to a special section of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. There is no basis in natural justice for a housing section in a local authority to grant planning permission to its own planning section when the same directors of services sit around the table with each other every day of the week, and there is only one county manager. What is wrong with that system is that the public has no right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
    <P>People say day in, day out that the council has one rule for itself and one for others. We have all seen instances where planning permission has been refused for certain reasons. I have witnessed several cases of refusal because facilities might not be in place in a private development. However, if it is promoted by the county council, its own staff will pressure the planning department to say the development is needed for sewerage or social housing. If an application had come from an outside third party, it would not have been entertained; yet they regularly get through the system because the local authority is both promoting and adjudicating on them.</P>
    <P>I know elected members also have a role in such matters, but it is very hard for them to stand up all of a sudden and oppose a development because infrastructure such as water and sewerage is not in place. They tend to give it the nod, and that creates problems for residents later. I would like a situation whereby no Government body or local authority making a planning application judges itself. That will have to be addressed at some point.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, development projects outside the normal planning system have a separate con<Col N="741"/>sent system, for example, railway lines, which would previously have been subject to consent procedures. Major infrastructure projects carried out by the private sector, a State-sponsored body or local authorities outside their area had to go through the normal, two-step planning process, but now they will go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Those arrangements are sensible, and people will be happy with them.</P>
    <P>I wish briefly to highlight the details covered by the Bill. I will mention only the headings, since there might be some confusion among the public. Section 5 lists the types of projects that will now go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which include energy infrastructure projects such as oil refineries, terminals and power stations, and industrial installations whose output is more than 300 MW. Transport projects covered would include railway stations and lines.</P>
    <P>Applications regarding the environment, the area about which the public is most concerned, such as waste disposal incinerators would go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. I stress it will be only for facilities whose annual intake is greater than 100,000 tonnes. That is a very substantial incinerator and not the kind that would be proposed in local areas.</P>
    <P>I think in particular of my own midland region, which has a waste management plan. There is provision for thermal treatment in all the regional plans, but I have always stated there is not the physical supply of waste in the midland counties of Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath and north Tipperary to justify it, something confirmed in the legislation, which will apply only to facilities with an intake greater than 100,000 tonnes per annum.</P>
    <P>There will be a few such incinerators around the country, but not in every county. Some claim the Bill will force them onto localities without public consultation, but they should consider the facts and the content of the legislation. There will inevitably be a few, but they will not pop up everywhere. It is important that those ready to join the scaremongering bandwagon examine the facts. We are talking only about extremely large incinerators. We will have the normal public consultation procedures in these matters, and it is welcome that they are continued in this legislation. There will be a strategic infrastructure division in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
    <P Just="Left">For the first time, there will be a formal legislative role for elected councillors. Up to now councillors could object to a particular aspect of a project and, while their objection was noted, they had no formal role. Now, within ten weeks from receipt of the application, the local authority can submit to the board a report setting out its views. The county manager will be required by law to submit the report to the members of the authority seeking their views on the proposed development, and the members of the planning authority may, by resolution, decide to attach recommendations specified in the resolution to the report of the authority where the members so <Col N="742"/>decide these recommendations will be attached to the report submitted to the board.</P>
    <P>This is an important new provision. It does not provide for a formal decision but there is now a mechanism by which elected members can have a formal legal impact on, and involvement in, the process. The views of the elected members of a local authority will now be formally taken into account by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which did not happen heretofore. It is a little like the county development plan in that the manager&rsquo;s report must go before the elected members who can, by resolution, agree to it or make amendments to it.</P>
    <P>Most of this legislation relates to projects which require environmental impact statements, EISs. The way we deal with EISs is a major issue. Despite my limited experience, I have severe criticisms to make of the quality of EISs submitted to local authorities. Many people submit minimum information in the hope it will satisfy the local planner. I have yet to meet a planner in my local authority who has been satisfied with an EIS. Planners must regularly write to applicants stating the EIS was insufficient and inadequate for reasons which they must specify. For example, the EIS might not deal with the human and environmental aspects or with every protected structure. I have yet to see a satisfactory EIS produced by the private sector.</P>
    <P>The reason for some of the delays with major infrastructure is that we do not have the quality of people in the private sector to design some of the major projects properly. As I have seen with projects in the midlands, owing to the growing economy and the fact that everybody is stretched, we are bringing in consultants from the UK and much further afield to work on projects. It takes a great deal of time for these people to familiarise themselves with the situation in this country. Time and again, planners are very dissatisfied with the quality of EISs. That is a significant contributory factor to the delay in the planning process. The law or the planners are not the problem.</P>
    <P>Perhaps planners should reject applications if they receive bad or poorly drafted EISs. If the application is bad, it is not the job of the local authority to coach the applicant how to get it right. The legislation provides for pre-planning discussions with the decision makers in An Bord Plean&aacute;la who can direct the applicants on the areas to be covered by an EIS. However, if one thinks about it, the people preparing an EIS should have the professional competence to do so and they should not have to go to the decision makers to ask what is required. If they know their job, they should know what is required. It is a little like a judge directing a solicitor on how he should put forward a client&rsquo;s case.</P>
    <P>I hope the professional bodies involved in the preparation of EISs under the various headings will be quick to learn from each other&rsquo;s reports. Given that these are new infrastructural developments which we have not had in the past, perhaps these people do not have the expertise and <Col N="743"/>it is necessary to bring in expertise from outside the country. However, many of the reports I have seen could have been done better in the first place. I hope An Bord Plean&aacute;la will give advice but will not have to coach applicants excessively on how to present a good application.</P>
    <P>Another issue of emerging concern in regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is where there is a clear divergence between the inspector, who carries out the oral hearing, and the decision of the board. As a public representative, I find such divergences difficult to explain to people. This legislation states that the board can give the inspector directions on what he or she must consider as part of his or her oral hearing. It is at the discretion of the board whether to conduct an oral hearing. Perhaps it would be better if those directions were published in advance of the oral hearing so the public would know the parameters of the hearing, that the inspector&rsquo;s hands were, to a significant extent, tied or that the inspector had been told to examine the issues from the point of view of sustainable development in the area but to remember that the board would look at the broader national policy following his or her work at local level. That should be stated at the outset if the process is to be genuine.</P>
    <P>We have all seen instances in our constituencies, in terms of major infrastructural projects and smaller private sector projects, where an inspector made one decision but the board made another. While the board provides a paragraph stating the reason for its refusal, it does not help the public&rsquo;s perception of An Bord Plean&aacute;la if the people it employs to do a job are overruled at the last minute for no apparent reason. The public finds it hard to accept it if an inspector holds an oral hearing in a local hotel for two to four days, or even three or four weeks in the case of some motorway projects, and his or her report is overruled by people who never left their offices in Dublin. The board might consider how it could be a little more consistent in how it does its work and publishes its decisions. This area needs to be tidied up.</P>
    <P>We should not get too excited about that issue of fees to the board and to local authorities. It is all taxpayers&rsquo; money and it involves taking money from the local authorities to give to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to cover its fees &mdash; taking money from Peter to give to Paul. It is of no great consequence in that it is taxpayers&rsquo; money being expended by the local authorities and what of it if An Bord Plean&aacute;la must carry a cost and is not reimbursed by the local authority. While it might make for tidy book-keeping, it should not be a significant issue. We are only talking about moving a cheque from one State body to another.</P>
    <P>I refer to the inspection of the files. Up to now, if the issue was being dealt with at local authority level, people could go to the local authority office and examine the file. If an application is made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I am concerned <Col N="744"/>that people will have to travel to its office in Dublin. Its public office will have to be made much larger. I ask that the matter be clarified so that there is easy access for the public to the files during the course of consideration of a planning application. I hope the legislation is enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to address the broader issue of the provision of infrastructure and the failure of this Government and the Taoiseach to grasp an opportunity when the new Government was formed in 2002. We are going through a period of economic growth which the economic forecasters suggest will last for another ten to 15 years at in or around 4% to 5%. At one level, it is a fantastic opportunity for this country. It is a prospect previous Administrations did not face and it provides opportunities none of us could have dreamed of 15 years ago. However, the opportunities it presents are not being capitalised upon. The emerging sustainability argument which confronts not only this island but the whole of the European Union, if not the entire globe, seems to be ignored in the lack of joined-up thinking in Government.</P>
    <P>I am firmly of the view that, when this Government was formed, it should have established a Department of infrastructure instead of a Department of Transport. We should have had a Minister with responsibility for infrastructure and a spatial plan for the whole of the country and not the spatial strategy which has been published and subsequently ignored, as we saw in the disastrous decentralisation argument. The national spatial strategy is a woolly document lacking in coherence for developers trying to anticipate where the major infrastructure would go. Instead, we are presented with this compromise Bill which, despite three or four years&rsquo; gestation, does not deal with one of the key problems that arises when a community feels its wishes have been ignored, namely, redress to the courts.</P>
    <P>The courts will not necessarily deal any more quickly with disputes arising from this than they have in the past. This is an area where the delay in the delivery of infrastructure has occurred. It is wrong to suggest this Bill will deal with some of the issues we need to address or speed up the decision-making process. It will trample on local democracy and increase the cynicism and suspicion that already exist at local level.</P>
    <P>A department of infrastructure would prevent the problems that emerge when planning permission is granted for housing estates, for example, in the constituencies of Deputies O&rsquo;Dowd and Burton. The educational authorities are mystified when, four years after the houses have been built, the patter of little feet is heard as children arrive to enrol as junior infants in the local school. There is no coherent linkage between the provision of housing estates, primary schools, secondary schools and local health care <Col N="745"/>facilities to enable a general practitioner to establish him or herself in the area and provide cover.</P>
    <P>That did not matter in the past because we were growing so slowly. As public representatives, we know that the process of moving from the first to the last stages in providing a primary school was a bureaucratic procedure designed to conceal the fact that resources were scarce and to ration out those resources over a period with a veneer of proper management. Now there is a crisis because parents cannot enrol their children in school, yet the procedure for the provision of primary schools has not been radically transformed when it needs to be. We are facing population growth on a scale with which no previous independent Administration ever had to cope.</P>
    <P>We need a department of infrastructure to ensure that we get the joined-up thinking that does not exist in the Department of Health and Children which, for example, provides a facility in Mullingar Hospital that has stood empty for between five and seven years because of a lack of staff. Something is wrong with the way we govern ourselves, politically and administratively, when it produces this type of contradiction. It is not peculiar to one Administration because three Governments were responsible for the examples I have cited.</P>
    <P>We need a department of infrastructure to remove the capital spend in respect of education, health services, housing, transport and energy from the various Departments now responsible for those areas and consider the implications of creating a national plan for the whole island, not just the 26 counties. Deputy Cowley is Acting Chairman, but I will address him in his representative capacity for a moment, and his colleague from Mayo, Deputy Cooper-Flynn. The country needs an infrastructural plan that will link Derry to Killarney and, through that, connect Sligo and Castlebar, Galway and Limerick, and Killarney and Rosslare.</P>
    <P>We need a box grid of infrastructure on this island, not the radial spokes that shove the traffic jams out in the morning from the estates into Dublin city and back in the evening. This is a most inefficient design of infrastructure. It is also one-dimensional. When the ESB contacted the National Roads Authority to ask if it could use the median on roadways to roll out broadband, the NRA said it was in the business of roads, not communications.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not begin to address strategic infrastructure. There is no picture, for example, to show an investor coming here for the first time wanting to know what the country would look like 25 years hence. If one were to join the development plans for each of the local authorities together like a jigsaw, they would not fit because they are not linked up. Producing this legislation before a strategic plan puts the cart before the horse. A proper structural spatial plan also needs to be rigorously stress-tested for <Col N="746"/>increases in the cost of energy, given the present crisis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is in the Chamber. This Bill proposes to enhance the role of local democracy, giving councillors ten weeks in which to respond to a strategic infrastructural project that would qualify under this legislation. The role of city councillors in Dublin has been trampled on by the provisions emanating from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Yesterday, several people in my constituency asked me about the incinerator. Dublin City Council has formally and democratically rejected the incinerator but the city manager is proceeding with it under the instructions of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister may shake his head but that is the reality. The direction for the waste disposal plan for the Dublin region resulted in an incinerator being located on the most populated bay on the entire island. The local people do not want it and local representatives have voted against it, yet it is being imposed upon them by managerial diktat through the process of legislation that was deliberately brought in by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors. We bemoan the fact that many do not bother to vote in local elections but, if they do, the people they elect cannot articulate their concerns or carry through their wishes and interests.</P>
    <P>This incinerator will service the Dublin region. Waste will be baled on sites along the M50, transported through the tunnel and across the toll bridge to Ringsend to be burnt, notwithstanding the under-capacity of the M50 and the difficulty for trucks going through the tunnel. There is no joined-up thinking in this plan.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker, from Laoighis-Offaly, spoke about the lack of incinerators in his constituency. The country needs one major incinerator, or at least two or three, not the plethora of incinerators it is getting. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd will correct me if I am wrong in saying that the successful applicants to build one in County Meath have applied to increase its capacity. They applied originally, however, on the basis of an assessment of the quantity of disposable waste in the waste management plan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>They have, yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>If the waste management plan is successful, we will reduce the flow of fuel to incinerators and, if the fuel is not burnt at a sufficient volume to a sufficient temperature, there is a risk of dioxins entering the system. This was one of the conclusions drawn from the Merck Sharp and Dohme controversy in Tipperary many years ago.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to take at face value the proposition that this Bill will enhance local democracy and give councillors more say than they have at present when those who want to have a say and voted formally to reject an incinerator local <Col N="747"/>people do not want see it going through. There is an extraordinary element of hypocrisy in this matter too because, although the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has solemnly sworn to defend the interests of his constituents in Dublin South-East and prevent the incinerator from going ahead, he has sat, as Attorney General and as a Minister, at the Cabinet table and allowed this happen. If the issue were as important at national level as he proclaimed it was at local level, he would have done the honourable thing, that is, he would have objected to it properly and resigned if unsuccessful. Otherwise he would have told his constituents in Dublin South-East that he was not doing what he had promised and they could therefore make their own decision on his candidacy in the next election. He has chosen neither of these options and consequently public cynicism has increased.</P>
    <P>Without dealing with the High Court process and ensuring that a special division of that court would process disputes speedily, many of the objectives of this legislation will not be achieved. The Bill is tramping on the first layer of local democracy and removing the planning process at this level. At the level of local democracy, a local group concerned about a project can go to its local county council office to see the plans, talk to its own councillors and engage in some interaction regarding the possible local impact of the proposal. The first layer of local democracy is being stripped away not in respect of small domestic extensions but in respect of major infrastructural projects, which will generate far more concerns than normal domestic-type applications.</P>
    <P>When a matter goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in the manner suggested, the likelihood is there will be a court case. Without setting up a new dedicated section in the High Court and without dealing with the court&rsquo;s procedures, there is no guarantee this Bill will achieve the objective for which it was introduced, that is, to shorten the length of the planning process.</P>
    <P>We know the problem with Dublin Airport, which is in crisis, has nothing to do with the planning process and everything to do with the ideological Mexican stand-off between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il over competing terminals at the airport. This selfish ideological spat has crucified travellers going through the airport and it makes no economic or common sense. The break-up of Aer Rianta, which has not produced the business plan that former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, wanted for it, has resulted inevitably in conflict between Dublin and Cork airports over the capital cost of the provisions for the latter. This will ultimately reach the courts in Luxembourg through the European Commission and it will be found that Cork Airport cannot off-load its capital cost to Dublin Airport, contrary to the lies told to the people of Cork.</P><Col N="748"/>
    <P>When dividing Aer Rianta into three separate entities under European law such that those entities will compete against one another, it is illegal to place a handicap on one to the effect that it must provide the capital for another. If Aer Rianta were left alone and if the Cabinet had the courage to sack Noel O&rsquo;Hanlon, which is what it really wanted to do, it would not have resulted in the most expensive redundancy package in the history of the State. The issue has not yet gone away and other Administrations will have to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There are many other provisions in the Bill I would like to talk about. I very much welcome the acceptance by the Minister of the Labour Party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill, which resurfaced in the legislation as section 9. It is long overdue. On Committee Stage, my colleague Deputy Gilmore might try to flesh out how this will function legally. The rogue builders are individuals, yet one must consider what would happen if an applicant were a company with two nominated directors. I would like to know how the Minister proposes to deal with circumstances in which a roguish individual who forms Fairfax Construction applies for planning permission under that name, lists the company as having one or two directors, fails to complete an estate in the manner required and applies to build another under the name of another company, using a nominated director. He could be the beneficial owner of the company. We already know, in light of the housing structure in the Dublin area, about the layers of cover that exist to conceal the identity of directors. Perhaps one extra provision is necessary in this regard. As a non-lawyer, I suggest the provisions in the companies legislation, whereby a director who is defective in complying with the law can be struck off and disallowed from being a director, may comprise a belt-and-braces approach to this legislation.</P>
    <P>By spending a couple of hours with a good solicitor, as one might spend a couple of hours with a good tax accountant, one could drive a coach and four through these provisions. If one expects a clerk in a local authority to go to the Companies Office to trawl through the maze of companies set up to provide a fog around the true identity of the owner, one will find it very difficult to ensure that one will not grant planning permission because of the behaviour of a director. I welcome the Bill in principle but, as a legislator, I am not sure it is sufficiently robust to weed out the 5% of people who are gangsters and who give the rest of the building industry a very bad name.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which has been a long time in gestation. The speed of our economic progress over the past 20 years has been such that infrastructural development has not kept pace and we therefore have teething problems throughout the country that need to be addressed. Given that the Bill&rsquo;s objective is to deliver major infrastructural developments quickly, it is important that we enact it sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn alluded to the fact that the various difficulties are an unforeseen consequence of economic growth. It is not only the planning system that is to blame. Politicians must accept a certain amount of blame on foot of the length of time it takes to address needs after they are identified. I refer in particular to how we were told many years ago we would have a metro service to Dublin Airport. I am sure those in the Visitors Gallery can testify to the need for a rail link to the airport. We must ensure that we achieve this sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the Bill will go some way towards speeding up the planning process. The Bill has been criticised on the grounds that it may result in planning decisions being made above and beyond the local authority, thereby weakening local democracy. However, the Bill strengthens local democracy because a key change it proposes is the transfer of the authority to decide on planning applications for strategic infrastructural development from local authorities to the board. However, the board must take account of many locally determined criteria, including local planning guidelines. This process has not necessarily been in operation to date and therefore the support and contribution of local representatives will be strengthened.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Local authority members will have a function they do not have at present. It is one of the greatest myths that local authority members have the ability to determine decisions in planning applications. Members of this House who are former members of local authorities know they have no such authority. The only rights one had as a local authority member to determine anything in planning was as regards the zoning issue. The new Bill gives local authority members a specific function in <Col N="750"/>determining the decisions being made and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I listened to some of the previous speakers who expressed concern about the authority to be vested in a few people when the Bill is passed. We need to have the confidence and courage to vest authority in people. When we look back on a whole variety of major infrastructural planning issues, we can only see the difficulties. Those are the matters we recall most of all. I am thinking in particular of the completion of the M50 motorway in my constituency and the delays that were caused there. Members pointed out that the planning process is not reflective of people&rsquo;s opinions. However, if we decide that a major infrastructural project will be in the national interest, we need to have the courage to grant people who will make these decisions the authority to do so.</P>
    <P>It is a fair assumption that a project of strategic importance will always be in the national interest. That is why it is particularly appropriate that section 37 of the Act provides in great detail how a project of national strategic importance will be defined. This is an important feature. A difficulty in our planning programme at the moment, which has been alluded to, is confidence as regards matters being fair, and that they are being dealt with in an independent and transparent manner. Again, I see the relevant provision is included in the notes to pre-planning discussions. Like others who spoke, I believe these are beneficial aspects. It is good to write in the notes and the status of the notes into the legislation, with the discussions that may have taken place so that this material is available for public consultation.</P>
    <P>Reservations people might have had with the Bill and the establishment of a new Department to deal with major infrastructural concerns are being and will be met. I echo Deputy Olivia Mitchell&rsquo;s comments that we should try, where possible, because of the major infrastructural nature of the planning to take place, to alert residents to what is intended. In London, for instance, where I lived, the local authority would give notice of a major infrastructural development that was taking place. This is wise because while I accept local authorities often take out advertisements in newspapers, not everyone necessarily reads them nowadays. Increasingly, people are reading newspapers on the Internet and do not have access to the advertisements in local newspapers. This needs to be addressed. As we embrace newer technologies it must be borne in mind that newspapers are not as widely read as in the past. The requirement now to insert planning notices in newspapers is somewhat outdated. Notices should be sent out to local residents, given the important nature of the strategic development to take place. Presumably it will be a major national investment, in any event.</P>
    <P>One issue appears to have been omitted from the Schedule 7 of the Bill, which the Minister might like to consider. I am concerned that in my interpretation of that Schedule, I did not notice <Col N="751"/>the inclusion of offshore wind turbines. That is something we need to consider. It may be that they can be interpreted under one of the other items listed, but I did not get the impression that they were included. We need to include them as I believe in the long-term future of offshore deep sea wind turbine generation capacity of this country. We need to address all these matters and have the capacity to anticipate the future needs of the country in the current legislation being drawn up. I request that this be put in and facilitated on Committee Stage. It may well be interpreted differently, but I am conscious of the need to develop and build interconnectors, not just with the UK, but with continental Europe too in the long term. If there is scope within the Schedule, the interconnector question should be accommodated.</P>
    <P>I welcome sections 10 and 11 which deal with the streamlining of the judicial review process. We need to have a fairly rapid end to the planning process. One criticism made is that the Bill alters the nature of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, from being an independent appellant authority to a development control body, but I do not believe it does. The development of the new permanent strategic infrastructure division, as provided for in section 18, will have changed that element of it. However, I do not believe people need to be concerned that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has changed. I welcome the Bill and look forward to its swift passage though the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The Minister, when speaking in the House yesterday, was correct in saying the economy had developed much since the 1980s, with enormous increases in population and employment. There is a serious need for the country&rsquo;s infrastructure to catch up with this massive development.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Coming from the west, I believe that infrastructure is the future to everything. Without the proper infrastructure the necessary jobs will not be attracted to one&rsquo;s locality. It is critically important therefore that these essential infrastructural projects go through planning and take place on time and within budget. I am extremely conscious of that in the west. I welcome the comments of Deputy Quinn on the infrastructure and the road network throughout the west and how that might link into the rest of the country. I was disappointed in the past when the Labour Party did not support the two-regional approach for Objective One status, when that campaign was going on over five years ago. Having said that, I welcome its approach now. It seems to be an interesting standpoint at this juncture, shortly before a general election, but obviously it is something that is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the enormous difference that the national development plan has made in terms of major infrastructural projects. I <Col N="752"/>agree that this is the case. Everybody acknowledges that the country has improved greatly in recent years. However, as I have said many times, I am disappointed with aspects of non-delivery of the national development plan in the BMW region, particularly today when there is a &euro;3.65 billion underspend in the region. Some &euro;500 million of that alone relates to national primary roads. The Minister will be very conscious of that. Throughout the west many representations have been made to the National Roads Authority to try to get major infrastructural road projects funded. Unfortunately, people are being sent away, cap in hand, and told to be happy with the projects they have at the moment since the funding is not there for additional projects. That simply is not the case.</P>
    <P>Approximately three weeks ago, the National Roads Authority produced a report at the back of which there were two maps, one for 2005 and one for 2006. The maps showed in colour the projects that started and concluded in those years. What was common between the two maps was that one could almost believe the west was not part of the country. On the 2006 map there is a tiny red line, about 2 mm in length, and this is the only line in Connacht included in the plans. That line represents the Charlestown bypass which is being funded this year. If we are serious about balanced regional development and about developing the whole country in our massive growth surge, we cannot sit back and ignore what is before us in these maps. The situation was never so obvious as it is in this report.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned this matter in the House time and again through parliamentary questions to the Minister for Transport and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I have been told that it is not a matter for the Minister but for the NRA, but I disagree. It is not a matter for the NRA. It is Government policy and part of the national development plan. The national development plan determines how money is spent and these decisions are made by Government. This means they come through the Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet. I ask for this to be examined in the short remaining period of the current national development plan.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We are all conscious that from 2007 on, the new plan will no longer focus on the regions. We have already moved from the two-region approach to the national spatial strategy. I do not care what strategy is used because whatever the strategy, it does not have an impact on the west. This situation must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because it is important to streamline the planning process for strategic projects. People in the west know about strategic projects and I will mention a few. The Minister referred to Transport 21 and the western rail corridor, which is certainly a strategic project for the people in the west. It makes no difference how quickly the planning process is with regard to this project. The Minister set a deadline for the com<Col N="753"/>pletion of phase 1 for 2014, and there was certainly no need to bring in a new Bill to streamline the process if this was the timescale. This project does not even need to go through much of the planning process because it is ready to roll. It could be fast-tracked under the existing Transport 21 plan. I know the timescales in the plan are indicative, but I urge the Minister to fast-track the western rail corridor. That would be appreciated.</P>
    <P>When talking about infrastructure we include roads, rail and air. One of the most strategic infrastructure developments for people in the west is Knock airport, and they are concerned about its future development and the impact it could have on the region. The airport requires a major investment of approximately &euro;40 million. It has come on in leaps and bounds under current management over the past five years. They should be commended, but they also need the support of Government to continue the work they have been doing so well.</P>
    <P>I must also mention another strategic project for the area and for the country, the Corrib gas project. This must have an impact on the thinking that goes into this Bill. It is important to consider this project because it is important to look at the mistakes that have been made in a project of this size, especially the delay in progressing the project. The interests of local people and the democratic process are also important. We must consider whether people had a fair say and whether they were listened to. The role of the Department must also be considered. There must be some criticism of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with regard to the issues highlighted throughout the consent process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about other Ministers and Ministers of State, including Deputy Fahey and others? Do they have responsibility?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ryan will have the opportunity to make his contribution shortly. The point I am trying to make relates to operations under the Department at that early stage when the Shell company was allowed engage in a self-monitoring process. I mention this because I welcome the decision in the Bill to move that type of consent project that operated under the Department. It is important to have the one-stop shop to deal with projects of this nature to ensure this situation is not repeated. For the process to work, people must have confidence in it. If a report issues from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, one must have some confidence in the process that generates the particular approach. I was disappointed at the time that self-monitoring was allowed in such a large strategic project. I hope that the type of mistakes made on this project will be sorted out under this Bill.</P><Col N="754"/>
    <P>I note that three categories of infrastructure projects will be covered in the Bill. I welcome the consultation process provided for in section 37(b). The dual approach where one had to go through the local authority and then to An Bord Plean&aacute;la involved duplication and prolonged the planning process. Everybody knew an application would end up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la so it might as well have gone straight to it. There is no point in an application going on for a number of years and then falling at the last hurdle while nobody knows what is happening up to then. Many of the problems of the various stakeholders in local communities could be ironed out at the early stages by the consultation process and I welcome its inclusion.</P>
    <P>I do not worry about the independence of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. If anything, I have been annoyed in the past by how almost untouchable the board is. Nobody understands how it operates with regard to making decisions.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the role of councillors. I compliment the Minister and, having been a councillor for seven years, welcome the fact that the opinions of councillors will be taken into consideration. In the past officials listened to councillors with one ear without taking any heed of their input, despite the fact they are the democratically elected representatives of the local people.</P>
    <P>There are other matters I would like to mention but my time has concluded. I hope the Bill has a speedy passage through the House. I am happy to support it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I believe in integrated planning, including the timely delivery of critical infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister placed the need for this Bill in the context of the national spatial strategy, regional guidelines and county development plans. Section 27 of the Planning and Development Act requires local authorities to have regard to regional planning guidelines in force for their areas when making and adopting a development plan. Unless this occurs, it is impossible to plan strategically.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to two issues in this regard and refer to a court case relating to one of these. In the case of McEvoy &amp; Smith <i>v.</i> Meath County Council a judgment was handed down on 5 November 2002 by Mr. Justice Quirke. I will quote two sections of the judgment.</P>
    <P LI="1">The evidence adduced at the hearing of these proceedings strongly suggests that in a number of respects the Meath plan does not comply with the guidelines and indeed in some of its provisions it has substantially departed from the guidelines policy and objectives. Navan is <Col N="755"/>the only &ldquo;development centre&rdquo; identified in the guidelines for which any growth other than for local needs is recommended. Nonetheless elected members at electoral area meetings have decided to zone large amounts of land for residential purposes in dozens of small towns in a manner which appears to be quite inconsistent with the recommendations of the guidelines. As I have already indicated none of these decisions appear to have been made in the context or against the background of any consideration of the guidelines. In many instances &ldquo;local interests&rdquo; appear to have overcome the concepts &ldquo;local needs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The judgment continues:</P>
    <P LI="1">Whilst I am conscious of the fact that to a material extent, the guidelines were intended to be implemented by such zoning decisions, I take the view that the guidelines are themselves flawed to an extent in that they are and remain incomplete in failing to identify and define the type of consideration which they expect planning authorities to give them. Accordingly, although the nature and extent of the consideration given by the elected members of the Respondents to the Guidelines in the zoning of land for residential purposes gives rise to concern (and indeed unease), I am not satisfied that the evidence adduced on behalf of the applicants has established that, when making and adopting the Meath plan, the respondent failed to (have regard to) the Guidelines within the meaning of section 27 of the Act of 2000.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The second case to which I want to draw attention relates to strategic planning for County Kildare. The regional plan aims to allow Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth to grow to have populations of 15,000 each. The 2002 census showed that Leixlip had a population of more than 15,000 even before the regional plan was adopted. Land had been zoned at that time to provide for yet more development in the town. The population of Celbridge was approximately 200 short of 15,000 at that time and is likely to have exceeded 20,000 by the time the next census is undertaken. Balanced regional development will not and cannot occur unless the strategic plans are credible and adhered to. It will be impossible to plan and fund strategic infrastructure projects if that does not happen. Section 27 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was identified by Mr. Justice Quirke in his judgment, needs to be amended because it is at the core of strategic planning.</P>
    <P>Delays in delivering infrastructure often relate to delays in approving projects. Approval was not given to proposals which had been supplied to the Department almost four years earlier until water from the regional waste water treatment plant at Sallins started spilling into the River Liffey <Col N="756"/>upstream of Fingal&rsquo;s water treatment plant, which provides water to north and west Dublin, north Kildare and parts of Meath. The approval in question was only given on an incremental basis. Such delays are not caused by problems in the planning system.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred earlier in this debate to the Transport 21 proposals such as the interconnector project, which will facilitate an additional 75 million passengers when it is finished in ten years&rsquo; time. I hope it is finished on time. The proposed electrification of key railway lines is another example of a project that will not be pursued for many more years. We will not need to fast-track the planning system in such instances, because it will be possible to pursue them in parallel with other projects which are required.</P>
    <P>I realise my time is limited so I want to highlight some other issues briefly before I conclude. I warmly welcome the changes in section 9 which will give extra powers to local authorities to weed out rogue developers. It is a very positive initiative. There is a provision there already, but this will reverse the responsibility, obviously, which is important.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the consequences of project-splitting in the Rossport case. The community there was unable to make an adequate input into the proposal to develop a pipeline. Project-splitting did not lead to fast-tracking in that instance &mdash; if anything, it slowed the process. If we give the public time to interact with the planning process, we will make an investment in good decision making.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the planning appeals board should be turned into a planning authority. I agree with the EU&rsquo;s reasoned judgment that the fees charged at local authority level are wrong. The fees are substantially less than the fees which are charged by the planning appeals board. I would like the Minister, when he responds at the end of this debate, to clarify how this Bill will impact financially on people who make submissions, contributions or objections.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister&rsquo;s coalition partners used their Private Members&rsquo; time in the Seanad this week to debate the issue of management companies. We know about the problems which exist in that regard. I hoped, nine months after I identified the issue in the D&aacute;il, that we would be starting to see some resolutions in this respect. I am unhappy that some measures in this area have not been included in the Bill. There are serious problems with green spaces in older housing estates. When developers left the estates decades ago, local authorities took roads and utilities in charge but not green spaces. The name of the original developer is still on the title for many green spaces. Some greedy developers have re-emerged to seek to build on green spaces on foot of the Government&rsquo;s introduction of increased densities. This Bill represents an opportunity to add suitable protections, for example by means of <Col N="757"/>amendment. I intend to present some amendments to that end.</P>
    <P>I will speak briefly about the issue of community gain, which has been used in County Kildare to get amenity land for sporting use and for school sites. People who own land are concerned about what they call its &ldquo;hope value&rdquo;. It is often impossible to deliver amenity land for sporting facilities. This is the only way in which it can be delivered. I cannot say I am enthusiastic about this approach, but it is often the case that it has to be done in this way. This approach has delivered some valuable facilities in north Kildare.</P>
    <P>The Minister&rsquo;s comment yesterday that &ldquo;the Government is investing 5% of our gross national product in public infrastructure&rdquo; highlights the extent to which we need to catch up. This Bill used to be called the critical infrastructure Bill. It is critically important that we match infrastructure to population. We will not have balanced regional development if we do not have some control in this regard. Section 27 of the 2000 Act is of absolute importance to that end. I hope the Minister will consider some amendments in this respect because the section in question is open to being disregarded by local authorities as it stands. It is impossible to plan the funding of critical infrastructure if we do not have a baseline on which that can be done.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak in general terms about some of the issues raised by this legislation. As my contribution will be split, I will consider the Bill in detail when the debate resumes.</P>
    <P>We need to move beyond the message that is often emphasised in the media and in political circles during debates on infrastructural development. I refer to the suggestion that we are incompetent, that we are unable to build things without going over budget and encountering delays and that things always go wrong for us. I do not think such an approach will help us to ensure this country makes progress. Having spent approximately 15 years campaigning in the area of infrastructural development, particularly transport projects, I have confidence in the people who are involved in this sector. I refer to people like Mr. Fred Barry, chief executive officer of the National Roads Authority. Now that the NRA has been given sufficient resources and is able to operate on a grand scale, we are starting to see that it is able to deliver roads which stand up to international comparison and to avail of the best international expertise. Mr. Frank Allen, chief executive officer of the Railway Procurement Agency, is a top-class financier who has worked with the World Bank and other institutions which deliver projects. I am proud that an Irish person like Mr. Allen can deliver internationally. I do not think there is any reason he and his team will not deliver here if we give them the proper resources and structures. I am happy to listen to and value the judgment of someone like Mr. John Henry, <Col N="758"/>director of the Dublin Transportation Office, because his views, analysis, experience and expertise as an engineer and a planner are the best one could get anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P Just="Left">When I consider the ability of officials like those I have mentioned, I am convinced that the ability and talent we need is available to us. Therefore, what is the problem? I have to state clearly and in a neutral and objective manner that, from my experience, the problem is purely political. The Ministers who have been in office for the past ten years have been incompetent and short-sighted in their approach. They have been compromised. They are secretive and insensitive. When one examines the decisions they have made over the past ten years it is clear they have always been political, rather than strategic, in their thinking. This country has suffered as a result of the form of thinking that has been a feature of those at the highest level. Regardless of how good one&rsquo;s officials, planners and engineers are, one has a problem if thinking at the most senior political level is so short-sighted and narrow and is so informed by vested interests. I am confident this State&rsquo;s officials can deliver, but I have no confidence in the ability of the office of the Minister opposite to deliver the right transport, waste and other infrastructure.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister may laugh, but I could give details of the incompetent handling of many projects over the past ten years that has cost the people dearly. The legislation that is enacted by the Minister, Deputy Roche, is not the most important factor in determining whether we succeed &mdash; the most important factor is whether we can get the likes of the Minister and his colleague, Deputy Cullen, out of office. That is necessary if we are to have some proper planning and thinking at the very highest level. I will make more detailed comments on this legislation during the latter part of my speech.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate. Members must consider the issue of the accession of two further countries to the EU, namely, the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania. This will entail the addition of a further 30 million people, which is a considerable number. I understand that Romania has a population of 22.7 million while Bulgaria has a population of approximately 8 million. The two countries are in different states of readiness. Romania <Col N="759"/>has been an applicant for accession to the EU for quite some time and was granted membership to the Council of Europe as long ago as 1993. A subsequent sequence of events started the process.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that approximately 95% of Romania&rsquo;s citizens want to join the EU and are active and enthusiastic in this regard. The high level of support for European integration may be explained by the great advantages which EU membership brings. They see how well other member states are doing and the benefits which membership has brought to them.</P>
    <P>On its accession, Romania will become the seventh largest state in the EU and will be quite influential. For example, it will have 35 seats in the European Parliament and will undoubtedly wield significant influence in that forum. Another critical issue concerns Romania&rsquo;s strategic geographical location. It will act as a gateway to other countries, such as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Turkey. It will act as a controlling factor on issues such as visas for those countries.</P>
    <P>On 10 May last, this House celebrated Europe Day by discussing European issues at length. It had discussed the question of Romanian and Bulgarian accession to the EU shortly before that. In general, their applications received support from all sides of the House. Although it was originally intended that they would join on 1 January 2007, I am now uncertain whether this will take place in 2007 or 2008. However, serious negotiations began in December 2004.</P>
    <P>This debate provides Members with an opportunity to take stock and to review the evolution of the European Union. The concept began in the aftermath of the Second World War. The seeds were sown when people rejected war, having become over-familiar with death, pain and the prospect of sending young people out as cannon fodder. In 1950, the French Foreign Minister decided to co-ordinate the French and German coal and steel industries through the formation of a single supranational authority. At the time, that was a far-thinking measure as in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, people were concerned about their own national identities. The French and German initiative to begin to work together in respect of coal and steel was very important as it laid down a new type of thinking in Europe. Shortly afterwards, in 1952, they joined four other countries, namely, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, to form the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1958 this evolved, with the Treaty of Rome, into the EEC, or the Common Market as it was popularly known for a long time.</P>
    <P>Many people ask whether the EU is already sufficiently large. Once one is inside the door, a thinking mechanism emerges to the effect that perhaps enlargement should stop to prevent the EU from becoming too big and unwieldy and that it may be unable to handle further applications.</P><Col N="760"/>
    <P>Thereafter, the EEC worked to converge national economies into a single European economy which was soon to rival the United States as the world&rsquo;s largest trading bloc. While other large trading blocs such as China and India have emerged subsequently, at present Europe is in a position to battle with the best of them. In 1965, the Brussels treaty merged the three existing European organisations into the European Community, which later became the European Union.</P>
    <P>From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, Europe really arrived in 1973, with an expansion which included Ireland, the United Kingdom and Denmark. This was a major step and change for Ireland. Not everyone agreed with the concept and some felt we were selling our national identity or had similar concerns. However, we became part of a wider Europe and we should be proud that as a small nation, we have contributed much to its development. Those who were opposed to entry, if they can remember back that far, might wish to reconsider whether their opposition was misjudged.</P>
    <P>In 1981 Greece joined and was followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986. The big issue at the time was the potential effect their accession might have on the labour market, given the cost of living in such countries, and whether we would be fit to absorb them. However, they have been absorbed well and capably as part of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act, which was enacted in 1987, amended the EC treaties to help create a single internal market, which constituted another major step forward. It was followed by the Maastricht Treaty of the European Union in 1992, which provided for a central banking system, commonly known as the European monetary system. That significant milestone was particularly welcomed by business interests. I know that Britain remains outside that monetary system and I imagine that some British business people look with envy at the seamless currency transactions in the rest of Europe. Some day, the British will see the error of their ways. This hang-up pertains to their fear of losing their national identity. However, they will see the wisdom in joining at some point. While their business community already does so, they have a nationalistic instinct not to surrender, at a cost to themselves in currency transactions. With the euro, people in Ireland can directly compare prices and labour costs to those which obtain in other regions. These constitute some of the advantages which we enjoy.</P>
    <P>The accession of ten new states in May 2004 was another significant milestone for Europe. People probably became concerned in this regard, although this is true every time the EU opens its doors for expansion. Luckily, however, such concerns have been unfounded thus far. People expressed major concerns regarding the impact of inflows of immigration into our labour market. To date, it has not done us any harm, although this might change in the future.</P><Col N="761"/>
    <P>In 2003, the EU embarked on military missions and EU troops were deployed to Macedonia, Congo and, later, Bosnia. In 2004, it was agreed to admit Bulgaria and Romania, with Croatia to follow. The question of Turkey&rsquo;s admission was deferred and many issues remain to be dealt with in that regard. As I stated, there is a tendency on the part of citizens of countries which have entered the EU to be reluctant to consider further enlargement and to state that it is already big enough.</P>
    <P>To move on, both countries must grapple with quite a number of issues before they can be accepted. There are issues in respect of the free movement of people, as well as human trafficking between different countries. There are concerns about Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to continue to grow and to accept immigrants. However, business people state that the demand for labour is such that we will need more than 60,000 people per annum to keep our economy going. If we continue at that rate, the bubble is not likely to burst for a number of years to come. Approximately 135,000 people have come from the ten accession countries since May 2004, which is a considerable number. Some 62,000 are expected to come in the next year. There are differences of opinion as to the percentage that they represent. Some people believe the EU non-Irish nationals account for approximately 2% of the population and non-Irish nationals in total account for approximately 3%. However, some people believe that 8% or 9% of our workforce is made up of non-Irish nationals. It certainly appears that way as I keep meeting quite a few of them. We are still able to cater with these numbers.</P>
    <P>Rather than guessing how many people might come from Romania and Bulgaria, we should have a logical method for carrying out research on the matter. I understand that Britain has carried out research into the number of people it expects to come from Bulgaria and Romania. We need a scientific method to analyse the numbers we expect to come. We need to be properly prepared and have the proper information. I believe the recently held census will be very revealing regarding the number of non-Irish nationals living here. We will have that information in the autumn and it will allow us to get our housekeeping together and see what is what. We have had ways of figuring this out. To some extent we are guessing at the number of people that might come. Someone recently referred to a back-of-the-envelope guess at the number of people coming.</P>
    <P>The two countries concerned have a number of housekeeping issues to address. They were put on notice some time ago and they know they have many issues to correct before they can be admitted. Money laundering is a major issue and we have seen reference to it in this country recently. It is a major issue in Bulgaria. Fraud, corruption and judicial reform are major issues and can be endemic in a system, making them hard to root <Col N="762"/>out. I would have concern about the political influence certain gangs have in those countries. We have heard that in some countries with corrupt systems they claim ownership of a number of politicians. If they have had access to money for such a period, I am concerned they might have corrupted many people.</P>
    <P>We cannot be seen to lower the bar to facilitate the entry of these countries to the EU. Too many issues are at stake and they would need to be seen to have taken sufficient steps to have made a positive impact. The safety of nuclear power plants in Bulgaria could present difficulties. That country needs to take steps to ensure the safe storage of nuclear material. Earlier I referred to human trafficking, which is the most despicable abuse of human rights. There is evidence that human trafficking is a problem and that gangs are involved in this activity in Bulgaria.</P>
    <P>Considerable money will be allocated to ensure these countries move in the right direction. In the initial three-year period, approximately &euro;9 billion will be allocated to help make the transition. We might regard all the regions in those countries as being poor. However, the poor regions will get in excess of &euro;8 billion. The farming community will get in excess of &euro;1 billion. Some &euro;350 million will be allocated to address nuclear safety. The translators and administrators will need to get a share of money to help them come up to speed. The farmers in Bulgaria and Romania will get 25% of EU payments in 2007, increasing gradually each year so that the direct payments will reach the same level as the rest of the EU in 2016, one decade after the planned accession of the two countries. While that may seem a long time away, ten years will not be long passing.</P>
    <P>The Commission assesses the amount of direct payments to the two countries in the first three years at &euro;1.3 billion, which is a considerable amount. Agriculture will be the main beneficiary. Given the amount involved, it will need to be seen to go into a safe system. There is a major incentive for Romania and Bulgaria to get their houses in order. It is good that they have a keen interest in wanting to join the European Union. I look forward to them being in a fit state to join us in some years&rsquo; time.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>None of the contributors to this debate has argued against the accession of either Romania or Bulgaria to the European Union, nor would they argue against the future accession of other countries on the European Continent to the European Union. However, this debate offers us the opportunity to discuss how the accession process has been handled and how future accessions are likely to be handled. We ought to be more precise about the definitions of the Continent of Europe and the organisation that is the European Union.</P>
    <P>This week has seen the birth of a new nation, Montenegro, a country of similar size to Ireland but with a population of only 650,000. There is <Col N="763"/>a possibility of other areas of the Balkan region becoming independent in the future, Kosovo being a case in point. Certain nations are considered regions of larger nation states, such as the Basque country and Catalonia. In our near neighbour, the status of Scotland and Wales may be subject to change in the future. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the European Union within the course of this century may become an organisation of 50 states, which is before we discuss where we define the borders of Europe.</P>
    <P>The most contentious of the future accessions is that of Turkey, which has a small part of its territory in Europe but is largely in Asia. Some tentative inquiries have been made about countries in north Africa because of their former colonial relationship with some of the main members of the European Union. Some countries in Asia Minor and the Middle East, such as Israel and Lebanon, if it becomes more settled, may want to be considered as part of this process.</P>
    <P>This is before we consider the part of Europe outside the Balkans that has not even got onto the first step of the ladder, including the former republics of the Soviet Union like Ukraine, Belarus &mdash; which would be very low on the list given its situation &mdash; and the countries of the Caucasus such as Armenia and Georgia, which have been going through their own trials and tribulations as they try to become more democratic nations. The failure to define the geography of the European Union has led us down a number of blind alleys. The Government of the day needs to be more forceful in asking questions at EU level because there is potential for a large number of countries to become member states. How, when and under what circumstances they become members need to be handled carefully.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It took 17 years for the first countries to accede to the Union after it was established and Ireland was among them. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a number of accessions took place until the Union numbered 15 members. It was then decided to pursue the big bang approach to accession, resulting in ten countries being admitted under the Irish Presidency two years ago. One wonders whether this was done for proper strategic or structural reasons or whether the motive was more political. Many of the countries had turned to communism following the Second World War and they needed to align with more democratic societies in western Europe. However, it is curious that the first port of call for these countries as they changed politically was NATO rather than the EU. The need for a security-based state was more pressing than the need for a democratic society. Perhaps, given their history, that was understandable.</P>
    <P>Given that trend, Ireland should play a more positive role in defining the EU and what it should become. We have been led unnecessarily through a succession of treaties which define the EU as this part of the world&rsquo;s approach to the <Col N="764"/>US. The EU cannot and should not be that. It is a collection of nation states whose citizens identify first with them as they affect their own lives. This important principle gets lost in the wider debate about the Union.</P>
    <P>My party has been constantly derided as eurosceptic, but we have constantly argued that is not the case. We have always favoured a different and better Union. The treaties passed since the implementation of the Single European Act in the 1980s have followed a trend towards a monolith, which has positioned the institutions of the Union further away from the people they are meant to represent. Unfortunately, our argument has not been permitted to be heard in Irish political discourse because it is considered to be heresy. It has been to the detriment of our system that we have not had a more wide-ranging debate on the nature of the Union and what it could and should be.</P>
    <P>Those who have sought to support the <i>status quo </i>and unquestioningly support the Union and its institutions have done the State and its people a disservice because they have always sought to make arguments about the future in terms of whether one is in or out, but it is not such a black and white scenario. As the Union evolves and history is rewritten and made, people in every member state should be involved. That has not happened, which means unnecessary fears have been created, especially in the oldest member states. It is no accident that the constitutional treaty was rejected emphatically in France and the Netherlands and, sadly, that the rejection was based on people&rsquo;s fears of being exposed to economic and cultural threats from the citizens of other states. It is sad that, 60 years after the Second World War, such fears are being expressed.</P>
    <P>Ireland should play a more positive role in this regard. The best way to do that is by having an open debate, asking the necessary questions and putting forward alternative models. The Government has been too acquiescent in accepting a drift towards the monolith approach of the Union. Given that the constitutional treaty is dead and buried and cannot be resuscitated because the French and the Dutch will not vote for it, we must devise a different and better model. In doing so, more countries will accede to the Union, including Bulgaria and Romania who are expected to join next. Both countries should be warmly welcomed, although their economic development must catch up with the European average, but that can be achieved in the short term.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is also important that we should make our experience known to the countries who joined in 2004 and to those who intend to accede in the coming years. It is not a given that these countries will catch up economically and it will not happen as quickly as people might have been led to believe. During the first 15 years of its membership of the Union, Ireland experienced difficult economic circumstances which resulted in <Col N="765"/>increased inflation and unemployment rates. The advent of the European Single Market resulted in significant benefits for the State as foreign direct investment increased and foreign companies were encouraged to establish businesses here, resulting in increased exports.</P>
    <P>Ironically, the enlargement of the Union could be a threat to our economic prosperity, despite how wealth is distributed internally. Foreign direct investment is most likely to be attracted to central Europe, which has a significant population and offers reduced transport costs, as countries in the region offer the same advantages we claim to offer in education and taxation. When the accession of other countries is debated, we should always review our position within the Union and how we will be affected.</P>
    <P>The Union is seeking to address concerns about whether Bulgaria and Romania are likely to meet the entry criteria laid down for them by the end of the year. We must reflect on concerns among our citizens about social progress in these countries. With regard to Romania, there are concerns about the treatment of the Roma, the mentally ill and abandoned children. These important issues must be addressed before accession occurs. My concern regarding Bulgaria is that Irish people are taking advantage of the economic circumstances in the country, which could retard its economic development. As I travel around the country, I regularly see signs advertising the sale of property in Bulgaria at various exhibitions. It is a rich irony, given our history that auctioneers are selling the notion of buying up these countries by lot and creating an army of absentee landlords. I had hoped the Government would have offered better moral leadership in this area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has boasted that 100,000 Irish people own property in many accession countries.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is unfair. The Taoiseach made a factual statement and did not boast.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>His tone was boastful. He suggested such property ownership should be a badge of pride. However, the failure to re-invest in Ireland will be to our disadvantage in the long term while we take advantage of countries embarking on their own economic journey.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>There is no fundamental disagreement in widening the EU and accepting more members. There are difficulties in figuring out how that can be done via proper governance structures. If 25 or 50 people are around the table, how do we agree on decisions? The fact that all members are there is not a matter for dissension in this House, nor should it be. The problem is about what the EU wants to represent and the degree to which it wants to have the vestiges of a nation state. There are principles of subsidiarity and talk of decentralisation &mdash; however debased that has become in Irish politics in recent times &mdash; but the reality is <Col N="766"/>that the majority of legal instruments are not produced in this Chamber but in the European Parliament and through the European Commission.</P>
    <P>We have already decided that there are areas in which this policy is useful. As a member of the Green Party, I believe that most environmental decisions can only be made at a European level. However, there are other areas in which we must ask questions. There are EU pressures on key elements of economic policy. Many of the larger members of the EU are pushing for the idea of tax harmonisation. The services directive undermines the value of workers in member states, although we wait to see how the European Parliament will deal with it.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In spite of the fact that most of these legal instruments have been decided outside this Chamber, we must acknowledge our failure to question and amend such instruments in the Oireachtas. The sheer scale of the directives, coming from Brussels makes it virtually impossible for any degree of proper scrutiny to occur. The Government needs to use this period of reflection to accept that this scrutiny process must be drastically reformed. The number of instruments that must be introduced and the timeframe involved in scrutinising them must be defined. An opportunity must exist to opt in and out of these instruments if they are not central issues.</P>
    <P>The example of the US has often been used in this debate. While it is not directly applicable &mdash; I argued earlier that we should not compare the EU to the US &mdash; the US federal system allows for a body of laws by the individual states and laws of the nation. We should do something similar for many European laws. There should be a level of legislation which would apply across all member states, another level &mdash; like certain directives &mdash; which member states could join over a given period, as well as a level of legislation which member states could choose to opt in or out. Unfortunately, such an area has not been properly addressed.</P>
    <P>It is apposite that we discuss this Bill today. A delegation from the Bulgarian Parliament is visiting the Oireachtas today. Its representatives will have a meeting with members of the Committee of Public Accounts this afternoon and I welcome them to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. I hope the experience will have a long-term benefit to our countries. This Bill will not be opposed by the Green Party. We still await clear indications from the European Commission on whether the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will take place in 2007. If there are remaining grey areas, we await an indication of what they are and how they will be addressed. Aside from that, I look forward to both Romania and Bulgaria becoming a part of the European Union.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate. Following the general election in 2002, a Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill was brought to a Select Committee <Col N="767"/>on European Affairs. I was Chairman of the committee and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, put it through the committee. This took place before any other committee had been set up and it was very healthy cross-party co-operation. That Bill, when enacted, gave the Oireachtas extensive powers in scrutinising EU legislation in its embryonic stage, through the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the sub-committee on European scrutiny. Within five weeks of the Government receiving a proposal for European legislation, be it a regulation, directive or decision, the sub-committee on European scrutiny must also receive it in a certain format with advice on its importance and significance for Ireland. That was a very significant development.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on European Affairs has been given other powers by the House under Standing Orders which it used when I was Chairman of the committee. It is very difficult to get coverage because the business of the meeting is serious. In addition to scrutinising draft regulations and directives, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs come to the committee to discuss the agenda on the forthcoming General Affairs and External Relations Council. This process has some way to go, but it has been a good development. The sub-committee on EU scrutiny looks at all the regulations and decides which should be scrutinised in greater detail. These are then sent to the relevant Oireachtas committees for further scrutiny. It is then a matter for the elected representatives on those committees to decide what is to be done.</P>
    <P>There is one downside to all of this. We discovered that what are known as decisions were being taken by the European Council and these decisions did not come before us for scrutiny. We made it clear that this was unacceptable and we were assured that decisions would come before the sub-committee on EU scrutiny in future. A decision to use Irish taxpayers&rsquo; funds to experiment on embryos in other member states was taken behind closed doors by the T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. We believed it was inappropriate to make such a decision without scrutiny, so we sent the matter to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which has responsibility for scientific research. That committee made a recommendation against the decision but the T&aacute;naiste simply ignored the will of the Houses.</P>
    <P>We established these procedures because, if Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money cannot be used for research on embryos here because of the constitutional protection for the unborn, why should it be used to fund research in other member states? If they want to conduct research, let them use their taxpayers&rsquo; money. A number of member states have serious concerns about the matter but <Col N="768"/>even though it is now up for reconsideration under the seventh framework programme and despite the recommendation of the joint committee, Ireland has not changed its position. I have urged the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to reconsider the position because there is otherwise no point in scrutinising matters and making recommendations. Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money should not be spent on embryonic research in other member states or put into the European research fund if we cannot conduct the same research here. Irrespective of how I or any Minister feels about the matter, the Houses have spoken and that is an important part of the scrutiny process.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, as soon as Bulgaria and Romania are admitted to the EU, the better. It is merely a matter for the two countries to be able to take on the <i>acquis</i> and demonstrate they meet the requirements of functioning democracies, which I hope will happen by early next year. The parliaments of Bulgaria and Romania have already sent observer members to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I do not know what will happen when the former Yugoslav republics apply for membership. Montenegro wants to join the EU on its own, Croatia will join in the not too distant future and Serbia will join when it is able to function as a democracy. We will face significant issues in governing an EU of more than 30 member states, particular in light of the uncertainty around the future of the constitutional treaty. Nonetheless, we must remind ourselves as the Second World War recedes into the past that the central hope of the European Union is peace and stability on the Continent of Europe. Approximately 60 million people died in Europe during the first half of the last century because of a lack of peace and stability. Everything after peace and stability is a bonus and we certainly cannot have prosperity without them. It is better to solve the problem of developing governing structures for 30 and more states than to deal with a panzer division massing on the border. Solutions to the challenges which will undoubtedly arise as the EU enlarges can be found through politics. Clearly, Bulgaria and Romania are on the verge of membership and we should ensure they join as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to make my next point as carefully and sensitively as I can. I have never made a racist or intolerant comment or said anything against immigrants, but I think problems are arising in respect of immigration which needs to be addressed more proactively, not only by the Government but also by the community. This lunchtime, I attended a meeting in Ballyfermot, where a project has been established to involve indigenous and immigrant communities in planning for greater integration in the Dublin 10 area. Recently, I spoke in the European Parliament about Pearse Park in Crumlin, Dublin 12, where each year on the first bank holiday of the summer, Crumlin United and another group organise <Col N="769"/>a sports against racism festival. The festival is a fantastic idea which brings together soccer teams from Ireland, Poland, Romania and elsewhere, as well as Gaelic football and hurling teams. By bringing together people from all over the world to compete in sport, exchange food and music and hold a joyful event, sport is used to break down racism and integrate people. Racism often emerges at sporting events, so it is fantastic that Crumlin United and its partners can organise this annual event. These ground level efforts need to be encouraged and supported because they are positive and welcome.</P>
    <P>I do not want to score any party political points when I say that we also need action from the top. I am a former Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for European affairs. Like the current Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, my responsibilities included co-ordinating European issues across Departments. I prepared for meetings with the help of officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs, who would signal the difficulties they encountered in various Departments. As a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, I could threaten people who were dragging their heels with the involvement of the Taoiseach if they did not resolve their problems by our next meeting. The ability of a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to co-ordinate issues such as European integration and prepare for European Presidencies has proven useful.</P>
    <P>The integration of immigrants will become even more important with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania and, unless this is co-ordinated from the top as well as encouraged on the ground, this country will face serious problems. Currently, 80,000 housing units are being built each year, which is approximately equal to the numbers built in the United Kingdom. If we are to be honest with ourselves, we will have to admit that this boom will not continue indefinitely and the best we can hope for is a soft landing. When that happens, fewer workers will be needed in the construction industry and, if these workers cannot find jobs to suit their skills, they will look for scapegoats.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who present at my constituency clinic to seek services such as public housing or social welfare benefits accuse immigrants of receiving a disproportionate level of State support. I tell such people, who often confuse immigrants with asylum seekers and make absurd claims, not to turn on other vulnerable groups. I heard a nonsensical anecdote about three immigrants who could not make room for their push-car in a taxi and so decided to leave it behind because they could get another one from the health board. Even though this and similar stories are totally untrue, people tell them without being challenged. I was once threatened with the Equality Authority after an appearance on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; by somebody who <Col N="770"/>thought I said &ldquo;old people&rdquo; are the worst, when I actually used the term &ldquo;older people&rdquo;. Older people, who one would expect to have a more balanced view of life, are often the ones to make false claims against immigrants.</P>
    <P>I say this for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration and for the record. A Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach or the Chief Whip, who is also a Cabinet member, should be appointed to co-ordinate immigrant issues across all Departments in the way the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European Affairs co-ordinates European issues. I refer not only to asylum and visas but to policies on anti-racism, integration, housing, health, social welfare and public education, and to educating the new ethnic communities in how to integrate, respect each other&rsquo;s tradition and culture and live side by side.</P>
    <P>I often use the following words in the debate on Europe. Europe is not about assimilation, where we all have to be the same, Europe is about integration, where Roman Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Jews, non-believers, French, German and Irish work together, side by side. In debating this issue we must remind ourselves of this. It will mean that people will travel here as part of that integration process and we must ensure that we double our efforts to bring that integration principle home here. The way to do it is to have a Minister to co-ordinate it. We do not need a new Department with a Cabinet Minister because different Departments already do different things.</P>
    <P>A Minister of State, the Chief Whip for example, should co-ordinate these issues. There used to be committees such as the Geoghegan-Quinn committee, the Kitt committee and the Mitchell committee, which were presumably named after the incumbent Minister during the last Presidency. We should have committees like those and if an issue arises relating to a particular Department, that Minister would co-ordinate the action taken rather then leave the relevant Minister to deal with it alone. Senior civil servants under the chairmanship of the Minister would co-ordinate the action on the issue. I ask that this idea be examined. For a long time, preceding the last election, I have had a motion on the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il seeking the appointment of such a Minister. It is time somebody proactively took responsibility.</P>
    <P>I genuinely fear that simmering beneath the surface there is a serious potential problem with immigrants, and not all of it is caused by the indigenous Irish population. Immigrants often do not know what is expected of them. Sometimes they have ideas about what they should get, and when they do not get it they think it is because they are immigrants. We must nip those problems in the bud.</P>
    <P>Immigrants are welcome here. I have nothing to say against them. I welcome the idea of multiculturalism, which has many positive aspects. One <Col N="771"/>result has been the growing love for the Irish language in Dublin where Gaelscoileanna have opened. Parents have voted with their feet because they see other people&rsquo;s cultures and they want to keep their own. In our churches many people practice their religions in a way that would put some of us who call ourselves Christian or Roman Catholic to shame and perhaps they can show us some of the things we are forgetting. With these positive aspects come problems with integration that is not proactively managed. Those problems simmer beneath the surface. They must be planned for and ironed out so that we have a peaceful, stable and welcoming community where cultures live side by side in mutual respect.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to participate in this debate and we have heightened our interest in the area of European affairs. In my time as Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs I found that the Minister and Ministers of State were always co-operative, as was any Minister we invited to come before the committee. It is also taken seriously by civil servants, which is a good thing.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; uilig a ghlac p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht an-t&aacute;bhachtach seo. I reiterate that the purpose of this Bill is to allow for the completion of the fifth enlargement by providing for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union. It was gratifying to encounter such strong support for the accession of both Bulgaria and Romania when the Second Stage debate commenced on 10 May. Fittingly, support for this latest phase of EU enlargement came from all sides of this Chamber and on behalf of the Government I thank the many Deputies who spoke positively in favour of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the EU.</P>
    <P>This strong backing for Bulgarian and Romanian membership was reinforced last week when the Select Committee on European Affairs discussed a motion to approve the terms of the accession treaty. The motion was passed by this House yesterday. Our ratification legislation must be passed soon, regardless of the date of accession of Bulgaria and Romania. Under the terms of the accession treaty we are required to ratify it before the end of this year. While we hope the earlier accession date of 1 January 2007 will prove possible, we must follow the established procedures, which require the date to be set out following a recommendation from the European Commission.</P>
    <P>On 16 May the EU Enlargement Commissioner, Mr. Ollie Rehn, presented the European Commission&rsquo;s comprehensive monitoring reports to the European Parliament. He announced that the Commission&rsquo;s final recommendation on the dates of accession will not be <Col N="772"/>made until this autumn. While the European Commission&rsquo;s report about these two countries&rsquo; preparedness for membership was less positive than might have been hoped, the delay in confirming the date of accession will maximise the incentive for reform in both countries in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Like the European Commission, we have been greatly encouraged by both countries&rsquo; progress to date and I hope both Bulgaria and Romania can go the extra mile in addressing the remaining issues so that they can join the European Union on 1 January 2007. Both counties will enjoy Ireland&rsquo;s continued support in their efforts to do so and will also have the support of the European Commission as confirmed today at the National Forum on Europe meeting in Dublin Castle by the Secretary General of the European Commission, Ms Catherine Day.</P>
    <P>Since this debate opened on 10 May a further three member states have informed the Council of their accession ratification. This means that 17 member states have ratified the accession treaty for Bulgaria and Romania. It will be important for Ireland to keep pace with other member states in ratifying the treaty and I hope this Bill can be passed during this summer session allowing for our formal ratification to be completed in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The question of the free movement of workers was raised a number of times during this debate and at the Select Committee on European Affairs last week. Nothing in this Bill relates to the free movement issue, which is a different matter and will be dealt with separately. On 3 May the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, announced that he will propose an amendment to the Employment Permits Bill 2005. This will be an enabling provision to empower the Minister, by regulation, to permit unhindered access or to continue to require Bulgarian and Romanian nationals to have work permits here. This provision will allow the Government to make a decision on labour market access later this year after taking account of all relevant issues, including the prevailing labour market conditions in Ireland and the intentions of other member states. This has been stressed by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions recently.</P>
    <P>The EU&rsquo;s continued development is vital to Ireland. The success of enlargement will shape the future of Europe. All enlargements to date have worked well, strengthening the European Union and contributing to its continued development. The 2004 enlargement was the biggest in the EU&rsquo;s history and the new member states are settling in well. The pessimists have been confounded again as the EU is making a success of the most recent enlargement, notwithstanding its unprecedented scale and ambition. Concerns have been expressed around Europe about further enlargement. These are understandable <Col N="773"/>given the rapid changes that have transformed Europe in the past decade and more.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that these great changes have been positive. The healing of Europe&rsquo;s past divisions has helped make the Continent more stable and secure than it was during the Cold War. There are problems that must be dealt with, such as the need to curb the horrendous practice of human trafficking. A Europe united behind shared values and common aspirations is better placed to confront such problems. It would not be possible to confront human trafficking on a single state basis. EU policies, initiatives and a trans-frontier attitude are critical to ensure working together through the Commission and the EU to confront this terrible situation. It is imperative the EU enlargement policy enjoys popular approval. It is important to communicate a positive message about the fifth enlargement and help assuage natural apprehensions.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Deputy Harkin and others referred to questions submitted by members of the public on Europe Day. These questions raised important issues, will shape our approach to enlargement and will be replied to in writing. Deputy Boyle stated the Green Party is not eurosceptic but he derides the EU as a monolithic entity. He is negative towards the EU constitution, the most democratic treaty proposal in history, giving power to the citizens and the people.</P>
    <P>Our position on the EU constitution is well known. Now is not the time for institutional wrangling. The constitution is the best achievable deal, a finely balanced package disturbance of which risks destabilisation. Now is not the time to press for progress. In time, circumstances will improve, allowing for ratification by all member states. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will meet EU Foreign Minister colleagues in Vienna this weekend to discuss many of the issues raised in this debate.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the passage of this Bill and to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the accession treaty later in the year. I also look forward to welcoming Bulgaria and Romania as full partners in the EU. Their presence will strengthen the EU in future years.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I too am concerned that any child would feel upset in school because of bullying, be it physical, verbal or cyber. I am anxious that all schools have effective practices in place both to prevent bullying and to deal with cases that may arise.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, each school is required to have in place a policy that includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
    <P>My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the needs of their school. My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, has also developed policy guidelines and advisory notes for schools and parents which deal with the issues of Internet and mobile phone bullying.</P>
    <P>The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, is currently developing further guidelines for schools on codes of behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. The process involves drawing up a draft framework discussion document for the guidelines, which is being used as a basis for consul<Col N="775"/>tations with the key stakeholders including school management, teachers, parents, and children. The board has established an expert working group for this purpose. Work on the guidelines is at an advanced stage and it is envisaged that implementation will commence in the next school year.</P>
    <P>Once the NEWB guidelines are in place, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own guidelines on countering bullying behaviour. This review will take into account issues such as legislative developments, the involvement of the support services available to schools, technological advancements such as the Internet, e-mail, mobile and camera phones and the latest developments in international best practice on dealing with bullying behaviour. These guidelines, on top of those that are already in place, will provide vital guidance for schools in fulfilling their responsibilities in this issue.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that dealing with bullying has been incorporated in training for principals through the leadership development for schools programme. I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but of ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that the education of students in both primary and post-primary schools with regard to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. Its curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying.</P>
    <P>While responsibility for tackling bullying naturally falls to the level of the individual school, a wide range of measures are in place to support schools in this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned guidelines, but has she given any further thought to having a national strategy against bullying so that we can ensure it works and that it contains specific aims and targets? I am sure the Minister read the report on the results of a survey carried out in 2004. Some 90% of respondents said their school anti-bullying policy did not refer to lesbian or gay related bullying. Will the Minister send guidelines to schools to deal with homophobic bullying until there is a national strategy in place?</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Minister would agree that the nature of bullying has changed. While we still have traditional bullying, there is now text bullying and bullying on Bebo websites etc. With regard to the guidelines and the consideration of a national strategy, what regard is being given to the changing nature of bullying and to the fact that it is no <Col N="776"/>longer just a schoolyard phenomenon but something that follows children into their homes after school?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>When we take together the work being done by the Department, the NEWB, the NCTE, the leadership development and the curriculum, we could say it is a national strategy. However, it must be implemented at a local school level through all the elements involved and through social, personal and health education.</P>
    <P>We can deal with the issue in two ways. We can deal with the bully and, more particularly, with the victim. We must enable victims to have the skills to cope and ensure they do not tolerate bullying behaviour. I am equally conscious that at school level children should feel that if they make a complaint, it will be dealt with and teachers will follow up on it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the findings of the survey with regard to homophobic bullying, all bullying is wrong. School policies should be careful to include the issue of homophobic bullying. We are conscious of bullying because of race, size, background, abilities and colour, but should be equally conscious of bullying on account of sexual orientation. All types of bullying must be stamped out in the school context.</P>
    <P>There was a time when bullying was more obvious because it was either verbal or physical and therefore it was more easily identified by a teacher. Now, it is more sinister. Young people spend too much time in isolation communicating with others through the Internet, websites and text messaging, without any personal communication. It is much more difficult to tackle bullying in this situation. The website I launched on behalf of the NCTE, <i>www.webwise.ie,</i> is a useful aid for everybody in recognising and dealing with issues concerned with Internet safety.</P>
    <P>All these elements will form part of the guidelines being produced by the NEWB and will, consequently, feed into the work of the Department.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>NEWB officers to whom I have spoken feel that a significant number of children do not attend school because of bullying or fear of it. The Minister mentioned four or five groups, a national strategy would tie their work together. Will she consider that to ensure we have best practice?</P>
    <P>Some 90% of respondents said their schools do not have a policy to deal with homophobic bullying. Will the Minister contact the schools to ensure policies contain this in future?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The strategy exists in effect, but it must be implemented at school level. We should not lose sight of the fact that a policy on bullying can only work if the children, the teachers, the principal, the parents and the board of management sign up to it. Each of these must be familiar <Col N="777"/>with the terms and sanctions of the policy and of how it will be implemented within the school. There is no point in just writing lofty plans. The guidelines are there, but they must be updated when necessary. The NEWB is doing this. The policy must be implemented at school level.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that children should not miss school because of bullying. Televisions programmes aimed at children point out that children should tell and not be afraid to do so. Parents should also encourage children to tell.</P>
    <P>Did the Deputy have another question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about homophobic bullying not being part of policy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A policy should be all-inclusive. Whether homophobic bullying should be given specific mention is for the school to decide, but it should be clear that no form of bullying will be tolerated within the school community.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>her plans to reform the leaving certificate to relieve the stress on students and their families; the timeframe for such plans; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20108/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is potential to reform senior cycle education to ensure there is an emphasis on embedding key skills, such as critical thinking and information processing, and that assessment methods match learning objectives in each subject. I am conscious that if we review the assessment methods and provide for a second assessment component, where appropriate and feasible, we could reduce exam pressure on students. I am determined to ensure we build on the strengths of the existing leaving certificate system, which is widely regarded as fair and is held in high regard internationally. There is much at stake. I owe it to our young people to take action on this issue in a measured and well-thought-out way.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has statutory responsibility for advising me on these matters. When the council made proposals for senior cycle reform last year, I responded by stressing the objectives I have outlined. I addressed this issue when I spoke to the first meeting of the new council last week. I highlighted the need to prioritise proposals in relation to mathematics, science and Irish. The Deputy is aware of my views on how senior cycle Irish should be reformed to place a greater emphasis on the spoken language. I understand the council&rsquo;s recommendations in these areas should be submitted to me early in 2007. The Department of Education and Science is also exploring whether changes to examination timetabling might be feasible from 2007. A number of proposals to reduce exam pressure on students are being considered. The Deputy can <Col N="778"/>be assured of my determination to take action in this regard in a careful and considered way in the interests of our young people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said she intends &ldquo;to take action on this issue in a measured and well-thought-out way&rdquo;. I think the pace of change is far too slow. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s proposals are well thought-out and can be enacted over a considerable period of time, allowing for preparation in the schools etc. Will the Minister produce a timetable for introducing the measures which were proposed in the council&rsquo;s report, which was published in April 2005? In the introduction to its proposals, the council states that they are designed specifically to concentrate on students who are being left out of the system and are dropping out, or are not doing as well as they should. The report states specifically that the council&rsquo;s proposals are designed to encourage more students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to stay in school. Is the Minister concerned that such students are still being failed by the system? There does not seem to be any sense of urgency to do something about it. Many people acknowledge that the leaving certificate applied programme is appropriate for certain students who are not very interested in academic subjects. Will she ensure the programme gets proper recognition, not only in the CAO system which governs entry to third level education but also in the world of work generally? That is one of the most important things we need to do if all students in the system are to enjoy parity of esteem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The standard of the leaving certificate examination is well-recognised throughout the world. I do not intend to change the entire leaving certificate system to suit 14% of students. I will try to preserve its strengths for the 86% of students who go on to sit the examination. Obviously, I have to ensure the 14% of students who tend to fall out of the system and do not get an opportunity to develop their skills are given some options. Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan has quite rightly identified the leaving certificate applied programme, which is very successful and focussed, as one of those options. It should have much more status in society because it is challenging for those students who do it. I would support any proposal to extend the programme, thereby ensuring that more students get an opportunity to pursue it. The programme can be of benefit to students who have behavioural problems. A curriculum of this nature would help not only to tackle their academic needs but also to address the matters which are giving rise to their behavioural difficulties in school.</P>
    <P>I did not set out a timetable for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s recommendations because, as I made quite clear at the time, I do not agree with all of them. For example, I do not agree with the proposal to <Col N="779"/>make transition year part of an integrated three-year senior cycle programme. I am in favour of transition year remaining as a stand-alone year so it can continue to offer opportunities to young people to explore other interests and areas of work, to make choices which will help them in their future careers and lives and to develop other skills. I have asked the council to prioritise the standardisation of transition year modules to encourage more schools, particularly more boys&rsquo; schools and disadvantaged schools, to introduce it.</P>
    <P>The council recommended that students should do a significant number of short courses, but I do not want them to do all the short courses. I asked the council to prioritise enterprise education, which we need to focus on. I suggested to the council that rather than looking at second components in every subject, it should focus on those subjects in which there are particular difficulties. We need to address the issues with mathematics, for example, so I have asked the council to prioritise that subject. I have also asked it to focus particularly on science areas and the Irish language. I have asked the council to get back to me quickly in respect of such priority areas. I would be interested in implementing some suitable proposals in those areas. Not all of the wide-ranging proposals which were submitted last year are ready for timetabling. I did not agree with some of them in any event.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that rote learning, which is what is primarily rewarded in the leaving certificate examination, does not serve the interests of most of the 86% of students who do not drop out of the school system before that examination? Does she agree the examination should examine other kinds of intelligences and skills, in the interests of all children and not just those who drop out?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree. A change in the curriculum is urgently needed, of course.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>A change in the examination system is also needed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment should be looking at that. It should also consider bringing about a system in which there is a second assessment point. We need to give more marks for practical or oral elements of examinations. We are moving in that direction and of course I agree with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have a timetable for that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is already happening. This year, for the first time, 35% of the marks in the junior certificate science examination will be awarded for practical work.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="780"/>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is in the junior certificate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has to build up, obviously. It is already happening in respect of languages. Not only do students take an oral examination, but they now also take an aural examination. I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to ascertain whether 50% of the marks in the leaving certificate Irish examination could be awarded for the oral examination. That would change dramatically the manner in which Irish is taught and learnt. None of the proposals can be introduced immediately because we need to bring about a sea change in teaching and learning. I have asked the council to prioritise mathematics, Gaeilge and science. I would like progress to be made in those areas very quickly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister needs to begin implementing the existing proposals, rather than asking the council to come up with new ideas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start the process of implementation as soon as I get the recommendations, which will not happen until the beginning of next year. I hope I will still be around to implement them.</P>

	<P>The Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and for a new integrated school support programme. The school support programme will bring together and build on a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage. The process of identifying primary and second level schools for participation in the school support programme was managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Department of Education and Science and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the school support programme. Some 640 primary schools &mdash; 320 urban schools and 320 rural schools &mdash; and 200 second level schools were invited to participate and I am delighted that 833 of them, or over 99% have accepted the invitation.</P>
    <P>A review process has been put in place for primary and second level schools which did not qualify for participation in the school support programme, but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is sufficient to warrant inclusion in it. The closing date for the receipt of review applications was Friday, 31 <Col N="781"/>March last. The review process will operate under the direction of an independent person who will be charged with ensuring all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the cases of schools applying for a review. The reviewer will be supported by a nominated member of staff from the Educational Research Centre and an official from the Department of Education and Science. The group will be given all the information and support it needs to carry out its work by the Educational Research Centre and the Department. The review process is under way and it is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The review process applies to primary schools which participated in the Educational Research Centre survey in May 2005 and eligible second level schools for which data were available from the relevant databases. The applications of primary schools which seek a review must relate to data on the relevant variables included in the centre&rsquo;s survey of May 2005 and to the reference date of 30 September 2004. The centre&rsquo;s analysis of its survey returns identified the socioeconomic variables which collectively best predict achievement. The variables were used to identify schools for participation in the school support programme. The applications of second level schools which seek a review must be based on the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the school support programme. Review requests must be evidence-based and based on the variables and reference dates used in the identification process for the programme. Having completed the process for each school requesting a review, the review group will make a recommendation to the Department in the case of each such school. The review process is structured in such a way as to ensure fairness and balance and with the necessary expertise to process and review effectively the more than 300 applications received.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her answer. I have looked at the Question Paper and I assure her that my office did not refer to the Minister as &ldquo;he&rdquo;. That typo happened elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have some supplementary questions. Many principals are concerned that, while some schools have lost disadvantaged status, others in the same feeder area have gained disadvantaged status. They cannot make sense of the process. The issue of greatest concern to principals pertains to schools which have disadvantaged status but which have not been invited to participate in DEIS. Will such schools lose their home-school-community liaison co-ordinator? Many principals are deeply concerned in that regard. What is the situation for new schools? Will they be left out? What mechanism is available to deal with them?</P>
    <P>Many principals are concerned in respect of planning. The present school year has nearly finished and they want to know what their resources will be in order that they can plan for next year. <Col N="782"/>There is talk of planning and monitoring within the school system and as the Minister is aware, schools need resources for this purpose. Will any additional resources be allocated to schools for that purpose?</P>
    <P>Some schools which have been in receipt of funding to improve numeracy and literacy skills will have those funds withdrawn. What can be said to principals of such schools who will state they are being punished for their success and their efforts?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I will outline how some schools were included while others were not. The information was provided by the schools themselves. The list was drawn up entirely objectively based on that information. It is fair to state that while some schools and areas used to be disadvantaged, they are no longer so by virtue of changing economic, employment and demographic circumstances. Similarly, some areas which had never been disadvantaged in the past are so at present. Hence, this scheme was designed to ensure that such schools were included.</P>
    <P>In the past, the Department operated eight different schemes and very few schools were included in all of them. It is unfair to state that schools which are not included in DEIS have now lost their status because they have not. Each participating school was informed that no one would lose anything for the coming year and that subsequently, it would depend on levels of socio-economic disadvantage. I am not in the business of penalising schools which have done well and which continue to have a considerable level of disadvantage. Obviously, I wish to ensure that children receive the supports they need and this matter will be closely examined in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Schools need not feel they have lost status. No school has done so, although some may not have moved into this new co-ordinated programme. We have all the information provided by the schools and, depending on the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the future, we will ensure that supports are maintained for such schools.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>On foot of the Minister&rsquo;s comments, may I take it that schools which have home-school-community liaison co-ordinators will not lose them, at least for the coming year, even if they are not in DEIS?</P>
    <P>I have examined the indicators which were used for the primary schools. Does the Minister consider that some might discriminate against some small rural schools? In such schools, one is more likely to encounter under-employment, with small farmers, than unemployment and one will have smaller numbers of people in local authority housing. Moreover, given the location of rural schools in particular, children who want to engage in activities such as swimming must often <Col N="783"/>travel for 20 km to 40 km, etc. This takes resource and so on and they will be disadvantaged as a result.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not answer one of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions regarding new schools. A mechanism exists whereby new schools can be included in the scheme. All schools have been told that they will lose nothing in the coming year. Thereafter, it will be decided in terms of their levels of socio-economic disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Department chose to operate distinct urban and rural schemes for the reasons outlined by the Deputy. Different circumstances exist in respect of rural areas. Hence, such schools have their own category and compete against one another and not against urban schools. The Department recognises their differences. Different elements of the scheme apply to rural schools, because one might have a number of small rural schools which did not merit extra staff in themselves, but which had a shared co-ordinator and shared facilities, etc. Another question was asked in respect of County Mayo and it is interesting to note that 20% the schools in the rural element of the scheme come from that county.</P>

	<P>The national youth work development plan, which was published in 2003, identifies four main goals for the development of youth work in Ireland and proposes 50 action points to achieve these goals over a five-year period.</P>
    <P>My Department has been actively engaged in consultations with the national youth work advisory committee regarding the prioritised implementation of the plan. Based on these consultations, my Department identified a number of priority action areas for implementation and I am happy to report that progress has been made in a number of important areas.</P>
    <P>As recommended in the plan, my Department has targeted the development and expansion of the special projects for youth scheme which supports some of the most marginalised and vulnerable young people. To date, the number of projects supported by my Department has increased from 164 in 2003 to the current level of 177. In addition, 32 single worker projects have been upgraded to two worker projects.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has also been made in the area of child protection training for the youth work sector. A national child protection unit, which is based within the National Youth Council <Col N="784"/>of Ireland and supported by me and the Department, has led and co-ordinated child protection training initiatives and assisted many youth organisations with the drafting of child protection policies and guidelines. In recent months my Department has worked with the unit and the central Garda vetting unit to agree a process for the Garda vetting of new youth work staff and volunteers. This process is due to commence in September 2006 and is a most welcome development for all involved in youth work as it will be an added safeguard in ensuring the safety of the young people involved in youth work activities.</P>
    <P>As proposed in the plan, a committee for the professional endorsement of youth work training has been established on a North-South basis. In the first instance, the role of the education and training standards committee for youth work, which was set up following agreement between the relevant parties in both jurisdictions, is the professional endorsement of courses, programmes of education and training in youth work provided by higher education institutions in Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <P>Two major reviews are recommended in the plan. A review of youth information provision and a review of funding of the youth work sector have been commenced and are near completion.</P>
    <P>In 2005, I established a development fund for youth work organisations to prepare themselves organisationally for the roll-out of the Youth Work Act 2001. More than &euro;300,000 was provided for this fund in 2005 and I will make similar funding available to national and major voluntary youth work organisations in 2006. In this regard, my Department is engaged in discussions with the various youth work interests regarding further priority areas for development for 2006.</P>
    <P>A structure for the resourcing of vocational education committees to carry out their functions under the terms of the Youth Work Act 2001 has now been agreed, in principle, between me and the Irish Vocational Education Association.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Work is also under way on the establishment of a national youth work development unit at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. This unit will spearhead youth research and development in Ireland. This is an especially important development in the context of the plan because 18 of its actions are in some way linked to such a unit being set up. I am confident the establishment of this unit will pave the way for the implementation of further actions recommended in the plan.</P>
    <P>I also expect to have a youth work assessor appointed soon. Further action areas for development in 2006 and 2007 are being considered by my Department with advice from the national youth work advisory committee. Significant progress has been made and I intend to build further on this work in 2006.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. While she stated she is satisfied with <Col N="785"/>progress, this answer is almost identical to that given this time last year and I do not consider that to constitute progress. I am disappointed to tell her this, but I have last year&rsquo;s reply to hand. The only difference relates to the establishment of a development fund for youth work organisations. A sum of &euro;300,000 was allocated for this purpose last year and there is talk of allocating the same amount this year.</P>
    <P>I find this disappointing. While I do not know who is to blame for this, youth work and young people are being neglected. After years in preparation, this development plan was supposed to be the mechanism which would provide the money. Members were told it would cost approximately &euro;37 million, to be divided over five years. However, nothing approaching that sum has been spent. Youth services need money and young people need money.</P>

Will she provide me with a rough idea of this year&rsquo;s plans? I accept there will probably be some announcements in the coming weeks. What areas does the Minister of State hope to fund and how much money does she expect to spend? Given that we are now more than two years into the plan, what is the status of the commitment of resources, originally supposed to be &euro;40 million? Young people need our help. They are under considerable pressure and there are many social problems that we are not fully addressing. We need to treat the matter with more urgency.</P>

	<P>I disagree with the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that not much was done in the past year. The Youth Work Act and the development plan have been worked on in consultation with those involved in youth work. NYWAC is established to advise the Minister of the day. Priorities in rolling out this work are discussed through that body. The consultations with NYWAC have highlighted areas such as the targets, development and expansion of special projects for youth schemes, which have increased each year. Child protection is of extreme importance and we have supported the NYCI in this regard.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <P>The committee of professional endorsement of youth work is another provision, which is extremely important for those working in that area. In January, I launched the endorsement of youth work with my counterpart in the North. It is most important that this endorsement procedure should exist rather than needing to look to other places such as Wales and England for such endorsement. The development fund was <Col N="786"/>also established, which is very important. Some &euro;300,000 was given to this fund in 2005 and the funding for 2006 will be similar. This decision will not be taken in isolation by me and the Department. It will be taken in consultation with youth work interests, which is how we have proceeded all along.</P>
    <P>New structures have been agreed with the IVEA to include a number of youth workers throughout the country through the VEC system. The national youth work development unit was established in NUI Maynooth. Dr. Maurice Devlin will work in that important research unit and we will rely on such skill, knowledge and expertise. The unit will have a very positive knock-on effect for a further 18 actions of the plan. The youth assessor position was advertised in December and we will be in a position to announce the successful candidate very soon.</P>

	<P>How much money has been spent on this area? We were promised that &euro;40 million would be spent over a five-year period.

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if she will introduce driver education into the school curriculum and make it widely available to young people; if she will have discussions with the Department of Transport to devise specific measures to educate young people regarding safe behaviour on the road; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20109/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to introduce driver education, in the form of driving lessons, in schools, and this is not the norm within the EU. As the Deputy will be aware, a report produced for the NCCA by an expert group which included representatives of the National Safety Council, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Insurance Federation, and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry indicated that the research available internationally was inconclusive on the benefits of teaching young people to drive at school. Particular issues highlighted include the gap arising between the time practical skills are learned initially and put into regular practice, and the risks arising from more young people taking up driving at an earlier age.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads. The social personal and health education programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme and this provides a vehicle through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.</P>
    <P>Specific materials for teaching young people about road safety have also been given to schools. At the start of the 2001-02 school year the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive &mdash; a road safety resource for transition year and the senior cycle &mdash; to all second level schools. This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as per<Col N="788"/>sonal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users. A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack along with copies of the Rules of the Road. In the preparation of the Staying Alive resources material, views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety. Prior to its issue to second level schools, the material was piloted in 20 schools and the response from teachers in those schools was very positive. This is also supplemented by Garda visits to primary and second level schools during which the themes of crime, road safety, personal safety and substance abuse are explored as part of the SPHE programme. There were some 1,900 school visits in 2005.</P>
    <P>Not only is there a curricular framework in place already in which the importance of road safety can be taught to our young people, but this is also supplemented by specific teaching materials and by a comprehensive programme of Garda visits to schools.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The issue of how road safety education can be further strengthened in our schools in an age appropriate way is being examined by the Cabinet sub-committee on road safety, of which I am a member.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>While the measures in place are good, by and large they are only implemented in the junior cycle. Has consideration been given to the proposal of the safe driving pledge organisation to have a comprehensive programme in all schools at senior cycle level, probably during transition year? Is the Minister aware that surveys indicate that both young people and 98% of parents would favour such driver education in schools? I am not talking about students learning to drive involving cars but rather simulated activity in a controlled environment in schools. They should be broadly educated about motivation, knowledge and attitude while driving cars. I am sure the Minister is aware that tragically young people are over-represented in the appalling carnage on our roads.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Tragically it is mostly young people who are involved in the accidents taking place. Obviously we should aim to encourage anything that schools can do to support young people in learning about responsibility, self-protection and care. I also see great potential within the transition year, with perhaps a structured modularised programme covering the rules of the road. Simulated driving experience may not be possible as the equipment can be very expensive. Values, respect and responsibility are just as important in this regard. We should not lightly cast away age appropriate behaviour. The role of SPHE is important in this regard, starting from a very early age with the child walking on the street <Col N="789"/>or crossing the road and building up to being the passenger in a car and the responsibilities that passengers have for their own protection. In one tragic accident recently some young people were killed. However, three other young people had refused to get into the car. They took responsibility for at least their own lives. There is much we can do in this regard.</P>
    <P>I accept that some parents maintain that this should all be taught in school. However, those same parents are buying cars for their 17 year old children. They would be far better employed putting the money into driving lessons before buying the car. There seems to be a lack of balance between the expenditure and the accompanying responsibility. It behoves all of us to do this. My one difficulty with transition year is that not all schools offer the option. However, the SPHE programme at senior level is now being devised by the curriculum council, which will include an extension of the programme up to junior cycle. It can be tackled in a broader curricular way but I would like it to be more structured in transition year. A great deal of research demonstrates that young people do not apply what they learn at school when they leave. They have a positive attitude about responsibility on the road, yet, in a survey in 2001, they also said it was safe to speed in certain circumstances. One must consider their age before striking a balance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all the more reason simulated driving modules should be provided.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am supportive of promoting the respect and responsibility of young drivers for themselves and others in transition year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Research highlights that, unfortunately, separating respect and responsibility from driving experience is not straightforward. While young people acknowledge the need for respect and responsibility, when they get behind the wheel of a car, their behaviour is different. That is why in other countries where simulators are used in schools, young people learn about and appreciate appropriate driving behaviour when they are behind the wheel and that makes the difference.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fair point to ensure the theory matches the practice. The difficulty is how to do that, especially where a driving course is taught to a 15 year old in transition year who must wait two years before he or she can get behind the wheel of a car. I am anxious to do whatever I can within the education system to support the work of other Departments to protect young people. I am investigating whether that should involve teaching them the rules of the road or providing a computer-based programme.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if she has ensured that a representative from the Dublin Institute of Technology students&rsquo; union will have a seat on the Grangegorman Development Agency.</Quest>
     <QRef>[19952/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The relocation of DIT, which is spread over 30 different sites in Dublin, to a 65-acre campus in Grangegorman is a major priority for the Government. The move will enable the institute to provide better academic and support services for its nearly 20,000 students. It will also allow for much greater academic and social interaction between students of many different disciplines, providing a dynamic environment for a broad third level education in the heart of Dublin city centre. It also has great potential to regenerate an underdeveloped area of the north inner city. I recently announced the appointment of Mr. John Fitzgerald, city manager of Dublin City Council, as chairman of the Grangegorman Development Agency and I am considering the other appointments to the agency.</P>
    <P>The general aim is to oversee the development of the lands at Grangegorman on behalf of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Health Service Executive. The Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005 provides for a total membership of 15 in the agency, including the chairperson and chief executive officer. There is no specific provision for a student or staff representative from the DIT. The legislation provides that two ordinary members of the agency will be nominated by the president of DIT and it is clearly a matter for the president to determine who to nominate having regard to the functions of the agency set out in the Act and its governance role in the development. The legislation recognises the student body of DIT specifically among the stakeholders that should be represented on the consultative group provided for in section 22 of the Act. Up to two members of the consultative group can come from the student body.</P>
    <P>My officials recently met the president of DIT students&rsquo; union and explained how the consultative group will give the stakeholders an opportunity to outline their views and participate fully in the Grangegorman development. The Act also provides for the consultative group to hold as many meetings as may be necessary to maintain an adequate communications strategy concerning the development of the Grangegorman site. The consultative group reports to the chairperson of the agency.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does this mean that a representative of the students' union will be appointed to the agency by the Minister? Can she make such an appointment given that six appointments are outstanding? I accept the agency&rsquo;s role is to oversee the lands and so on and I accept two ordinary members, including my party colleague, Mr. Christy Burke, are on the consultative group. Is there a compelling reason for the exclusion of a representative of the students&rsquo; union on the agency? The agency should be inclusive and, given that more than 21,000 students will attend the institute, I hope the Minister will consider the appointment of a student representative. The other agencies and stakeholders will be represented and it would be positive if the students&rsquo; union were involved in the early work of the agency. While I accept the students are represented on the consultative group, perhaps the Minister will consider the appointment of a representative of the student body to the agency.</P>

They must reflect all interests, including my own and the Department&rsquo;s. I must wait to see who is nominated by the other bodies before I can determine my appointments.</P>

<asker>Mr. McHugh</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if her Department will re-evaluate the new DEIS programme in view of the fact that a large number of County Mayo schools in disadvantaged areas will lose out owing to this new programme; her views on whether the children affected cannot afford this educational loss; when the results of the review mechanism, as previously mentioned by her, will be available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[19821/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>No school has been informed it will lose the resources it has received under existing schemes for tackling disadvantage as a result of the introduction of the new delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, initiative. The new school support programme is aimed at providing even more resources for the most disadvantaged schools. Schools that did not qualify for the new programme will keep the additional resources they are getting under existing schemes for the 2006-07 school year and, after <Col N="792"/>that, they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
    <P>The new DEIS programme will be of huge benefit to schools in County Mayo. Four urban-town primary schools, 59 rural primary schools and six second level schools in Mayo have been invited to benefit from all the resources available from the new programme. Almost 20% of all the rural schools invited to benefit from the new programme nationally are in Mayo. It is important to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities get all the additional support possible and will welcome the extra resources DEIS will provide for Mayo schools.</P>
    <P>DEIS was designed with this goal in mind. For example, over the years, no fewer than eight separate schemes for disadvantaged primary schools have been put in place. Some schools were benefiting from just one or two of these and others were benefiting from more. The DEIS initiative is designed to ensure the most disadvantaged schools benefit from a comprehensive package of supports, while ensuring others continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy there is no reason for schools that have not been identified for the new programme to be concerned as they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils. No school in Mayo or any other county has been informed it will lose any resources as a result of DEIS. A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage to warrant their inclusion in the programme. This mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person charged with ensuring all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. It is intended that the review process will be completed by the end of the current school year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply. IDA Ireland announced earlier that job creation in County Mayo fell again last year and, therefore, the county is in a bad way. Crossmolina national school has not been included under the school support programme. This school opened in 2002 and the teachers have done wonderful work under the various programmes. However, since then, the catchment area has been affected by job losses at Bellacorick power station, Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB, Hennigans and Oasis in Ballina and Volex in Castlebar. The Bank of Ireland recently closed its branch in the town and four shops have closed as a result of the job losses. No new jobs have been created in the area since the school opened.</P><Col N="793"/>
    <P>The school authorities cannot understand why the school has not been included in the programme. I acknowledge that no school has been informed it will lose resources but no commitment has been given that the school will not lose resources. The home-school-community liaison co-ordinator has been of great benefit to the school and I ask the Minister to consider this post, in particular. No funding is guaranteed after 2007 and the pupils could be left hanging. However, there is a concern about the assessment process, although a questionnaire was filled out.</P>
    <P>In a place like Crossmolina, employment is temporary, such as the McAlpine operation for the ESB. There are no local authority houses in the area, although there should be, but just people in poor private rented accommodation, so the assessment process is questionable. When will this review process take place again and a school that has lost out be catered for? The reason Mayo accounts for 20% of rural national schools invited to benefit from the programme, is that Mayo is so badly off taking into account the BMW under spending of &euro;4.65 billion and the transport under spending of &euro;500 million. Therefore, it is not surprising that Mayo has more schools in the new programme. However, schools in Crossmolina, Lahardane, Currane, Tonragee are in an area where there has not been any job creation and where the situation has got worse rather than better. When the temporary employment in Crossmolina goes, what is the future for the area, when the assessment process depends on the pupil rather than the school?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Not only were schools not told that they would not lose, they were specifically told in a letter written to every school that participated that there would be no loss in 2006-07. I am surprised to hear that a school is questioning the survey because it was the schools that provided the information. The survey was independently based and assessed and spot-checked to ensure that the information was accurate. The schools provided the information and it was judged on very significant variables, namely, the percentage of unemployed, local authority accommodation, lone parents, Travellers, large families of five or more children, as well as the percentage of pupils eligible for free books. Each of these variables has an impact on educational outcome.</P>
    <P>Mayo has a thriving economy and has received much investment from the Government over the years. It has the second highest participation rate in third level education in Ireland. It is not educationally disadvantaged and the schools that deserve it most in Mayo are getting it. The schools that have applied to be reviewed are currently being reviewed and they will be notified before the end of the school year.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="794"/>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Half of our graduates must go to Dublin to get their first job. These are transient jobs, so the unemployment rate is skewed.

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister listed the criteria involved, but she did not mention the retention rate, although that is one of the criteria for disadvantaged status. It seems unfair that the school works hard to keep the children in the school yet that will be held as an indicator that the school is not as disadvantaged as other primary indicators would suggest. Is the retention rate one of the criteria for disadvantaged status?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The variables listed are those for the primary school. The variables for second level schools are as follows: medical card data for junior certificate candidates; junior certificate retention rates by schools; junior certificate examination results aggregated by school level, based on the student&rsquo;s performance in the seven subjects in which he or she performed best; as well as leaving certificate retention rates by schools. These are the best indicators of the disadvantaged level in a school. There are fewer schools at second level that are looking for a review than at primary level. Some schools are managing to hold on to pupils and feel that they should not be penalised, but there are also schools that are not doing so and that are seriously disadvantaged. We must target these schools first. Schools will continue to receive a level of support in line with the level of socio-economic disadvantage that exists in the schools.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>If schools meet all the other criteria, then that one issue should not prevent them from obtaining disadvantaged status. It discourages schools from retaining their pupils.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the problems with disadvantaged schools is the drop-out rate. Retention would indicate that there is a low drop-out rate.</P>

	<P>If they are succeeding, they should not be punished.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister stating categorically that disadvantaged schools will not lose resources?</P><Col N="795"/>
    <P>Is rural disadvantage widespread? How does it compare to urban disadvantage? Do the rural schools miss out on disadvantaged status because they are not disadvantaged compared with urban areas? Will the Minister ensure that all projects dealing with education and particularly primary education are prioritised? Any society should prioritise education as of major importance and funding should always be available for education as it is a way out of poverty for the most disadvantaged people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Every school that participated in the survey was informed in writing that no school would lose any current resources for 2006-07. The schools were also informed that beyond that they would receive resources in line with the level of socio-economic disadvantage in each school.</P>
    <P>Rural schools are not compared with urban schools as there is separate category for the rural schools. There is a big difference between rural and urban disadvantage. Where there is a greater concentration of poverty and educational disadvantage in urban areas, then there is a greater level of disadvantage in the schools. That will be targeted in this project.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>about the effort being made to improve pupil-teacher ratios with particular reference to the specific needs in areas having higher than average ratios; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20029/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at both primary and post-primary level in recent years. Next September there will be 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, when compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, when resource teachers and so on are included. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. With the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by the Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years, more teachers will be put in place for the priority areas of disadvantage and special education and under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
    <P>Primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that, and in some cases there are two teachers for just 12 pupils. That will be reduced to 28 children per classroom <Col N="796"/>teacher this September and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>An initiative of direct benefit to primary schools in Kildare has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year, the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools in Kildare. For the 2005-06 school year, 170 such posts were sanctioned, compared to 105 in 2004-05.</P>
    <P>Major progress has also been made at second level. The pupil-teacher ratio at second level has been reduced from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.4:1 in the 2004-05 school year. This reduction has been achieved through the creation of almost 1,800 posts and the retention of more than 2,000 posts that would otherwise have been lost due to falling enrolments. The Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that the average pupil-teacher ratio gives a misleading picture of a particular situation in some schools? Some schools have a pupil-teacher ratio well ahead of the average and if they were excluded from the creation of the average, then the examination and assessment would be skewed. Can she indicate the schools, not only in County Kildare but throughout the country, which are currently ahead of the national average and whether teachers, students and the standard of education are suffering? A reduction in class size of one child in each of the next two years is hardly a major onslaught on an element of education which is fundamental to students&rsquo; future well-being. Is the Minister aware that teaching unions have expressed concerns about this issue, with particular reference to schools with a higher than average pupil-teacher ratio?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the claim that the quality of education or teaching has disimproved. Students are certainly not suffering in that regard. There is no doubt that the 4,000 extra teachers employed in the system could have been deployed to reduce class size but the Government chose to prioritise children with special needs, who had been forgotten for many years, and disadvantaged schools. That is why, under projects like DEIS, pupil-teacher ratios are 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes in the most disadvantaged schools. Nobody could argue with that.</P>
    <P>Some 5,000 teachers have been employed to work with children with learning difficulties or special needs. Formerly, these children were not included in our schools and were the first to drop out, so they had to be targeted. There is a tend<Col N="797"/>ency on the part of classroom teachers to ignore these extra staff, even though classroom teachers also benefit when children receive extra support from resource and learning support teachers.</P>
    <P>Having addressed these priorities, we have now given a commitment to reduce class sizes over the next two years. I am unable to give a commitment beyond that.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister aware of the schools in County Kildare which currently have an above average pupil-teacher ratio? This problem has existed for the past several years and will probably remain for a number of years to come unless urgent action is taken.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>While I cannot treat County Kildare any differently to the rest of the country, that county and other developing areas have special status and will receive allocations based on a pupil-teacher ratio of 28:1 from September. We envisage that a further 500 teaching posts will be created next September because of enrolment increases and schedule changes. That increase will make a significant difference to class sizes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The public representatives of County Kildare were invited to visit some classrooms in order to understand why overcrowding will make the new curriculum impossible to teach. Does the Minister accept the influence this issue will have on the educational outcome of the children concerned? Schools face space problems alongside the challenge of pupil-teacher ratios.</P>
    <P Just="Left">If local authority housing is used as a criterion for disadvantage, are people on housing waiting lists or in private rented accommodation being included? They are often forced to move repeatedly, which is not in the interest of children. For financial reasons, local authority housing lists would seem obvious criteria.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards disadvantage, each school provided and interpreted its respective information. Questions on local authority housing were asked and some schools may have included local authority housing waiting lists because they were familiar with the particular circumstances of their students.</P>
    <P>In the coming school year, there will be no justification for classes of 33 or 34 students where a staff allocation has been made on a pupil-teacher ratio of 28:1.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Theoretically, there should be no justification but such is the reality. Has the Minister any way of responding to the challenges faced by schools in areas with huge demand for places? The parents in these areas want their children to attend local schools but classrooms are too small to accommodate them. Is an emergency response possible for these areas? For the sake of <Col N="798"/>the children concerned, the Department needs to move more quickly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A decision by a school to pack in more children is not sufficient reason for the Department to allocate an extra teacher.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>They have nowhere else to go.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Schools are aware of their allocation and the physical space available to them. If it is a question of physical space, &euro;500 million is being spent on school buildings this year and, through the permanent initiative, schools can build extra classrooms. Teachers have to be allocated fairly and objectively and we are prioritising developing and disadvantaged schools and special needs students. By September 2007, there will be nearly 4,500 more primary school teachers in our schools than when this Government came to power. That is making a real difference to children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Extra teachers are not the only answer because extra space is also needed. When the Minister is working out her priorities for the next couple of years, will she treat the greater Dublin region differently to the rest of the country? She should look at the average figure for that region because it contains the schools under the greatest pressure. If they are as good as she claims, I will accept that but counties Kildare, Meath, Louth and Wicklow need urgent support. In respect of class sizes, some children in County Meath have to leave their school buildings to attend classes in houses across the road.</P>

     <Quest>if officials in her Department have had discussions with the officials in the Department of Transport with regard to carrying out an independent audit of all public and private <Col N="799"/>school buses, in view of the continuing safety concerns that exist.</Quest>

	<P>An independent review requested by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, is currently being carried out within Bus &Eacute;ireann. This review will look at the arrangements and systems in place for the management, operation and maintenance of the fleet of buses owned and contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann to ensure ongoing safety and roadworthiness. My officials will liaise with the Department of Transport regarding the outcome of the review.</P>
    <P>Regular discussions are held between officials in the two Departments on matters pertaining to school transport operations. These discussions focus on such matters as seating and seat belt installations on school buses. Arising from contacts involving the two Departments, it was possible last year to announce a package of measures designed to enhance the safety of school transport operations. These measures include the phasing out of three-for-two seating arrangements and the installation of seat belts on all school buses. Arrangements are in hand to have these measures in place by the end of this year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. If she has any further light to shed on the issue, I would appreciate a description of the nature of the discussions which have taken place, given that a number of fatal and non-fatal accidents have occurred over the past year. I would like to be assured that a dialogue is taking place between the two Departments. I need to know, for example, that the Minister is fighting vociferously for a more stringent system of testing for school buses in particular, given the demographic and the youth of the children being carried by the buses. I have seen responses by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, on the independent review being carried within Bus &Eacute;ireann on the management, operation and maintenance of its own and contract buses. Will this review be general for all buses or will there be a separate review for school buses? If so, what additional areas will be examined?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>The responsibility for legislation on safety is with the Department of Transport. That is why the Department of Education and Science is in constant touch with the Department of Transport regarding school transport. In my initial reply I named two issues that we have discussed at length with the Department of Transport, namely the phasing out of three seats for two and the question of the installation of seat belts. That has been ongoing. I also referred to the independent review in Bus &Eacute;ireann, to which the Deputy referred, and which is being carried on the instruction of the Minister for Transport.</P><Col N="800"/>
    <P>Separately, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, has requested the chief executive designate of the proposed road safety authority to undertake a fundamental review of the arrangements for compulsory, periodic roadworthiness tests of goods vehicles and buses, so it is a wider issue. As part of that review, the matter of Bus &Eacute;ireann undertaking such roadworthiness tests on its own vehicles will be examined.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>What is special for school buses?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, the situation is being reviewed independently within Bus &Eacute;ireann. This review was instigated by the Minister last Tuesday. He has asked Bus &Eacute;ireann to look at the management systems and operation and maintenance of school buses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>So it is on buses in general.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but in this context there is a specific reference to the school transport scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s upgrade aims are still on target for December this year. Can she, in her discussions with the Department of Transport, reinforce that we want a higher standard for our children and demand that we get the best, not just what passes the tests? The system of reviewing and issuing certificates must be checked as a matter of urgency. Surely it is a given that every school bus should have a fire extinguisher. Can the Department of Education and Science issue a set of rules that go beyond what is in place and pre-empt what might result from the court case on last year&rsquo;s Navan bus crash? That might lead us a certain way and set out better examples. Can the Minister of State pre-empt that and set out certain rules and standards, the least being that the bus driver is told what is on the bus to protect young people and required to check it every few days, separate to any certificate of roadworthiness?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the bus driver have overall responsibility for safety on the bus and is the decision with him or her or with the area depot manager? One hears stories about drivers being pressurised to drive buses to areas where they are uncomfortable or when they know there are faults. Is the Minister of State aware of any children being left behind owing to the new changes in regulation? If so, are there any proposals to increase the numbers of buses in those areas?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Might it not have been a good idea to accelerate the programme for reviewing the quality and safety of all buses associated with the school transport system immediately following the tragic accidents that took place?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="801"/>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>The phasing out of the three children for two seats rule will mean one seat per person with a seat belt. We have always believed that the pursuit of those two issues is important. Work had been ongoing before the tragic accident in Navan on both those issues. The one for one seating means we will have to find an extra 3,500 seats to provide every eligible child with his or her own seat and seat belt. We all wish to see the highest possible standards and would all work to those standards. The standards are set by the Department of Transport and we in the Department of Education and Science wish that those standards be followed to the highest possible level.</P>
    <P>People feel strongly about seat belts, which would lead to a safer regime in the buses. That is why we have gone one step further than the directive, which came into law this month and says seat belts must be worn in all buses that have them. We wanted to go far beyond that to ensure that seat belts would be provided for each seat and each child. That underlines the importance my Department places on the allocation of a seat belt for each child. I do not wish to comment on any particular accident because there are ongoing Garda and other investigations which must be allowed to continue without any influence. As far as I am aware, there must be fire extinguishers on buses.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter. This is a sad story of neglect and the failure by the Government to give a sewerage scheme to Achill Sound. This has gone on since 1991. Although that project was supposed to have been introduced 15 years ago, not a spade has been put in the ground. That is a disgrace. I wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle <Col N="802"/>could experience the colour of the sand and the smell. Raw sewage goes out to a sheltered bay. It is a disgrace that this can happen today. Where is the EU responsibility of Government to deliver on this issue and build a treatment plant?</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that the polluter pays principle is now kicking in for a scheme that should have been put in place in 1991. As a result of this principle, the community is being asked for a contribution it cannot give. This community is treated as if it were on O&rsquo;Connell Street with lots of footfall, enterprise and business. However, because the community has been neglected, there is no potential to satisfy the contribution required under the polluter pays principle. The principle has dealt a fatal blow to any chance of stopping this raw sewage from going into Achill Sound. I have asked about this before. Some sort of hardship clause must be invoked. There is provision for such a clause. Will the Minister examine this? The polluter pays principle works for an area that has the economic potential to repay through housing levies and water charges on commercial premises. The Government is playing a blame game even though the Council has made some effort. A scheme worth &euro;8.9 million was approved and sanctioned in June 2005 and went out to tender. A massive local contribution of at least &euro;4.5 million was required but could not be paid. As a result, the Department asked that the scheme be reduced so that the local contribution would be smaller.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been downgraded to cater for a population of 1,200 instead of the original 2,000. Some areas, such as houses on the Mulranney road and Bull&rsquo;s Mouth road, have been removed from the scheme. This change has reduced the cost to some &euro;6.3 million. However, the council maintains that its contribution should be 19% while the Department suggests 38% is required. This is calculated on the basis of an area that has pipes and a collection system. Achill Sound is unique in that it has no treatment system because it has been grossly neglected. At the price of &euro;6.3 million the Department wants Mayo County Council to pay &euro;2.4 million marginal cost, equivalent to 38%. The local contribution should be &euro;1.2 million or 19%.</P>
    <P>Today we heard the IDA has failed miserably to create jobs in Mayo. I ask the Minister of State to address this urgently.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The national water services pricing policy framework provides for the recovery by sanitary authorities of the cost of providing water services from the users of those services, with the exception of water services provided to householders for domestic purposes. This policy is consistent with the polluter pays principle and the EU water framework directive. The policy <Col N="803"/>fully respects the prohibition on charging for domestic water services as provided under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997. It also requires full recovery of the cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector by means of a meter-based volumetric charge and the metering of this sector.</P>
    <P>The major part of the capital cost element of water services schemes relates to domestic water services and is funded by my Department through the water services investment programme. The marginal capital costs are recovered from non-domestic users on a consolidated countywide basis over a period of up to 20 years. A fair and transparent mechanism is used in determining the appropriate level of non-domestic capital costs to be applied to water services projects, including sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>This is identified by sanitary authorities on a scheme-by-scheme basis with the methodology used and the resultant outcome closely monitored by my Department to ensure equity in the application of the policy. My Department has worked very closely with sanitary authorities in developing the charging mechanism and the conditions that apply to pricing policy. A mechanism for the calculation of charges that includes operational, marginal capital and administrative costs has been developed and rolled out to authorities. The unit cost of water services will invariably differ between sanitary authorities given the differences in the costs of water services provision across different local authority areas.</P>
    <P>The Achill Sound sewerage scheme referred to by the Deputy has been approved for construction under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-07. In common with all projects funded under the programme, this scheme must be progressed consistently with the water services pricing policy. Local authorities must ensure the design and scale of individual schemes takes account of the implications of the pricing policy framework. This involves my Department funding the capital costs associated with the provision of services to meet the requirements of the existing domestic population together with a contribution of up to 40% for serving the additional future domestic population.</P>

	<P>The remaining marginal capital cost of servicing non-domestic consumers and providing for future development is recovered by the local authority from all non-domestic consumers in its functional area on a countywide basis through a combination of water charges on commercial consumers and planning levies on future development.</P><Col N="804"/>
    <P>Only significant largescale consumers who reserve a specific proportion of the overall capacity of a scheme are required to make a direct up-front contribution to the capital costs. I understand it is unlikely there are any such consumers in this case. My Department has advised Mayo County Council of aspects of the council&rsquo;s proposals that need to be reviewed to allow the appropriate non-domestic capital contribution to be determined. My Department has previously approved the council&rsquo;s tender recommendation for the scheme and the council is currently reviewing the scheme with a view to reducing the overall cost to a more economic level.</P>

	<P>Mount Olive Road, Swan&rsquo;s Nest Road, Mount Olive Grove and Swan&rsquo;s Nest Avenue are pleasant residential streets in St. Benedict&rsquo;s parish, Kilbarrack, in the heart of my constituency, Dublin North-East. The 400 houses in the area lie between Kilbarrack Road and Kilbarrack shopping centre. Besides the small pocket park behind the shopping centre, the residents have only one small open space of approximately three acres. For over seven years my colleague, Councillor Anne Carter, and I have campaigned to have Mount Olive-Swan&rsquo;s Nest open space upgraded to a full city park with plinth walls, a decorative railing, improved surface for the football pitch and a new seven-a-side pitch for the children of Kilbarrack. About six months ago I was approached by the committee of Kilmount Football Club, which uses the pitch, requesting urgent support for the upgrading of the green area and the provision of dressing rooms nearby. The Kilmount Football Club committee outlined an ambitious programme to develop the club with under age children&rsquo;s teams and a seven-a-side facility. I arranged for the deputy area manager of Dublin City Council to meet the committee last February.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Kilmount Football Club has provided recreation for the children and youth of the Kilbarrack parish for over 30 years at this location. The pitch is also made available to the local secondary school, Ard Scoil La Salle, which plays all home matches there and has won Leinster and all-Ireland soccer titles in the course of its outstanding academic and sports history. Last week the Mount Olive-Swan&rsquo;s Nest community was stunned to learn that Dublin City Council has <Col N="805"/>prepared a report for the north central area committee proposing a waste management centre for a large corner section of the Mount Olive-Swan&rsquo;s Nest park. Instead of being offered a high-quality, refurbished small city park, my constituents are being threatened with a busy regional bring centre that will devastate the area with additional heavy traffic, remove a significant part of the amenity, leave an eyesore high wall structure for youths to hang around and produce unknown environmental effects given the range of waste accepted. The bring centre will open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. seven days per week, including bank holidays. There is no doubt that a huge and constant stream of cars will greatly increase traffic on the already busy Swan's Nest road and avenue and Mount Olive road. It is also likely that much additional traffic will be attracted to rat-run through the adjoining 400 houses of the Grangepark estate and the over 500 houses of the Woodbine and Millwood estates in Raheny, while Raheny road, a key artery of my constituency that already has heavy traffic, will be completely clogged. The 2.4 m walls, sliding roller gates and gatehouse, highlighting poles, huge waste receptacles and 20 sq. m compactors are typical of an industrial project and have no place in a much loved area of a quiet residential estate.</P>
  
    <P Just="Left">Residents also have grave concerns regarding the wide range of waste products to be deposited at the location which includes, besides glass, plastic, aluminium, steel and cardboard by-products, wood and garden waste, and especially hazardous waste including waste oil, car batteries, paints and so on. On a walkabout of Mount Olive-Swan's Nest estate last week, I found residents appalled and distraught at the prospect of this waste centre being installed at their cherished local green space. They have formed an action committee totally opposed to the proposals and this evening in this House I speak for them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I urged Dublin City Council north central area manager, Mr. Declan Wallace, to abandon the proposed waste centre at that location and put it in an industrial estate, where such a centre truly belongs. Mr. Wallace says that the announcement is simply a pre-consultation stage of the project, but my constituents are unanimous that they do not want that waste centre on their little green in the heart of an older Dublin City Council estate under any circumstances. Instead, they want the green upgraded to full city park status with a plinth wall and railings boundary and improved pitches and facilities for the local Kilmount Football Club.</P>
    <P>I hope Dublin City Council, under the stewardship of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will listen to them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising a matter obviously very much in the interests of his community.</P><Col N="806"/>
    <P>Under the Waste Management Act 1996, as amended, local authorities have a statutory duty to make a waste management plan for the prevention, minimisation, collection, recovery and disposal of non-hazardous waste. Dublin City Council, as the lead authority for the four Dublin local authorities, completed the review of its waste management plan late last year, and a plan is now in place for the period from 2005 to 2010. Local authorities have a statutory duty under section 38 of the Waste Management Act 1996 to provide and operate, or to arrange for the provision and operation of, facilities for recovery and disposal of household waste arising within their functional areas.</P>
    <P>Government policy on waste management, as set out in the policy statement Waste Management &mdash; Changing our Ways, is based on the internationally adopted hierarchy of options that places greater emphasis on waste prevention, followed by minimisation, re-use, energy recovery and finally, the environmentally sustainable disposal of residual waste. We must concentrate, therefore, on more and more recycling facilities to ensure the general public has easy access to a large number of high-quality facilities. Increased levels of recycling will in turn lead to reduced levels of waste going to landfill for final disposal.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by Deputy Broughan are a matter solely for Dublin City Council at official and elected member level, and my Department has no role in the matter. However, I understand from Dublin City Council that the council is proposing to place a manned bring bank facility at Mount Olive Park, Kilbarrack, Dublin 5, which will take up 10% of the open space at the location. The location of the proposed facility is in line with the current waste management plan for the Dublin region, and the particular site in Kilbarrack is listed in the plan.</P>
    <P>The council will require planning approval under Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2003 for this facility. Under section 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, local authorities are exempt from planning permission when they carry out development in their own functional areas. However, Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2003 sets out the procedures for public consultation that must be followed by local authorities where they propose certain classes of development. It is open to any individual to submit comments or observations on the proposed development as part of the planning process.</P>
    <P>In this case, Dublin City Council also intends to consult local residents prior to beginning the planning approval process. The bring bank facility will also require a certificate of registration from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in order to operate. On the designation of the park in question, section 67 &mdash; and Schedule 13 &mdash; of the Local Government Act 2001 empower local authorities to promote the interests of the local community regarding amen<Col N="807"/>ity, recreation and other functions. That includes the provision of parks, gardens, open spaces, playgrounds etc. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the extent to which those facilities should be provided and to allocate resources accordingly.</P>
    <P>Decisions on what should be provided are properly left to local authorities themselves, as <Col N="808"/>they are in the best position to assess the level of need in their area and how best to address it. There will, therefore, be ample opportunities for all interested parties to convey their views to Dublin City Council on the proposal to locate a manned bring bank facility at this location.</P>

    <P>The Adult Literacy service is organised by and delivered through the VEC Adult Literacy Schemes throughout the country. The service is resourced and managed by the VECs through funding from my Department.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Adult Education, &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;, published in 2000, identifies adult literacy as the top priority in adult education.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, funding from my Department for Adult Literacy has incrementally increased from &euro;1million then to &euro;23million in 2006. As a consequence, the numbers of clients catered for annually have increased from 5,000 to over 35,000 in 2005.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 committed &euro;93.5 million and anticipated that 110,000 people would participate in the adult literacy programme over the period. This target has been exceeded.</P>
    <P>Specially targeted literacy programmes, such as family learning programmes, literacy for non-<Col N="810"/>Irish nationals, programmes for people with special needs,for Travellers and for Gaeltacht people, have been provided. Family literacy groups, involving adults and their children, are running successfully. In recognition of the vital role of parents and other family members in children&rsquo;s literacy development, a new family literacy project within DEIS is currently being developed by my Department.</P>
    <P>A new intensive literacy programme has recently been introduced on a pilot basis. This is a joint project led by the Irish Vocational Education Association in partnership with the National Adult Literacy Agency and my Department. It is now on offer to people with severe literacy needs and involves six hours of literacy tuition per week instead of the usual two hours. The programme will be reviewed this summer and a report is expected in the autumn. My Department has provided funding of just over &euro;1million for this pilot programme. The future of the programme will be considered on receipt of the report.</P>
    <P>An assessment framework, known as &ldquo;Mapping the Learning Journey&rdquo; for the adult literacy service, that will be in line with best international practice is in the course of being introduced as a feature of the literacy services of many VECs. It will eventually be available nationwide. The key focus is how to bring national consistency and objective standards into the initial diagnosis of learners&rsquo; starting points and subsequent progress. My Department has provided funding of &euro;167,000 to the &ldquo;Mapping the Learning Journey&rdquo; assessment framework in 2006.</P>
    <P>It should be recognised that these initiatives would take some time to impact on the large target-group of adults with literacy problems, that is 500,000 people. For one reason or another, many people were reluctant to enrol in the public literacy services, even though they knew they had problems. To help these people, my Department commissioned the production of five TV series in literacy awareness and tuition for adults.</P><Col N="811"/>
    <P>For 2006, it is proposed to provide a new two year multi-media literacy tuition initiative. This will be done in partnership with the National Adult Literacy Agency and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and RTE.</P>
    <P>Adult literacy will continue to be my top priority in adult education and I shall continue to extend the literacy service as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the Committee&rsquo;s report in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 13 and 86 together.</P>
    <P>In January 2005 I established the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools. The balancing of rights in Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 was acknowledged by the Task Force as one of the areas which prompted many submissions. While highlighting the fact that the majority of section 29 suspensions and expulsions are going in favour of schools, the Task Force report recommended that the legislation be amended to strike a better balance between the rights of the disruptive student and those of his/her peers to an education. It also recommended that the timeframe involved in these appeals be examined.</P>
    <P>With a view to taking account of these recommendations, the Deputy will be aware that an Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has been included in the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme. This will be a focused piece of legislation the principal purpose of which will be to amend section 29 of the Education Act.</P>
    <P>I believe that all students have the right to learn and every teacher has the right to teach in a positive environment. To this end, immediately after receiving the report of the Task Force, I announced a series of measures to promote positive behaviour in our second level schools, of which amending the legislation is just one.</P><Col N="812"/>
    <P>Other measures include the setting up of a new Behaviour Support Service with four regional teams to work with schools experiencing particular difficulties with discipline.</P>
<P>Staff, including psychologists, are currently being recruited for these teams and they will be in place from the start of the next school year. They will look at every aspect of the school from the type of community it is serving, to the effectiveness of the code of behaviour, the appropriateness of the curriculum and the level of engagement with parents. They will bring with them an awareness of the strategies that have helped schools facing similar challenges to maintain a positive climate.</P>
    <P>The team will be able to identify schools which would benefit from having &rsquo;behaviour support classrooms&rsquo; where students who are seriously misbehaving will be taught in small groups until they are ready to return to the classroom. The emphasis in the special support rooms will be on finding out why students are misbehaving and helping them to change.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Behaviour Support Service, there will also be training for teachers that are having difficulties maintaining good behaviour in their classrooms and an increased availability of alternative programmes to the standard Junior and Leaving Cert exams which are more practical and of more interest to some students than the traditional exam routes. The availability of alternative programmes outside the school system such as Youthreach is also being reviewed.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive package of different measures is needed and that is what we are providing.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I believe that the publication of school inspection reports will go a significant way to addressing the real needs of parents, students, teachers and others for better information on schools. Inspectors&rsquo; reports can identify when schools and teachers are working to optimum effect and where improvements are needed. The reports provide a fair analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of schools in a way that can provide a real indication of school quality.</P>
    <P>When I decided that these reports would be published, I requested that the inspectorate of my Department conduct oral and written consultations with the education partners in relation to the publication process. Twenty-one organisations participated and the consultations were completed in January 2006. Written guidelines <Col N="813"/>were subsequently produced on the publication of inspection reports. I laid the Education Act 1998 (Publication of Inspection Reports on Schools and Centres for Education) Regulations Act before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 31 January 2006.</P>
    <P>As a result of these regulations, all reports arising from WSE inspections commenced on or after 6 February 2006 are subject to publication. Reports arising from inspections commenced prior to that date will not be published by the Department. The procedures provide that the school authorities have an opportunity to verify the facts in the report (period of 10 school days) and the school also has a right of response to the reports (a further 20 school days is allowed for this process). It is intended that both the inspection report and the school response (where this is provided by the school&rsquo;s board of management) will be published simultaneously.</P>
    <P>A timeframe of 14 weeks (70 days excluding school holiday periods) is allowed from the time when the in-school activity is completed and the WSE report is placed on the Department&rsquo;s website. If a school appeals a report the process will take longer.</P>
    <P>The first WSE reports are expected to be ready for publication before the end of June 2006. At present approximately 32 primary WSE reports and 6 post-primary WSE reports are with schools for either factual verification or school response. It is not possible to say precisely when these WSE reports will have completed all stages of the pre-publication process as this is the first time that schools are engaging in a written factual verification process and an optional school response process as part of the evaluation procedure. However, I anticipate that a significant proportion of the reports will be finalised for issue to schools and published on the Department&rsquo;s website before the end of June 2006.</P>
    <P>As the timeframe for the publication of subject inspections is shorter than that for WSE it is expected that a number of subject inspections will be the first reports published and this should occur earlier in June.</P>

	<P>An Inter Departmental Working Group was established in 2002 to examine the <Col N="814"/>issue of extending Garda vetting, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons &mdash; be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placements. My Department was presented on the Working Group.</P>
    <P>In the education sector, vetting is currently available in respect of prospective employees of children in detention schools as well as special needs assistants (SNAs) and bus escorts to children with special needs. My colleague Brian Lenihan TD, Minister for Children, announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the Garda Central Vetting Unit &mdash; which has been relocated to Thurles under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme &mdash; in order to ensure that they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children, whether on a full-time or part-time basis.</P>
    <P>As a first step in the expansion of services provided by the Vetting Unit, it is proposed that new staff employed in the 2006/07 school year will be vetted. In the case of new teachers, vetting will form part of the process of the registration by the newly established Teaching Council. The Council will be responsible for submitting the applications to the Vetting Unit. In the case of non-teaching staff, it will be the responsibility of the relevant school authorities, including vocational education committees where appropriate, to submit the applications.</P>
    <P>Guidelines for school authorities are being prepared and will be issued shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of the establishment of a pre-employment consultancy service, in their report, the Working Group also recommended that the Department of Health and Children and my Department give consideration to the development of non-Garda, employment-related vetting registers to provide information on those previously dismissed, suspended, moved or made redundant from posts for harming children or vulnerable adults in the health and education sectors, respectively.</P>
    <P>Discussions have been held between representatives of both Departments on this matter. In addition, the legal and constitutional issues involved here are being considered by the Department of Health and Children, which has a lead role in advancing this matter, in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board. Under Section 23 of the Act schools are required to have in place a code of behaviour. The Act requires that each Board of Management formulates a code of behaviour in accordance with guidelines from the NEWB.</P>
    <P>The Board, which ensures that children attend school regularly or receive an adequate education, appointed an expert group in November 2005 to draw up a discussion document on the guidelines for schools on developing Codes of Behaviour. This document will form the basis for a widespread consultation process with schools, parents, education partners, organizations working with children, and critically children themselves. The feedback from this consultation phase will inform the final Guidelines. I understand that the Board expects the work will be completed and the guidelines will issue by end of September 2006.</P>
    <P>The Guidelines will focus on how schools can deal progressively and inclusively with behavioural issues, thereby helping to support participation in education for all. Poor behaviour impacts on the learning and teaching environment in a school and valuable class time can be taken up managing it and can also be a barrier to good attendance and participation in school activities.</P>
    <P>The Board welcomes the recommendations of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level which are clearly based on a welfare and inclusive approach to education. In particular, the Board welcomes the recommendations aimed at supporting children in a school setting and the acknowledgement of the need for additional help and support for schools and their students.</P>
    <P>The Guidelines will apply to all schools covered by the Act. They will take account of the work of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level and focus on supporting the process for the development of policy that promotes positive behaviour by students.</P>

	<P>Significant improvements in the levels of direct funding to second level schools have been made in recent years. Since January 2005, the standard per capita grant has been increased by a cumulative &euro;24 per pupil and now stands at &euro;298 per pupil.</P>
    <P>Secondary schools have also benefited under the school services support fund initiative. Introduced with effect from the 2000/01 school year, the school services support grant has been increased since January 2005 by a cumulative &euro;28 per pupil bringing the annual grant from &euro;131 per pupil to &euro;159 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. A secondary school with 500 pupils, for example, now receives annual grants of up to &euro;270,000 towards general expenses and support services. This represents an increase of 83% since 2000.</P>
    <P>Budget allocations for schools in the VEC and C&amp;C sectors are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</P>
    <P>These significant increases in the funding of post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
    <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above <Col N="818"/>priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
    <P Just="Left">All schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>So, as I have pointed out the general rule in the current school year is that at least one classroom teacher is provided for every 29 pupils. Furthermore, the actual average class size nationally is 24.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, some schools do have classes with more than 30 children in them. The number of children in such classes has, however, decreased significantly under this Government. In the 2004/05 school year, the most recent year for which details are available, there were 99,464 children in primary classes of 30-34 inclusive, a significant drop on the 1997 figure. However, what really puts the decrease in large classes under this Government in context is the fact that in 1996/97 five times more children were in classes of 35+ and ten times more children were in classes of 40+.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year.</P>
    <P>Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, I often find that when I look into why a particular school has a class of 35 in a particular grade, the answer is because there is another class in the same school with a much lower than average number of pupils in it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</P><Col N="819"/>
    <P>This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the new School Support was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
    <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the new School Support Programme. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools. I am delighted to say that 833 of the schools invited to join the new School Support Programme have accepted the invitation.</P>
    <P>A review process has been put in place for primary and second-level schools that did not qualify for participation in the School Support Programme and that regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the Programme. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31 March, 2006.</P>
    <P>Details of this review process were notified by letter in early March to: primary schools not selected for inclusion in the SSP and second-level schools, in the Free Education Scheme, not selected for inclusion in the SSP. Over 360 review applications from schools have been received.</P>
    <P>The review process is underway and it is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The review process will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</P><Col N="820"/>
    <P>The review process applies only to those primary schools that participated in the ERC survey in May 2005 and only to those eligible second-level schools for which data were available from the relevant databases.</P>
    <P>Review requests must be evidence-based and based on the variables and reference dates used in the identification process for the SSP. Having completed the process for each school requesting a review, the review group will make a recommendation to my Department in the case of each such school.</P>

	<P>The primary curriculum acknowledges that reading is a complex activity and it stresses that a range of approaches is required to teach children to read successfully.</P>
    <P>The approaches to reading must also be grounded in the children&rsquo;s oral activity and experience. The curriculum, therefore, provides for the use of a range of approaches to facilitate the development of both word identification and comprehension strategies.</P>
    <P>The curriculum recognises the important role that phonological approaches, which include both synthetic and analytic approaches, play in developing children&rsquo;s knowledge of and ability to combine letter sounds in order to identify words. It highlights that in order to be successful these approaches must be used with other strategies such as the development of children&rsquo;s ability to use meaning cues. In addition, children&rsquo;s comprehension skills need to be developed so that they can extract meaning from their reading.</P>
    <P>The importance of using a range of approaches, including phonological approaches, to teach reading was highlighted at in-service seminars delivered to teachers across the country during the roll out of the Primary School Curriculum.</P>
    <P>Teachers are also able to keep abreast of ongoing developments and provision of resources in relation to literacy through membership of such bodies as the National Reading Association, the Irish Learning Support Association and their association with locally based Education Centres.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the implementation of a combination of approaches in our primary schools will enable our children to develop their reading skills so that they can further their learning, critically analyse and respond to their reading material and, above all, read for enjoyment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas including the impact of inward migration and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
    <P>In planning for school provision to meet these demands my Department has adopted an area based approach which involves a public consultation process involving all interested parties. This leads to the production of a blueprint for schools&rsquo; development in an area for a timeframe of approximately ten years. The exercise recently completed on the N4-M4 corridor is an example of this and the rapidly developing areas of north Dublin, south Louth and east Meath will be examined this year. This structured process will ensure a more proactive approach to school planning than had been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>Apart from the area development planning process my Department is also proactively engaged with local authorities on a continual basis in relation to specific areas. This is being done through improved contacts and communication protocols to ensure that the Department is better alerted about new and expanding residential areas and afforded an opportunity to ensure appropriate zoning provision for educational purposes.</P>
    <P>For example in the case of the Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) at Adamstown my Department is working closely with South Dublin County Council and the developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing. Under the SDZ arrangements there is a requirement that schools are in position ahead of or in line with demand, and I think it is one that should be adopted by other planning authorities in relation to major new housing schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department is working particularly closely with Fingal County Council to develop a joint approach to the timely provision of schools in an area of the country subject to extremely rapid development. This work is likely to provide innovative approaches to partnership which I believe can be used to advantage across the country in future.</P>
    <P>My Department prioritises school buildings for rapidly developing areas. This is achieved by <Col N="822"/>assigning them a band one priority rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. Whenever possible, my Department implements a standardised design model or a design and build process to fast track delivery of the buildings themselves. Not alone does this result in speedier delivery of projects but it also achieves savings in design fees and land use arising from the use of the two storey design. Among schools completed using one of these processes is Griffeen Valley in Lucan which was completed in a 13 month timeframe.</P>
    <P>The level of work being done under the schools building programme is at an all-time high. While increased investment is a central reason for this &mdash; &euro;500m this year alone &mdash; radical changes in how projects are planned and managed have also made a major difference in ensuring that provision is delivered in line with or ahead of demand.</P>

	<P>There are approximately 29,000 teachers holding posts of responsibility in our primary and second level schools. This number of promotion posts provides significant promotion opportunities for teachers.</P>
    <P>Posts of Responsibility (PORs) in schools include Principal, Deputy Principal, Assistant Principal and Special Duties Teacher posts. In the case of the posts of Principal and Deputy Principal, the allowances payable are based on the school size and range from &euro;8,662 to &euro;39,513 and from &euro;3,506 to &euro;25,231 respectively. The allowances payable for the Assistant Principal post and Special Duties post are currently &euro;7,927 and &euro;3,506 respectively.</P>
    <P>The filling of promotion posts in schools is primarily a matter for the management authority of each school in accordance with appointment procedures agreed between the managerial authorities, teacher unions and my Department.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in November 2004 I announced funding for the National College of Art and Design (NCAD). The funding was targeted at the refurbishment of the fire station in Thomas Street. This funding was approved on foot of the work by the Kelly Review Group on the prioritisation of capital projects across the third level sector in general. To date, this project has not advanced to construction because the College authorities have been assessing existing provision within the College and exploring alternative options for the future development of the College.</P>
    <P>At the same time my Department was aware that the College authorities were examining accommodation solutions in relation to the totality of the Thomas Street campus in line with the campus development plan that they had developed.</P>
    <P>I understand that An Bord of NCAD recently decided that it wishes to remain at the Thomas Street campus. My Department in association with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) is of course willing to consider the implications of this decision in the context of the original campus development plan or any amendment of it that the college authorities decide to put forward.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, commercial marketing in schools can take a variety of forms &mdash; from educational materials made available to schools by newspapers, to companies offering schemes whereby products are given to the school on the basis of tokens collected by parents.</P>
    <P>It is at the discretion of management in individual schools to decide what commercial initiatives they want their school to engage with. Clearly some initiatives can be of great benefit to schools. However, others might be seen as putting undue pressures on parents to shop in particular stores.</P>
    <P>I recognise the sensitivities attached to the issue of promotion initiatives linking schools, students and parents to commercial activity. However, it would be inappropriate for me to ban all commercial links with schools. I believe that local school management are best placed to ensure that schools only participate in programmes that are appropriate and benefit the school community.</P><Col N="824"/>
    <P>School management should ensure that such schemes do not place undue pressure on parents in terms of requiring additional expenditure, that students are protected from engagement in inappropriate promotional activity and that the schemes are linked to desirable projects serving national educational initiatives.</P>

     <Quest>if she has received a copy of the ASTI survey on special needs 2006; her views on its findings which include widespread delays in securing assessments and resources for children with special needs and lack of training for teachers in this area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At second level, approximately 1,654 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,102 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.</P>
    <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October, 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Depart<Col N="825"/>ment but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.</P><?oasys _cl11- ?>
    <P>The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/ special needs.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level;</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours; and</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">Under the new arrangements, the Council, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO), will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 122 at present. In common with many other psychological services, NEPS operates a staged model of service to schools, whereby an initial referral usually leads to a consultation and provision of advice to teachers and parents on appropriate teaching and management strategies. Progress is kept under review and only those children who fail to respond to these interventions will need to see a psychologist. This allows psychologists to offer early appointments to children who are in urgent need of support and early advice to teachers in respect to those children whose needs are perhaps less pressing but who still need additional help in school. NEPS is committed to early intervention with pupils with Special Educational Needs in primary schools in order to address the needs of such pupils at the earliest point in their schooling, Support for such students in second level schools is likely to be based on a review of needs rather than a repeat of the formal psycho-educational assessment.</P>
    <P>Given the increasing number of children with special needs now availing of the opportunity of a mainstream second level education, my Department has put in place a strategy which involves the provision of training and support at initial teacher education and also the provision of training and support for continuous professional development.</P>
    <P>In terms of initial teacher education, the Education Degree and Higher Diploma in Education <Col N="826"/>programmes include elements on the learning difficulties of pupils as part of a general alertness orientation programme.</P>
    <P>Separate post-graduate programmes for Learning Support Teachers and Special Education Needs Teachers are provided by seven third-level institutions with the support of my Department. In addition, a new combined post-graduate programme of training for Learning Support and Special Education Needs is being offered to teachers from September 2006. My Department also funds a Masters Programme in Special Education Needs which is offered in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College.</P>
    <P>The Special Education Support Service (SESS) was established in 2003 to consolidate, co-ordinate, develop and deliver a range of professional development initiatives and support to teachers working with special needs. A very significant expansion of this Service is in progress which will greatly enhance the service provided to schools.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the measures outlined will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

    <P FLI="0">The level of student intake to the Colleges of Education is determined annually by my Department and it takes account of the supply of, and demand for, primary teachers while also having regard to available resources.

My Department recently sanctioned grant assistance to support the 2006 annual general meeting of the Union and also provided conference facilities to support the meeting at my Department&rsquo;s offices in Marlborough Street.</P>
    <P>I do not think it appropriate for my Department to contribute to the running of a representative body such as USS. My Department does not provide such funding for the Union of Students in Ireland, nor indeed for the teaching unions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 82 together.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The National Adult Learning Council was formed in March 2002 on an ad hoc basis with the intention that it would be established as a statutory body under Section 54 of the Education Act 1998. Following the formation of the ad-hoc Council, concerns emerged that the functions envisaged for the Council were too wide-ranging and were not sufficiently focused. Additionally, a number of developments had occurred which would impact on the work of the Council, including the establishment of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the Further and Higher Education and Training Awards Councils.</P><Col N="829"/>
    <P>My Department undertook a strategic review of the role and functions of the Council to address these concerns. The results of this review are being considered and I am awaiting proposals from my Department as to the role and functions of the Council in the light of the review. I expect to be in a position to take a decision in this matter in the near future.</P>

	<P>Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for the Government, for parents, for agencies that work with children and for society generally and I can assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to do all that we can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe.</P>
    <P>In the education sector, vetting is currently available in respect of prospective employees of children in detention schools as well as special needs assistants (SNAs) and bus escorts to children with special needs. My colleague Brian Lenihan TD, Minister for Children, announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the Garda Central Vetting Unit &mdash; which has been relocated to Thurles under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme &mdash; in order to ensure that they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children, whether on a full-time or part-time basis.</P>
    <P>As a first step in the expansion of services provided by the Vetting Unit, it is proposed that new staff employed in the 2006/07 school year will be vetted. In the case of new teachers, vetting will form part of the process of the registration by the newly established Teaching Council. The Council will be responsible for submitting the applications to the Vetting Unit. In the case of non-teaching staff, it will be the responsibility of the relevant school authorities to submit the applications.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in discussions with the relevant interests &mdash; school management authorities, unions, the Teaching Council and the Vetting Unit &mdash; on the procedures and processes which will apply in relation to the vetting of persons in the education sector. Guidelines for school authorities are being prepared and will be issued shortly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 58 and 59 together.</P>
    <P>In launching &ldquo;School Matters&rdquo; the final Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, I outlined a package of measures to tackle student behaviour issues. In my view, implementation of the report must be approached in a prioritised and carefully structured way.</P>
    <P>The putting in place of a Behaviour Support Team is at the core of many of the Task Force recommendations. I see it as a critical first step in their implementation. The role of this team will span the spectrum from diagnosis of school prob<Col N="831"/>lems to assistance with remediation. It is expected that this team will be in place in the next school year and will be working with up to 50 schools. This team will work with schools that are experiencing significant discipline problems. It will be staffed by experienced practitioners from across the education sector, including additional psychologists dedicated to this area.</P>
    <P>The Behaviour Support Team will become intensively involved in the school over a period of time. The desired outcome of this is an identification, at school level, of those measures and changes which need to be put in place in order to bring about a real and sustained improvement in student behaviour.</P>
    <P>I also intended to trial up to 30 Behaviour Support Classrooms in those schools experiencing severe behavioural difficulties with students. Schools chosen to trial a Behaviour Support Classroom will be expected to demonstrate a real commitment to dealing with all causes of the discipline problem in their school.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of Behaviour Support Team has already commenced with advertisements appearing in the national press. Allowing for the fact that we will undoubtedly be drawing many of the members of the team from the school system, it is nonetheless my intention that it will be fully operating in the next school year.</P>
    <P>The Junior Certificate Schools Programme is a critical intervention in many schools at present and one which is proposed for expansion by the Task Force. It is intended to allow appropriate and focused expansion of this programme where proposals to this effect result from the engagement of the Behaviour Support Team with individual schools.</P>
    <P>The Task Force report recommends the expansion of existing Youth Encounter Projects and Youthreach services instead of putting in place a new service of out of school provision. My Department&rsquo;s Regional Offices network will compile a comprehensive list of existing alternative educational provision nationwide, which the Behaviour Support Team will analyse. This will in turn provide a capacity to augment existing provision where gaps exist.</P>
    <P>The Task Force also recommended that the Section 29 legislation be amended to stress the rights of the compliant majority to learn while at the same time protecting the rights of the persistently disruptive student to an education. It also recommends that the timeframe involved in these appeals be looked at. I have decided to review existing legislation in order to take account of the Task Force recommendations and to bring forward amending legislation as soon as this review is complete.</P>
    <P>The report&rsquo;s recommendations require action and engagement from a wide range of participants in our education system. For my part, as Minister, I have given a clear statement of my <Col N="832"/>commitment to sustained and considered action in dealing with the issue of student behaviour.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 88 together.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to PE facilities in primary schools generally is that the PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</P>
    <P>My Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities. The provision of such facilities is an integral part of the design process for new school buildings or where an existing school building is undergoing major refurbishment.</P>
    <P>The School Planning Section of my Department is working proactively with some local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities. This enhanced cooperation has the effect of minimising my Department&rsquo;s land requirements and thus reducing site costs while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities such as sports facilities, playing pitches etc. The Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Art, Sports and Tourism is currently undertaking a national audit of sports facilities in communities around the country, which will also provide useful information on facilities available to schools.</P>
    <P>The Government has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of under investment in school infrastructure. However the Government&rsquo;s record school building programme is delivering modern school accommodation, including sports facilities, in schools throughout the country.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would disagree with the suggestion that only a quarter of secondary schools are adequately equipped to teach science. As part of the multi-annual school building programme my Department has invested heavily in modernising school facilities throughout the country including science facilities in post-primary schools. Typically this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science. Additionally I have provided for class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences.</P>
    <P>My Department also spent in excess of &euro;13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of &euro;3500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding. Funding is also available this year to schools that have yet to apply for the basic grant of &euro;3,500 per science laboratory and for other specified equipment to enable them to provide the new curriculum.</P>
    <P>Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Scheme in 2004 and 2005 to refurbish science laboratories. In the application for funding under the 2006 Summer Works Scheme post-primary schools were asked to specifically identify and provide details of any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being <Col N="834"/>applied for so that consideration could be given to approving these projects for 2006. I approved funding for 26 such projects under the 2006 Summer Works Scheme. The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to take a proactive approach in the provision of the necessary facilities for the teaching of science in schools.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is planned that 214 whole-school evaluations will be undertaken in primary schools during 2006. 41 whole-school evaluations commenced before 6th February 2006. The reports on these evaluations will be issued to schools but they will not be published as they were initiated prior to the introduction of the regulations on publication of reports. 25 of these WSEs have been fully completed and the reports have been issued or are currently being issued to schools by the Department. It is expected that the remaining evaluations that are not for general publication will be available for issue to schools before the end of the current school term.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements for publication of WSE reports there is a minimum period of 14 weeks (70 school days) from the date of the final in-school evaluation activity until the WSE report is cleared for issue to schools and for publication. This period includes time for writing the report, for feedback to the board of management and the teachers, for factual verification and to enable the <Col N="835"/>board of management respond to the report if it so wishes.</P>
    <P>At present approximately 32 primary WSE reports are with schools for either factual verification or school response. It is not possible to say precisely when these WSE reports will have completed all stages of the pre-publication process as this is the first time that schools are engaging in a written factual verification process and an optional school response process as part of the evaluation procedure. However, I anticipate that a significant proportion of the reports will be finalised for issue to schools and published on the Department&rsquo;s website before the end of June 2006.</P>
    <P>It is projected that 173 whole-school evaluation reports will be published arising from evaluations conducted at primary level between 6 February and the end of December 2006. Because of the 14 week pre-publication procedure some reports arising from evaluations conducted towards the end of 2006 will not be published until early in 2007.</P>
    <P>Finally I wish to point out to the deputy that there is an appeal process under Section 13(9) of the Education Act (1998) whereby a teacher or board may request a review of an inspection. Where such a review is initiated this will inevitably delay publication of the report.</P>

	<P>The National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) issued questionnaires for its Census of School Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT) Infrastructure for both Primary and Post-Primary schools last May. The census follows similar exercises undertaken in 1998, 2000 and 2002 and addresses a range of areas including the extent of ICT equipment, networking and internet access, ICT planning and priorities, professional development and technical support.

    <P>The Commission is also hearing evidence on oath from witnesses who have relevant testimony to give and analysing relevant documentary material. When sufficient information has been obtained, the inquiry members will assess the evidential material and come to conclusions.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 68, 79 and 80 together.</P>
    <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was established under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
    <P>The budget allocated to the NEWB for 2006 is &euro;8.15m. This allocation represents an increase of more than 25% since 2004 to support it in delivering on its key objectives. To discharge its responsibilities, the Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
    <P>The total authorised staffing complement of the Board is 94 comprising 16 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 12 senior educational welfare officers and 61 educational welfare officers. This number includes an additional 10 posts which were filled in September 2005. In deploying its service staff, the NEWB has prioritised the provision of services to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams are in place with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvan<Col N="838"/>tage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme providing an intensive full level of service. For all remaining areas the NEWB deploy their staff on a regional basis providing various levels of service.</P>
    <P>Towns which have an educational welfare officer allocated to them include Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo, Naas, Castlebar, Longford, Tuam, Tullamore, Letterkenny and Portlaoise. In addition, the Board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Since September 2005 every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Board that the current average caseload of each EWO is 131. This shows a reduction from the number reported in July 2005 when the average was 164. This can be accounted for by the filling of 10 additional EWO posts in September 2005. The Board is continuously reviewing its procedures for prioritising children and families who require intervention, in order to ensure that children with the greatest level of need gain maximum benefit from available resources, and to work with local agencies in prioritising children&rsquo;s and family needs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the NEWB personnel there are some 490 staff, within the education sector, deployed in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves an element of school attendance. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB&rsquo;s budget allocation and staffing under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs and in the context of Government policy on public service numbers.</P>

In relation to Irish, this report recommended that a separate syllabus for native speakers of Irish should be developed. As part of the second phase of the review, the NCCA is preparing a discussion paper which will outline the advantages and disadvantages of developing such a syllabus for both junior and senior cycle. This paper will be the subject of a consultation process in the autumn. When the Harris Report, the Inspectorate report and the NCCA advice become available, I will give careful consideration to their conclusions and recommendations.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 47, 50 and 70 together.</P>
    <P>First, I wish to point out that the provision of speech and language therapists and of occupational therapists is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologists or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS. Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s Website. The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.</P>
    <P>NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for Reasonable Accommodation in Certificate Examinations and responds to queries in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the NEPS in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 122 at present. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers. The Public Appointments Service has concluded a new recruitment competition for the appointment of Educational Psychologists to NEPS. Regional panels have been established to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need. My Department is currently in the process of recruiting a further 9 psychologists.</P>
    <P>Statistical data relating to assessments carried out by NEPS psychologists are maintained on a school year basis. Those data indicate that in the 2004/2005 school year, NEPS psychologists consulted with schools in a total of 5,986 cases. The total number of cases involving a full psychological assessment was 3,409. The balance in the number of cases included other forms of assessment such as testing of attainments, classroom <Col N="841"/>observations, discussion with parents and teachers. Under the SCPA scheme that NEPS administers, 3467 children were assessed in the 2005 calendar year at a cost of &euro;1,144,242 in direct fee payments to the psychologists concerned. Financial provision of &euro;15.425 million has been made for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) in the 2006 Revised Estimates Volume provision for my Department. This represents an increase of 10% on the 2005 out-turn for NEPS.</P>
    <P>In common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. The General Allocation of resources to primary schools ensures that many children can receive additional teaching without the requirement of psychological assessment.</P>
    <P>Children who manifest very special needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will normally be assessed by the psychologist within that school term.</P>
    <P>Where schools consider that they have additional problems, they should contact the NEPS psychologist directly or make contact with the NEPS Regional Director for their region. Contact details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>The Youth Work Act 2001 provides a legal framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services to be organised by the Minister for Education and Science, the Vocational Education Committees and national and regional youth work organisations. Section 1 of the Act provides for sections to be commenced at different stages, and to date Sections 2-7, 17, 18 and 24 have been commenced.</P>
    <P>As I advised the House in April, a sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, representative of both statutory and voluntary sectors as well as my Department, has <Col N="842"/>been steadily progressing the groundwork, including the development of detailed guidelines and procedures, which are vital for the further rollout of the Act in a planned and structured manner. The work of this sub-committee is continuing.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the additional &euro;2.839m secured in 2006 for the main funding line for the youth work sector will be used to develop the youth work service in a strategic manner and will include the progressive roll out of the Youth Work Act 2001. The resourcing of VECs, including the appointment of Youth Work Officers, to carry out the functions set out for them under the Act has been agreed in principle by my Department and the IVEA. My Department is currently finalising the detail involved. This will be a significant step forward which will allow for the development of local youth work plans and ensure co-ordination of youth work programmes and services in the area with education and other programmes for young people.</P>
    <P>I identified the capacity development of voluntary youth work organisations to assist them in preparing themselves organisationally for the implementation of the Act as a priority for 2005. To this end I established a Development Fund to help ensure that youth work organisations can achieve the new standards for approval and engage effectively with the new structures arising from the Youth Work Act 2001. Some 30 national and major regional youth organisations received once-off grants amounting to over &euro;300,000 to help develop their ICT capacity in 2005. I am making similar funding available to national and major voluntary youth work organisations in 2006 and my Department is currently discussing priority areas for development with the various youth work interests.</P>
    <P>This work, together with other policy and developmental areas including the appointment of an Assessor of Youth Work, the establishment of the National Youth Work Development Unit, and the establishment of a North South Education and Training Standards Committee for Youth Work, will help us build an excellent service that is responsive to the needs of all young people.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools <Col N="843"/>down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
    <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
    <P>All schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. In the 2004/2005 school year, the most recent year for which details are available, there were 155,398 children in primary classes of 25 to 29 pupils inclusive. This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.</P>

     <Quest>the measures which are in place to ensure that all the children in the Dublin west area will have a school place in September 2006; her plans to address the huge overcrowding in schools in that part of Dublin where more than half of the pupils are in classes larger than 30; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have stated publicly on a number of occasions that I am acutely aware that Dublin 15 is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country and, that as a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for primary school places.</P>
    <P>I have also outlined the significant interventions being made by my Department to tackle this issue. These include measures to increase the capacity of existing schools along with the development of new schools to meet the growing demand. All building projects arising from these <Col N="844"/>interventions are awarded a band 1 priority rating under my Department&rsquo;s prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects which means that they will be delivered in the fastest time frame possible.</P>
    <P>In the Littlepace/Castaheaney area a new school building has recently been completed at Mary Mother of Hope National School, with an additional project underway with a target delivery date of September 2007. In addition, a new primary school campus is planned for a school site in Ongar which will have a minimum of 32 classrooms. Part of this project will provide a permanent accommodation solution for Castaheaney Educate Together National School. This project also has a target completion date of September 2007.</P>
    <P>Over and above this provision significant additional school places will be available this coming September through the expansion of existing provider&rsquo;s facilities. In this regard, Castaheaney Educate Together NS will take an additional class of junior infants and a completely new primary school will commence operation under the Patronage of the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. These two developments alone will greatly ease the pressure on school places in the area.</P>
    <P>In the Diswellstown area, St. Patrick&rsquo;s National School has recently moved into a new 24 classroom school. This will facilitate an annual 3 stream intake. As an exceptional measure the Board of Management has agreed to take a fourth stream of Junior infants this year. In addition to this, the Board of Management of St. Mochta&rsquo;s National School, which currently has an intake of 3 junior infant classes, has agreed to enrol a fourth Junior Infant class for September 2006. An extension project to cater for this development will also be expedited.</P>
    <P>Other developments in the Dublin 15 area include the planned expansion of St. Brigid&rsquo;s National School in Castleknock and extensions to St. Brigid&rsquo;s Boys and Girls National Schools, Blanchardstown. In Tyrrellstown, a new Educate Together school opened in September 2005. My Department has approved the provision of six additional classrooms for September 2006 to cater for new enrolments and Special Education Teachers. It is anticipated that this school will enrol three junior infant classes.</P>
    <P>My Department will also be providing additional accommodation for St. Ciaran&rsquo;s National school in Hartstown to cater for its accommodation needs for next September and it will be looking at the long term requirements of the school to provide it with permanent accommodation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to class sizes the position is that major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the <Col N="845"/>expansion of free education. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil teacher ratio in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion that I launched in May 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in the 180 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>
    <P>Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next 2 years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools. At present the general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done this. And now, in line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in November 2004 I announced funding for the National College of Art and Design (NCAD). The funding was targeted at the refurbishment of the fire station in Thomas Street. This funding was approved on foot of the work by the Kelly Review Group on the prioritisation of capital projects across the third level sector in general. To date, this project has not advanced to construction because the College authorities have been assessing existing provision within the College and exploring alternative options for the future development of the College. At the same time my Department was aware that the College authorities were examining accommodation solutions in relation to the totality of the Thomas Street campus in line with the campus development plan that they had developed.</P>
    <P>I understand that An Bord of NCAD recently decided that it wishes to remain at the Thomas Street campus. My Department in association with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) is of course willing to consider the implications of this decision in the context of the original campus development plan or any amendment of it that the college authorities decide to put forward.</P>

	<P>At primary school level, social, environmental and scientific education enables the child to learn and practise a wide range of skills; and to acquire open, critical and responsible attitudes, including caring for animals. In particular, the science curriculum seeks to cultivate in children an appreciation of, and respect for, the diversity and interdependence of living things. Children are given opportunities to observe, discuss and identify animals, both in their immediate environment and in other environments, and so come to an understanding of the needs of animals for growth. Through the science curriculum, children also come to recognise that people, plants and animals depend on each other.</P>
    <P>At second level, Civic Social and Political Education (CSPE) is a mandatory subject for junior cycle students and it is an examinable subject for the Junior Certificate Examination. Focusing on concepts, attitudes and values, the programme aims to develop the moral and critical values of the student. In the CSPE &mdash; Guidelines for Teachers, animals are listed as one of the topical issues in the section dealing with rights and <Col N="847"/>responsibilities. Action projects undertaken by CSPE class groups have dealt in detail with the responsibilities of animal owners.</P>
    <P>Also at junior cycle, one of the aims of the Science syllabus is to &rdquo;foster an appreciation of, and respect for, life and the environment&ldquo;. Derived from this aim, and building on the primary science curriculum, one of the objectives of the syllabus is that &rdquo;The student will develop a knowledge and understanding of &ldquo;the nutritional needs of plants and animals and their interdependence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the senior cycle, the Biology syllabus affords students the opportunity to continue to explore the diversity of life and the inter-relationship between organisms and their environment. One of the aims of this syllabus is &ldquo;to enhance an interest in, and develop an appreciation of, the nature and diversity of organisms&rdquo;. The syllabus also aims &ldquo;to develop in students an ability to make informed evaluations about contemporary biological issues&rdquo;. Agricultural Science aims to give students an understanding of animal biology and the syllabus contains a section dealing primarily with the welfare of domestic farm animals. In the course of their work, teachers in different disciplines use various support materials produced by bodies such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Compassion in World Farming.</P>

	<P>Vending machines may be placed in schools at the discretion of the School&rsquo;s Management Authority and are currently installed in many post-primary schools.

	<P>Under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement reached with the religious congregations, the property contribution of the congregations is divided into two separate and distinct schedules of properties as follows:</P>
<P LI="1">(A) Properties to be transferred from the congregations to the State, State Agencies or Local Authorities after the date of the signing of the Indemnity Agreement on 5th June 2002: The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the Indemnity Agreement was set at &euro;36.54 million. I can confirm that agreement in principle has been reached with the religious congregations on the transfer of 35 properties under this schedule to the amount of &euro;38.24 million. This figure of &euro;38.24 million includes &euro;4.98 million in cash that was provided by the congregations in lieu of property.</P>
<P LI="1">(B) Properties transferring from the congregations to the State, State Agencies, Local Authorities or Voluntary Organisations from the 11th May 1999, the date of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology to victims of child abuse: The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the Indemnity Agreement was set at &euro;40.32 million. I can confirm that transfers of 29 properties to the value of approximately &euro;38.71 million have been agreed in principle under this schedule. This includes a cash payment of &euro;5.75 million made by the congregations in lieu of property.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">The properties on lists &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; below were accepted in principle by the Department following receipt of confirmation from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies that it would be to their advantage to accept title to the particular property. The current or future use of these properties is a matter for each of the transferees. In relation to properties accepted in principle by my Department these will be used to develop school provision.</P><Col N="847"/>

	<P>The Early Start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk during 1994 and 1995. There are 1,680 places in these centres.</P>
    <P>Targeted early childhood education provision is a key element of the School Support Programme (SSP) under the new action plan for educational inclusion DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new Programme. These comprise 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</P>
    <P>The objective in relation to early childhood education is to concentrate actions initially on those children aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend the 180 urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities. My Department will work in partnership with other departments and agencies to complement and add value to existing childcare programmes in disadvantaged communities, with a view to ensuring that the overall care and education needs of the children concerned are met in an integrated manner. The Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education will provide advice on the future development and direction of pre-school measures for children in disadvantaged communities and the findings of a number of evaluation reports on Early Start prepared by the Education <Col N="852"/>Research Centre will be taken into account in this regard.</P>
    <P>In December 2005, the Office of the Minister for Children was established to maximise the co-ordination of policies for children and young people and will have a range of functions previously under the Departments of Health and Children; Justice Equality and Law Reform; and Education and Science. A new Early Years Education Policy Unit has been established within my Department and will be co-located with the Office of the Minister for Children. This Unit will oversee the preparation of plans for phased implementation of the early childhood education dimension of DEIS in the targeted school communities, starting in the next school year, and this will be pursued within an overall strategic policy framework developed by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>

	<P>There were some 39 recommendations in the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences, with costed proposals totalling an additional &euro;244 million, of which &euro;66.3 million would be a recurring annual cost. Of the 39 recommendations, 4 are not for the education sector. Of the remainder, progress has been made on implementing 25 of the recommendations and my Department continues to progress the recommendations as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FORFAS and industry.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in a range of areas e.g.</P><Col N="853"/>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>A new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of &euro;1000 per school plus &euro;10.00 per pupil.</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>A revised syllabus in Junior Certificate Science was introduced in 2003 and will be examined for the first time in June 2006. Revised syllabi in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced and examined within the last five years. Work on the revision of the two remaining Leaving Certificate subjects &mdash; Agricultural Science and Physics and Chemistry (combined) &mdash; is well advanced. The introduction of each of the revised syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers.</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Additional equipment grants have been provided to schools, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme.

<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>A review of grading of subjects in the Leaving Certificate and initial reports on teacher training have been undertaken.</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>A review of mathematics at second level is being undertaken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).</P>

Between this programme and the various grants to the Research Councils, and other sources, some &euro;102.5 million was invested in third level institutions in 2005.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">I have no plans at present to make provision for laboratory technicians at primary and second level. The estimated cost of providing technicians at second level in the Task Force report was &euro;18.8m per annum at 2002 prices. Provision of technicians in this area would undoubtedly lead to demands for similar assistance across other areas of the curriculum where there is a strong practical component. It is my understanding that the availability of laboratory technicians has not been a universal feature of support for science teaching in second level schools and that in some countries that do provide this type of resource it is confined to certain types of schools. However, I will keep the general issue of technical assistance for schools under review in the light of available resources.</P>
    <P>The other major measure proposed in the Task Force Report which has not been implemented <Col N="854"/>was the investment of &euro;142.8m capital at 2002 prices in the stock of laboratories and equipment for science in post primary schools. Funds of this order are not available. However the investment of &euro;16m in 2004 enabled schools to implement the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus, and the revised syllabus is now mandatory for all schools except those which have been given a derogation on the basis of inadequate facilities. Only four schools have sought a derogation to date, and their needs are being examined and addressed by my Department&rsquo;s Building Unit.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
    <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
    <P>All schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. So, as I have pointed out the general rule in the current school year is that at least one classroom teacher is provided for every 29 pupils. Furthermore, the actual average class size nationally is 24.</P>
    <P>In the 2004/2005 school year, the most recent year for which details are available, there were 162 children in primary classes of 40 or more pupils. While this is 162 children more than should be in such large classes, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this is less than a tenth of the number of children that were in such classes in 1996/97, when 1,901 children were in classes of 40 or more.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes. Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools <Col N="856"/>do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year.</P>
    <P>Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, I often find that when I look into why a particular school has a class of 35 in a particular grade, the answer is because there is another class in the same school with a much lower than average number of pupils in it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school. This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas including the impact of inward migration and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
    <P>In planning for school provision to meet these demands my Department has adopted an area based approach which involves a public consultation process involving all interested parties. This leads to the production of a blueprint for schools&rsquo; development in an area for a timeframe of approximately ten years.</P>
    <P>The exercise recently completed on the N4-M4 corridor is an example of this and the rapidly developing areas of north Dublin, south Louth, east Meath will be examined this year. This structured process will ensure a more proactive approach to school planning than had been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>Apart from the area development planning process my Department is also proactively <Col N="857"/>engaged with local authorities on a continual basis in relation to specific areas. This is being done through improved contacts and communication protocols to ensure that the Department is better alerted about new and expanding residential areas and afforded an opportunity to ensure appropriate zoning provision for educational purposes.</P>
    <P>For example in the case of the Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) at Adamstown my Department is working closely with South Dublin County Council and the developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing. Under the SDZ arrangements there is a requirement that schools are in position ahead of or in line with demand, and I think it is one that should be adopted by other planning authorities in relation to major new housing schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department is working particularly closely with Fingal County Council to develop a joint approach to the timely provision of schools in an area of the country subject to extremely rapid development. This work is likely to provide innovative approaches to partnership which I believe can be used to advantage across the country in future.</P>
    <P>My Department prioritises school buildings for rapidly developing areas. This is achieved by assigning them a band one priority rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. Whenever possible, my Department implements a standardised design model or a design and build process to fast track delivery of the buildings themselves. Not alone does this result in speedier delivery of projects but it also achieves savings in design fees and land use arising from the use of the two storey design. Among schools completed using one of these processes is Griffeen Valley in Lucan which was completed in a 13 month timeframe.</P>
    <P>The level of work being done under the schools building programme is at an all-time high. While increased investment is a central reason for this &mdash; &euro;500m this year alone &mdash; radical changes in how projects are planned and managed have also made a major difference in ensuring that provision is delivered in line with or ahead of demand.</P>

     <Quest>if she has received a copy of the ASTI survey on science 2006; her views on its findings which include a perception on the part of students that science is a hard subject, inadequate facilities for science in many schools and only 22% of teachers use information and communications technology in their teaching on a regular basis, mainly due to lack of time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read the results of the ASTI survey to which the Deputy refers. I note that while 311 teachers participated in the survey there is no indication of the number of schools involved in the survey. Neither is the extent to which these schools formed a representative sample in terms of size, location, etc indicated. I know that 78% of participating schools were in the voluntary secondary sector although only 54% of our schools are in this sector. So, some care must be exercised in drawing conclusions from the results of this survey as presented.</P>
    <P>The survey does indicate that there is a general perception among students that the sciences, particularly the physical sciences, are difficult subjects. Similar findings have been reported in other surveys, including those carried out in other jurisdictions. It is widely recognised that students&rsquo; perceptions are influenced by a variety of factors, only some of which relate to syllabus content and assessment procedures. Notwithstanding the above, a key principle which underpins the work of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the statutory body which has responsibility for developing and revising syllabuses, is that the level of difficulty of each syllabus should be as appropriate as possible to the cohort of students for which the syllabus is intended. The State Examinations Commission also gives due cognisance to appropriate standards when producing examination papers and drawing up marking schemes in the various subjects.</P>
    <P>The report presents several statistics in relation to laboratory provision in the schools included in the survey. In the absence of any information on the size of the schools in question, it is not possible to comment on the adequacy of the numbers of laboratories quoted in the report. However, in the context of introducing the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus, schools were given an opportunity to seek a derogation from introducing the revised syllabus on the basis of a shortfall in laboratory space. Only four schools did so. The needs of these schools are being progressed by my Department&rsquo;s Building Unit of my Department. The issues around the timetabling of laboratories for a particular subject alluded to in the report are matters for local school management.</P>
    <P>To support the introduction of the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus my Department provided substantial equipment grants to schools in the Free Education Scheme. All such schools were provided with a grant of &euro;3500 for each junior science laboratory in the school. In addition, schools were invited to apply for an enhanced grant on the basis of their identified needs. In total, some &euro;16 million was made available to schools in 2004 for the purchase of equipment and the refurbishment of school laboratories in the context of the introduction of the revised syllabus.</P><Col N="859"/>
    <P>Since the introduction of the ICT in Schools Initiative in 1998 the Government has made major investment in the integration of ICT into teaching and learning. There has been significant progress in the development of ICT infrastructure in schools, in enhancing teachers&rsquo; skills and pedagogical practice and in the development of curriculum and learning resources. Since 2004, my Department has issued over &euro;20m to schools to facilitate the development of their school ICT networks. In the current school year all schools are being provided with broadband internet access as part of a joint Government- IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) project. The local schools connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network, supported by HEAnet, and a broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education. The overall costs of the Schools Broadband Programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over three years, are some &euro;30m.</P>
    <P>Regarding the use of ICT by teachers, the Inspectorate of my Department is currently undertaking an evaluation of the impact of ICT on teaching and learning at both primary and post-primary levels. I look forward to receiving the Inspectorate&rsquo;s report which I expect early in 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 71 together.</P>
    <P>All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologists or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS.</P>
    <P>Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s Website. The prioritis<Col N="860"/>ation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.</P>
    <P>NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for Reasonable Accommodation in Certificate Examinations and responds to queries in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.</P>
    <P>According to the most up to date information, 1629 primary schools have a dedicated service from NEPS, representing 50% of schools and 60% of the primary school population. 556 post-primary schools have a dedicated service from NEPS representing 74% of schools and 75% of the post-primary school population. In addition, 46 Vocational Education Committee (VEC) schools in Dublin city and county receive direct psychological services from Dublin City and County VECs.</P>
    <P>The number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 on establishment to 122 at present. The Public Appointments Service recently concluded a new recruitment competition for the appointment of Educational Psychologists to NEPS and regional panels have been established to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need. My Department is currently in the process of recruiting a further 9 psychologists. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers is privately owned and managed by the Christian Brothers. In recent weeks the Order took a decision to close the school with effect from the end of the current school year.</P>
    <P>I am already on record as saying that closing the school at such short notice is an extremely unusual decision which is understandably very upsetting and distressing for the parents, staff and pupils involved. It also put my Department in a very awkward position in relation to obtaining alternative placements for the pupils in question for next September.</P>
    <P>Having said that my Department pressed on with its efforts to ensure that an orderly closure would ensue. Thanks to the co-operation of another school in the area, I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that this has been achieved. The school in question will now close on a phased basis over the next year.</P>
    <P>Given that the decision to close the school was taken by the Christian Brothers, it is a matter for them to inform their parents and staff of the precise details of the new arrangement which will take effect from next September. I understand that this process has commenced.</P>
    <P>I want to take the opportunity to record my thanks to the school which is assisting in the new arrangement. It is no easy task for any school to re-organise itself at any time much less with a minimum of notice. I greatly appreciate the willingness with which the school engaged with my Department in this matter and I am happy to provide it with the resources necessary to implement the new arrangement.</P>

	<P>VTOS programmes are delivered in VEC premises, adult education centres, and premises rented by VECs specifically for the purpose of delivering the VTOS.</P>
    <P>VECs are given an annual non-pay grant to cover the cost of overheads such as light, heat, maintenance of premises, purchase of equipment, and provision of books and materials for students. In January 2006 VECs were given an increase in this non-pay funding from &euro;19,046, to <Col N="863"/>&euro;22,600, for each core group of 20 students. This represents an 18.66% increase.</P>
    <P>Since 2001 each VEC who incurred rental costs, has been given a supplement towards such costs. In 2005, this supplement, given to 21 VECs, amounted to just under &euro;1 million. In 2006, approximately &euro;6.2 million will be given to VECs to cover these non-pay items.</P>

	<P>It is planned that 271 whole-school evaluations will be undertaken in 2006, 214 in primary schools and 57 in post-primary schools. Reports on 50 of these whole-school evaluations will be issued to schools but will not be published as they were initiated prior to 6th February 2006, the date on which the regulations on publication of reports came into effect.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements for publication of WSE reports there is a minimum period of 14 weeks (70 school days) from the date of the final in-school evaluation activity until the WSE report is cleared for issue to schools and for publication. This period includes time for writing the report, for feedback to the board of management and the teachers, for factual verification and to enable the board of management respond to the report if it so wishes.</P>
    <P>At present 32 primary whole-school evaluation reports and 6 post-primary whole-school evaluation reports are with the school for either factual verification or school response. I anticipate that a significant proportion of these reports will be finalised for issue to schools and published on the Department&rsquo;s website before the end of June 2006.</P>
    <P>It is projected that 221 whole-school evaluation reports will be published arising from evaluations conducted in primary and post-primary schools between 6th February and the end of December 2006. Because of the 14 week pre-publication procedure some reports arising from evaluations conducted towards the end of 2006 will not be published until early in 2007.</P>
    <P>Finally I wish to point out to the deputy that there is an appeal process under Section 13(9) of the Education Act (1998) whereby a teacher or board may request a review of an inspection. Where such a review is initiated this will inevitably delay publication of the report.</P>

    <P>I have no plans at present to extend the free tuition fees schemes to include part-time students.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy of the provisions under Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This provides tax relief for eligible persons, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and postgraduate courses in non EU countries.</P>
    <P>Tax relief for courses of at least two years&rsquo; duration at undergraduate level extends to approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges in the State and any other EU Member State and approved full/part-time courses operated by Colleges in any EU Member State providing distance education in the State.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 96 together.</P>
    <P>Government commitment to the PLC sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers&rsquo; pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is very significant.</P>
    <P>We have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996/97. Indeed, the number of PLC places approved for 2005/2006 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004/05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188.</P>
    <P>We also extended the provision of maintenance grants to PLC students with effect from September 1998. The PLC maintenance grant scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education. There were nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they received some &euro;23 million in direct support. Tuition fees for PLC courses are also waived.</P>
    <P>PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of <Col N="867"/>running costs. A supplementary non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. This amounted to &euro;5.5 million in 2005.</P>
    <P>In addition, capital funding for works at eleven post-Leaving Certificate Colleges in 2006 has been agreed.</P>
    <P>Other developments funded by my Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the Institutes of Technology.</P>
    <P>The McIver Report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations. It has been estimated, in consultation with management and staff interests, that the recommendations for staffing would involve at a minimum the creation of at least 800 new posts at a cost of over &euro;48 million. This level of additional provision cannot be considered in isolation from other areas of education.</P>
    <P>I want to invest in educational opportunity for learners in Further Education by providing the necessary system supports that will allow the sector as a whole to fulfil its important potential.</P>
    <P>The non-teaching educational tasks particular to PLC teachers, the demands on the management side and the challenges presented by the variation in size of the 200 plus PLC providers are under very active consideration by officials at present. I expect to receive these proposals shortly. It is intended to table concrete proposals for discussion on the way forward. The positive engagement of the main partners will be sought to advance this agenda.</P>

	<P>It is planned that 57 whole school evaluations will be undertaken at post-primary level in 2006, 29 in the period January to June 2006 and 28 in the period September-December 2006. 9 of these WSEs commenced prior to 6 February 2006. The reports on these evaluations have been issued to schools or are about to be issued to schools.

    <P>At present 6 post primary WSE reports are with the schools for factual verification or school response. It is not possible to say precisely when these reports will have completed all stages of the pre-publication process as this is the first time that schools are engaging in a written factual verification process and an optional school response as part of the evaluation procedure. However, I anticipate that most, if not all, of these reports will be finalised for issue to schools and published on the Department&rsquo;s website before the end of June 2006.</P>
    <P>It is projected that 48 whole-school evaluation reports will be published arising from evaluations conducted at post-primary level between 6th February and the end of December 2006.

	<P>There is no up to date research on the number of children who do not transfer from primary to post-primary education on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently planning the development of a Primary Pupils Database, which will facilitate the collation of much more accurate and comprehensive data on transfer rates in the future. Together with the current Post-Primary Pupil Database, this will allow much improved tracking of where children go after primary school.</P>
    <P>Measures designed to improve school completion include the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board in 2002 with a remit <Col N="869"/>to monitor school attendance and tackle the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving, which includes the transfer of pupils from primary to post primary.</P>
    <P>Working with parents to promote school attendance is an important part of the work of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) and in addition to this, a key component of the School Completion Programme (SCP) is developing strong links between primary and post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The School Support Programme under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The new action plan is being introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year. It will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40m on full implementation.</P>
    <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new Programme. These comprise 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</P>
    <P>The key principle of early intervention, to identify and help children at risk of leaving school early is a major component of DEIS, with a continuing emphasis being placed on the development of effective transfer programmes for pupils making the transition to second-level, by building on the existing work of the HSCL scheme and the School Completion Programme in this area. Initiatives such as Familiarisation Days and week-long transfer programmes for new entrants to second level have been shown to have very positive results in helping children to make a smooth transition to their new school and I am anxious that a strengthening of such programmes be prioritised under the new Action Plan. The additional guidance counselling provision, being made available for second-level schools having the highest concentrations of disadvantage, will also assist in this regard.</P>

    <P>The two Devolved Schemes, the Small Schools Scheme and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme, were originally introduced on a pilot basis in 2003 and due to the positive feedback from schools were extended to cover more schools over the last two years.</P>
    <P>The Schemes are not structured on the basis that the Department funding must be supplemented by local fundraising. They do however allow a school to supplement the funding from local resources if they so wish. The critical element is that with devolved authority the school must set the scope of works to match the funding allocated. The Department does not define the precise works to be carried out. A school can make choices within the budget allocated.</P>
    <P>Setting the scope of works is the critical first step. Clearly where a school has a known level of resources apart from the Department funding or knows its capacity to raise additional resources it is open to that school to extend the scope of works to include additional facilities. However if the scope of works is not set appropriately from the outset based on the budget available there is a risk that the school will be faced with a funding gap when the project is at construction.</P>
    <P>The choices to be made within these devolved schemes rest with the school and that is the cornerstone of any policy of devolution. The school authority knows the budget and must decide what it is capable of building with that budget. The time to identify a problem is at the outset before entering any contract. Schools can raise with my Department any site specific problems or unusual planning stipulations that impose additional costs and these will be examined. Otherwise schools must reduce the scope of intended works so as to remain within budget.</P>
    <P>A school does not have to accept the invitation to participate in a devolved scheme and instead be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project&rsquo;s priority band rating.</P>
    <P>The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included. I order to maintain this momentum; I have invited over 210 additional schools to participate in these schemes in 2006.</P>

The database will be a very useful tool for the Department in evaluating the effectiveness of educational initiatives and I am anxious that it be developed as soon as is practicable. However, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the project must be developed carefully to ensure that the final product meets the needs both of schools and of the Department. A Post-Primary Pupil Database already exists. That database records actual enrolments in each second-level school as of the 30th of September in each school year.</P>

	<P>In order to ensure that children who do not have English or Irish as a first language are not at a disadvantage in educational terms, my Department gives additional support to schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional temporary teacher posts or portions of teacher posts.</P>
    <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of non-English speaking students enrolled. In the current school year, 541 whole-time equivalent language support teachers are in place at primary level and 262 whole-time equiv<Col N="872"/>alent teachers are in place at second level to support such pupils, representing an investment of &euro;46.5 million. This compares to 149 and 113 teachers respectively in the school year 2001/02.</P>
    <P>However, I am aware that schools with significant numbers of children who do not have English or Irish as a first language need extra supports over and above those already provided and I am currently working on proposals in relation to this. Among other matters, the proposals will address the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
    <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
    <P>All schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>So, as I have pointed out the general rule in the current school year is that at least one classroom teacher is provided for every 29 pupils. Furthermore, the actual average class size nationally is 24.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, some schools do have classes with 35-39 pupils in them. However, there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of children in such classes from 50,289 in 1996/97 to 8,931 in <Col N="873"/>2004/05, the latest year for which figures are available.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year.</P>
    <P>Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, I often find that when I look into why a particular school has a class of 35 in a particular grade, the answer is because there is another class in the same school with a much lower than average number of pupils in it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</P>
    <P>This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 259 together.</P>
    <P>The relocation of DIT, which is currently spread over 30 different sites in Dublin, to a 65-acre campus in Grangegorman is a major priority for this Government. The move will enable the Institute to provide better academic and support services for its nearly 20,000 students. It will also allow for much greater academic and social interaction between students of many different disciplines, providing a dynamic environment for a broad third level education in the heart of Dublin city centre.</P>
    <P>It also has great potential to regenerate an underdeveloped area of the North Inner city.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the appointment of Mr. John Fitzgerald, City Manager, Dublin City Council as Chairman of the Grangegorman Development Agency and I am now actively considering the other appointments to the Agency.</P>
    <P>The general aim of the Agency is to oversee the Development of the lands at Grangegorman on behalf of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Health Service Executive.</P>
    <P>The Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005 provides for a total membership of 15 in the agency including the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer. There is no specific provision for a student or staff representative from the DIT. The legislation does provide that 2 ordinary members of the agency will be nominated by the President of DIT and it is clearly a matter for the President to determine who to nominate having regard to the functions of the agency set out in the Act and its governance role in relation to the development.</P>
    <P>The legislation recognises the student body of DIT specifically among the stakeholders that should be represented on the Consultative Group provided for in Section 22 of the Act. Up to 2 members of the Consultative Group can come from the student body.</P>
    <P>My officials recently met the President of DIT Students&rsquo; Union and explained how the Consultative Group will give the stakeholders an opportunity to outline their views and participate fully in the Grangegorman development. The Act also provides for the Consultative Group to hold as many meetings as may be necessary to maintain an adequate communications strategy concerning the development of the Grangegorman site. The Consultative Group reports to the Chairperson of the Agency.</P>

	<P>Financial data relating to the operation of the School Building Programme are maintained on a calendar year basis. The information which I am providing below reflects this position in the calendar year to December 2005.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure of &euro;6.468 million was incurred in respect of the purchase of prefabricated buildings at primary and post primary level in 2005. This expenditure included the supply and installation of prefabricated buildings, associated site works and related costs such as compliance with planning permission conditions, professional fees, and connections for water, electricity and sewage. This expenditure represents 1.29% of the &euro;501.262m expenditure on school buildings in 2005.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure on rental of temporary school premises, which includes the cost of renting prefabricated buildings, in 2005 was &euro;15.75m or less than 3.2% of the total expenditure on school buildings in the same period.</P>
    <P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
    <P>The focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, in a permanent manner rather than relying on temporary accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money.</P>
    <P>My Department has also used other innovative solutions to deliver urgently required permanent accommodation for schools in rapidly developing areas. An example of this is the new 16 classroom primary school for Griffeen Valley Educate Together National School, Lucan, which was delivered through the use of a design and build contract within 13 months.</P>

	<P>A range of actions that focus on improving students&rsquo; competences in spoken and written Irish and on increasing the attractiveness of the language to all learners in our schools has been taken and plans are in place for further actions to take effect in the near future.</P>
    <P>At primary level, a revised curriculum in Irish has been implemented in all schools since September 2003. A communicative, task-based approach to language learning is at the heart of this curriculum which places emphasis on enjoyment and on using the language in activities such as games, conversations and drama. Its implementation has been supported by an extensive programme of in-service training for all primary teachers.</P>
    <P>For Leaving Certificate Irish, a revised literature course was introduced in September 2004 which will be examined for the first time in June of this year. This has been widely welcomed as it allows literature to be taught using modern communicative approaches that appeal to young people and it affords a high level of choice to students and teachers. For example, film is now an option for the first time. A comprehensive set of guidelines to support teachers in delivering the revised course has been issued.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements are being made in regard to the provision of materials and resources for the teaching of Irish. An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta has been established to progress this area and to provide support services for schools. Funding has been provided to An Chomhairle to support this task.</P>
    <P>I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the statutory body which advises on curriculum, to make proposals to me as soon as possible on how the syllabuses in Irish at post-primary level should be reformed and, in particular, how greater emphasis can be placed on oral competence in the language. I am determined to ensure that Irish is taught in our schools in a way that is interesting and relevant and will promote a positive attitude to the language among our young people.</P>
    <P>Recently, I announced my intention to appoint additional personnel to support the teaching of Irish in our schools. Progress has already been made on recruiting 30 cuiditheoir&iacute; to work with primary teachers and a national co-ordinator along with a team of regional development officers to support second level teachers. It is planned that these people will take up their appointments in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I have arranged that part of the drama in-service training planned for primary teachers in the next academic year will be &lsquo;Drama&iacute;ocht tr&iacute; Ghaeilge&rsquo;. This will assist teachers enormously in making the learning of Irish fun for children.</P>

	<P>The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age and Rule 64 (1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least 4 years of age before she/he may be enrolled in a National School. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a National School and overall there are more than enough places available.</P>
    <P>Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</P>
    <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>People need to be able to obtain, in an integrated manner, the services most appropriate to their particular health and personal social service needs. In the vast majority of cases, it is appropriate that these services be provided within the primary care or community setting and that people have recourse to the acute hospital system only where their condition requires it.</P>
    <P>General practitioner co-operatives provide the means for patients, both medical card and private, to access appropriate qualified medical care out of hours, including domiciliary visits where deemed appropriate, by dialling a lo-call number. Out-of-hours co-operatives are now in place in all HSE areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties. It is estimated that over two million people are currently covered by out-of-hours co-operatives and that additional funding provided in 2006 should allow for up to 350,000 additional persons to be covered.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the further development of GP co-ops so that, ultimately, such services will <Col N="882"/>be available to all of the population. The putting in place of appropriate arrangements for large urban areas, including Dublin, is a particular priority in this regard.</P>
    <P>The main objective of Community Intervention Teams is the prevention of avoidable hospital admission and the facilitation of early discharge from hospitals. These services are additional to existing mainstream community services and will enable the fast-tracking of non-medical care or supports for an interim period, while mainstream services are being arranged for the patient. This service is focused on the adult population and 85%+ of the anticipated cohort of patients to be supported will be in the population over 65 years old. The phased implementation of this model is being introduced first in Cork City and will then be introduced into Dublin South, Dublin North &amp; Limerick.</P>
    <P>The 2006 Estimate for the HSE includes an additional &euro;10 million in revenue funding to enable the establishment of up to 100 new primary care teams. This will enable the provision of some 300 additional frontline personnel to work alongside GPs in order to provide integrated and accessible services in the community. Work by the HSE to establish these teams is underway. In planning for the establishment of these teams, the Executive intends to concentrate where possible on areas of disadvantage and with significant health inequalities.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged to learn that in excess of 1,000 general practitioners have responded positively to an invitation from the HSE seeking expressions of interest in becoming involved in the further development of primary care services. In carrying out this development of services, the HSE will be focusing on the reorganisation of the resources already available to the health service and on developing new ways of working in line with the interdisciplinary service model described in the Primary Care Strategy.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided additional funding for services for older people amounting to &euro;150 million in 2006, with almost three-quarters of this being committed to community care supports. The funding provides for a number of community and home-based initiatives including Home Care Packages, the Home Help service, Day and Respite Centres, Meals-on-Wheels and Sheltered Housing, among others.</P>
    <P>Home Care packages have been piloted successfully in several regions in recent years, with just over 1100 provided to people at the end of 2005. In Budget 2006 a further &euro;55m was committed to this area, of which &euro;30m has been provided in 2006 and a further &euro;25m will be provided in 2007. This will allow for the phased introduction of a further 2,000 packages by the end of this year. The HSE has advised that 249 new Home Care packages were commenced in the first quarter of this year.</P>
    <P>Home Care packages are delivered through the HSE, by a range of providers including the <Col N="883"/>Health Service Executive itself, voluntary groups and the private sector. The scheme is intended to be as flexible as possible and highly responsive to the real needs of the individual. These packages are multidisciplinary and may include services such as nurses, home care attendants, home helps and the various therapists including physiotherapists and occupational therapists.</P>
    <P>Tackling the current difficulties with A &amp; E is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health. The service being provided to some patients in A &amp; E is unacceptable and must be improved.</P>
    <P>Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A &amp; E and do not require admission.</P>
    <P>The HSE is continuing to implement the 10-Point Action Plan. In addition, it has been agreed with the HSE that a number of additional measures will be implemented by the Executive. These include in particular the setting of performance targets for individual hospitals. In terms of implementation, the HSE is taking the following approach:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Tackling the issue on a hospital-by-hospital basis</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Developing hospital-specific time-based targets in relation to A &amp; E and delayed discharges</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Development of financial incentives linked to performance in these areas</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Development of additional targeted initiatives aimed at delivering an immediate and sustained impact.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">In the immediate term, the HSE is introducing a series of measures to improve facilities for patients and staff in A &amp; E departments. Long-term care beds are being secured from within the private sector to facilitate the discharge of patients who have completed the acute phase of their care. The acute beds that become available as a result of this initiative will be ring fenced for those patients awaiting admission in A &amp; E departments. Funding is being made available within the capital programme to develop admissions lounges to ensure that patient privacy, dignity and comfort are preserved while awaiting admission to an acute bed.</P>
    <P>The HSE has established a dedicated Task Force to oversee the implementation of the framework for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of services in A &amp; E departments. The Task Force will support individual hospitals in identifying specific problems and addressing them. It will work with hospitals to introduce a system of &ldquo;whole hospital&rdquo; performance measures to improve the patient&rsquo;s journey not alone through the A &amp; E department but through the hospital system from admission to discharge.</P><Col N="884"/>
    <P>I am confident that by improving hospital processes and procedures, by providing additional step-down beds for those patients who do not require acute hospital care, and by expanding and enhancing primary and community care services we can achieve a sustained improved in our A &amp; E services.</P>

	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI). The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
    <P>Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients. Other products are available according to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility.</P>
    <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excess<Col N="885"/>ive medicines costs. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month, or approximately &euro;20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 128 together.</P>
    <P>The Health Strategy set as a target that no public patient should wait longer than three <Col N="890"/>months for in-patient treatment in hospital following referral from an out-patient department. Responsibility for the collection and reporting of data on waiting times now rests with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). It has developed the Patient Treatment Register (PTR), which provides, for the first time, verified information on actual patients on public in-patient and day-case waiting lists. The PTR allows the NTPF to contact patients waiting more than 3 months directly with an offer of treatment. Nineteen hospitals are currently included in the PTR. It is intended to complete the roll-out of the PTR to all acute hospitals by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The latest figures from the PTR show that for the 20 most common surgical procedures, 85% of patients are waiting less than 6 months for treatment. A copy of the Report on the Patient Treatment Register, April 2006, is being provided separately to the Deputy. This report sets out in detail the position regarding waiting times by the hospital, specialty and for the 20 most common surgical procedures for adults and for the 10 most common surgical procedures for children.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the NTPF has made very significant progress in reducing waiting times for hospital treatment. The NTPF is advising anyone waiting for more than three months for an operation to contact it as, in most instances, treatment can be arranged for them.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Strategy contained a commitment to increase the number of acute hospital beds by 3000 over a ten year period. The Strategy did not set a mid-way target or a target of beds to be provided by year.</P>
    <P>In 2001, the year of the publication of Health Strategy, the average number of in-patient beds and day places available for treatment of patients in public acute hospitals was 12,145. Hospital returns for 2005 show that this number has risen to 13,255, an increase of 1,110 in-patient beds and day places. 90% of treatment places in acute hospitals are overnight in-patient beds. In addition, a further 450 acute beds/day places are in various stages of planning and development under the Capital Investment Framework 2005-2009.</P>
    <P>In July 2005, I announced an initiative to have private beds built on the campuses of public hospitals. The aim of this initiative is to enable up to 1000 beds in public hospitals, which are currently used by private patients, to be re-desig<Col N="891"/>nated for use by public patients. The HSE recently advertised for expressions of interest to construct private hospitals on the sites of 11 publicly funded hospitals. These additional in-patient beds/day places will mean that our commitment to increase total acute hospital capacity will be virtually complete.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent basic data on incomes available from which information of the type requested by the <Col N="894"/>Deputy could be derived are in respect of the income tax year 2003. If the effective rate of income tax for each income earner with gross income in excess of &euro;100,000 in 2003 is calculated as the percentage of total tax liability to total income, some 6.7 per cent of income earners in this income category had an effective tax rate of 20 per cent or lower. The corresponding percentage for income earners with gross income in excess of &euro;100,000 in 2002 was 7.5 per cent. These figures take account of Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid.</P>
    <P>To arrive at the figure for total income the gross income is reduced by various relevant deductions and allowances such as capital allowances, losses, allowable expenses and retirement annuities.</P>
    <P>It might be noted that for 2003, the tax liability of those earning over &euro;100,000 (gross income) represents 30.3% of the total income tax liability for 2003. In addition, the effective rate for those earning over &euro;100,000 in 2003 is 32.5%. This compares with an effective rate for those earning &euro;100,000 or less in 2003 of 13.2% and an effective rate for all income earners in 2003 of 16.1%. A married couple who have elected or have been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>

	<P>The report of the Tax Forecasting Methodology Review Group was published by my Department in 1998 and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. The findings and recommendations of the report were taken on board by my Department, including the key recommendation that the process whereby taxes are forecast on an individual tax head basis should be supplemented by a top-down macroeconomic test by which the forecast growth in nominal GDP is compared with the forecast growth in aggregate tax revenues.</P>
    <P>There has been no formal updating of the Review Group&rsquo;s report. However, my Department continually reviews its methodologies for forecasting tax revenues. As part of this ongoing review process, an informal working group was set up in 2002 made up of officials of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, with occasional input from other Departments and State Agencies. The purpose of this informal working group is to examine issues which may have an impact on tax yield with a view to improving our tax forecasting methodologies on an ongoing basis rather than as a once-off exercise.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>the elasticities with respect to GNP or GDP that are currently being applied by his Department in forecasting tax returns for budgetary purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20245/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Tax revenues are forecast by my Department on an individual tax head basis using, among other things, relevant macro-economic indicators and elasticity factors, where appropriate. For example, forecasts of PAYE revenues are constructed using projected increases in non-agricultural earnings and employment together with estimated elasticity factors for both (elasticity factors in this instance represent the relationship between the estimated percentage increases in PAYE tax likely to arise from average increases of 1% in earnings and employment, respectively). The current elasticity factor of PAYE tax with respect to earnings is 2.1 while the elasticity factor for new employment is 0.7. These factors can change over time.</P>
    <P>As a top-down check on the validity of the aggregate tax revenue forecast constructed on an individual tax head basis, a comparison is made with the forecast increase in the level of nominal GDP. This is known as the elasticity of tax revenue growth with respect to economic growth. In general, a long-run one to one relationship between the percentage change in nominal GDP and the percentage change in tax revenues is likely to be observed. However, this one to one relationship need not hold from year to year and can be influenced by factors such as the compo<Col N="896"/>sition of economic growth and the impact of Budget changes.</P>
    <P>In Budget 2006, tax revenues were forecast to increase by 7.3% on an underlying basis (when one-off and similar effects were removed) as compared with a projected increase of 7.9% in nominal GDP. This represents an estimated elasticity of tax revenue growth with respect to economic growth of 0.92 which was a reasonable reflection at that time of what the relationship between tax growth and economic growth might be expected to be in 2006, having regard to the factors which can influence the observed long-run relationship from one year to the next.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
     <Quest>the terms of the agreement which he has negotiated with public service unions on the share of promotion opportunities which will be confined to staff who are decentralising and the share which will remain open; and if similar terms will apply in State agencies.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20246/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Promotion practices in the public service are being managed in a way which facilitates the achievement of the decentralisation programme in an efficient manner. In the Civil Service agreement has been reached with the general service unions that all interdepartmental promotions for general service grades will be made on the basis of the appointee agreeing to move to a post in a decentralising unit or decentralising Department or Office. In addition, any appointments from open competitions are being made on the same basis.</P>
    <P>At present 40% of all general service promotion posts are filled through inter-departmental competition. This proportion will rise to 50% on 1 March next. All posts earmarked in the normal promotions sequence to be filled through inter-departmental competition will have a decentralisation clause attached. Where one of those interdepartmental vacancies arises in relation to a Dublin-based post, the post is filled by an officer who wishes to remain in Dublin and the vacancy is transferred to a decentralising department. In addition, where an organisation is moving in full, all internal promotions will include a decentralisation condition in the period of 52 weeks prior to the move. Where an organisation is moving in part, 50% of all internal promotions will include a decentralisation condition in the period of 52 weeks prior to the move taking place. These arrangements allow for a proportion of all promotions arising in civil service general service posts in the normal course to have a decentralisation condition.</P>
    <P>A parallel proposal in respect of professional and technical grades in the Civil Service is currently being discussed with the unions representing those grades.</P><Col N="897"/>
    <P>In the State agency sector, there are a range of human resource issues, including promotions, which will need to be resolved through dialogue and negotiations. In the absence of agreement with staff interests, the management and boards of agencies have a responsibility to use all available opportunities to progress the Government policy on decentralisation.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to the Decentralisation Implementation Group&rsquo;s July, 2005 report which identified progress in relation to property, implementation planning, numbers of applicants and human resources and industrial relations issues.</P>
    <P>In line with the Group&rsquo;s approach to phasing, the report provided indicative construction start and completion dates for the procurement of office accommodation in the new locations. The full contents of this report can be accessed at <i>www.decentralisation.gov.ie</i>. The final construction dates can only be confirmed when the tender process has been completed in respect of each location and are contingent on the level and quality of market interest in respect of sites, successful negotiation of contracts, receipt of acceptable planning permissions, timely completion of briefs and successful acquisition of suitable sites. This whole issue is kept under constant review by the Office of Public Works and I understand that they are currently reviewing the position on the property aspects of the Programme in light of experience to date.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s programme involves the relocation of the Department&rsquo;s Headquarters to Cavan and the Seafood and Coastal Zone functions to Clonakilty. In addition, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) are relocating to Clonakilty, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) to Dundalk and the Central Fisheries Board (CFB) to Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) has set out an indicative timetable for completion of the Department and BIM facilities, in Clonakilty in 2007. The DIG&rsquo;s timetable for relocation to Cavan is 2009. SEI&rsquo;s move to Dundalk is scheduled for 2007.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, physically relocating functions depends on providing accommodation in the decentralised locations and the complex processes involved and this is a matter for the Office of Public Works (OPW).</P>
    <P>The Department is working closely with the OPW towards delivering on the indicative timetables. In this regard, a site has been secured in Clonakilty for both the Department and BIM, and OPW are currently assessing tenders for a <Col N="911"/>design-build solution in that location. In addition, a site was secured earlier this month for the Cavan bound functions and the Department is to provide a detailed specification of requirements to OPW. Liaison with OPW on a property solution for SEI in Dundalk is also ongoing.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the Department is making good progress on relocating some functions to Cavan and Clonakilty in the near future and well in advance of the permanent moves.</P>
    <P>The lack of suitable property solutions, thus far in Carrick-on-Shannon is a particular challenge for OPW and a definitive timetable for the CFB decentralisation has not yet been finalised. The Department and the Agency continue to work with OPW on this issue and some possible options have recently been identified.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 to 159, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid&rsquo;s Headquarters and currently based in Dublin, will decentralise to <Col N="913"/>Limerick. This is scheduled to take place during the first half of 2007 and will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts.</P>
    <P>Already, a total of 35 posts in Irish Aid Headquarters, including that of Director General, are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. Nine of these officers were already serving within the Department and the remainder is made up of 18 officers who have been recruited from other Departments and Offices via the Central Applications Facility, five officers who have been assigned from inter-Departmental promotion panels and three newly-recruited officers. Sixteen officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, have also applied to decentralise to Limerick and will be taking up duty in Irish Aid.</P>
    <P>The above total of 51 represents some 41% of the posts being transferred to Limerick. The process of recruiting staff via the Central Applications Facility is ongoing. It is envisaged that the staff in general service grades, some 65 officers, who are not decentralising to Limerick, will move to other sections within the Department on a phased basis, as incoming staff who wish to do so are assigned.</P>
    <P>There are three categories of development specialists assigned to Irish Aid: Principal Development Specialists, Senior Development Specialists and Development Specialists.</P>
    <P>Three Principal Development Specialists serve in Irish Aid headquarters in Dublin. None of the three has applied to decentralise to Limerick.</P>
    <P>There are twelve Senior Development Specialists in Irish Aid headquarters. None of the twelve has applied to decentralise to Limerick. Two Senior Development Specialists originally applied to decentralise to Limerick, but subsequently withdrew their applications.</P>
    <P>There are nine Development Specialist posts in headquarters. Five Development Specialists are scheduled to decentralise. Of these, four commenced employment since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003, and one applied via the Central Applications Facility.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Discussions are ongoing centrally and locally with the trade union IMPACT about the issues involved in decentralisation, many of which have a wider Civil Service dimension. It would be my hope that a greater number of specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I should say finally that there are 18 specialists in our Aid Embassies abroad, which embassies have of course a crucial role in the implementation of the programme.</P>

A total of 1,338 applications for projects costing &euro;670 million and seeking funding of &euro;312 million were received. All of these applications, including one from the club in question and ranging in project cost from &euro;500 to &euro;25 million are currently being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s detailed assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161, 162 and 164 together.</P>
    <P>The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, excluding the National Archives, comprising approximately 130 posts, will be transferring to Killarney under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation programme. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, my Department was designated by the Decentralisation Implementation Group as one of the &ldquo;early mover&rdquo; Departments. It is expected that a planning application will be lodged by the end of this week, and construction of the new building in Killarney is expected to commence in August 2006, with an anticipated completion date in the last quarter of 2007. The number of applications received under the Central Applications Facility (CAF) for relocation to Killarney exceeds the number required for most of the grades. My officials are currently in the process of transferring these persons into the Depart<Col N="915"/>ment. Of the staff serving in my Department 9 members have indicated that they wish to relocate to Killarney and a further 16 staff have now been transferred in from other Departments. This process will proceed on a phased basis in order to facilitate a smooth transition to the new location and appropriate training for staff. No staff have been assigned to date to the decentralised location.</P>
    <P>The remaining members of staff currently serving in the Department who do not wish to relocate to Killarney will transfer to other Departments remaining in Dublin or to Departments that are scheduled to decentralise to other locations. To date 13 officers have been reassigned to Dublin based posts in other Departments and a further 6 officers have transferred to decentralising Departments in order to relocate to their preferred location. This process will proceed on a phased basis until all officers not transferring to Killarney are transferred to other organisations. While three of the agencies operating under the aegis of my Department have also been selected to decentralise, viz the Sports Council to Killarney, F&aacute;ilte Ireland to Mallow and the Arts Council to Kilkenny, they were not included in the list as early movers.</P>

	<P>Of the 130 posts in my Department that are relocating to Killarney, there is only one specialist post, that of an accountant which is currently vacant. A significant proportion of the post holders in the three organisations under the aegis of my Department that have been designated for decentralisation, i.e. the Sports Council (Killarney), the Arts Council (Kilkenny) and F&aacute;ilte Ireland (Mallow), could be regarded as having specialist skills. While the detailed arrangements associated with the decentralisation process are matters that fall within the responsibilities of the Agencies themselves, I understand that the number of such officers in these organisations who have applied to relocate is small.</P>

I understand that there are 106 cases currently awaiting hearing in County Limerick, the earliest of which was notified to the Tribunal on 23rd June 2005, and that the average waiting period for a hearing is 55 weeks. The Tribunal has scheduled hearings in County Limerick on five separate occasions this year and further hearings are scheduled to take place in the immediate future. I am concerned that such delays in providing the services of the Tribunal have become unduly long and I have asked the Secretary General of my Department to examine the issue in consultation with the Chairperson of the Tribunal and to bring forward proposals for a resolution.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together.</P>
    <P>Data on employment in agency supported companies is recorded at county level. The tabular statement that follows this response gives the figures of full-time jobs created and lost in Co. Louth from 2000 to 2005 in companies supported by the enterprise development agencies. Job creation and job losses are a feature of economic development in all countries as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change. State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. Both Agencies are actively promoting and encouraging new investments and jobs for County Louth and are also working with existing clients in the county with a view to helping them expand and or move their activities up the value chain.</P><Col N="917"/>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s investment in client companies in Co. Louth 2001-2006 (end April) totals almost &euro;10m invested in 190 individual company projects. In addition Enterprise Ireland provides a range of services from technology and HRD support to access to our international office network to facilitate companies intelligence gathering and strategy formulation. The tabular statement that follows this reply gives the totals of payments to Enterprise Ireland client companies between 2001 and 2006, taken at the end of April. While figures are not yet available in respect of 2005, between 2000 and 2004, IDA invested, through grant payments, in excess of twenty two million euro in companies in County Louth. IDA Ireland will continue to actively market County Louth for Foreign Direct Investment. Among its investments in the County are:</P>

<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Its strategic site at Mullagharlin, Dundalk where it is due to invest heavily in capital works during 2006 to make the site available for bio pharma and other process related activities.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">IDA also markets property provided by private developers in the County. In addition, Louth County Enterprise Board (CEB) was established in October 1993 to provide a source of support in the Louth area for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer. From 2000 to 2005 Louth CEB has paid out over &euro;1.4m in grant aid to 172 projects in Co. Louth which has assisted in the creation of 504 jobs in the region. The Board has also organised 128 training programmes over the same period in which 1,536 people participated. I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the Development Agencies in Louth, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Louth.</P><Col N="917"/>

	<P>My Department has been making good progress in implementing its decentralisation programme. The Office of Public Works has completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre. The Office of Public Works, in conjunction with its legal advisers and the National Development Finance Agency, is finalising the documentation which is required in order to seek expressions of interest from developers in relation to the design, build, finance and maintenance of new office accommodation and car parking for the Department in Carlow. The OPW expects to be in a position to commence this stage in the process before the end of May 2006. On completion of this stage, a short-list of developers will be drawn up from whom tenders will be invited. Following the tender evaluation process the preferred tenderer will be requested to seek suitable planning permission. On obtaining this, the OPW will formally award the contract and construction will commence. The OPW expect construction to begin early in 2007 and the construction phase may take up to 24 months. In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are actively exploring the option of an earlier move to Carlow, subject to securing, high quality temporary accommodation. This latter option could allow for the movement of some decentralising staff to Carlow during the first half of next year.</P>
    <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, F&Aacute;S is due to move its head office to Birr, County Offaly. F&Aacute;S is one of the seven State agencies identified as early movers by the Decentralisation Implementation Group from among the 30 agencies covered by the programme. The relocation, involving 383 staff, has a target date for Easter 2009. Negotiations with regard to the purchase of a site for F&Aacute;S in Birr are at contract stage, and are expected to be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that the Headquarters of Enterprise Ireland, including 300 posts, will relocate to Shannon as part of the Decentralisation programme. The most immediate implementation step for Enterprise Ireland is to provide for a new HQ building, designed to meet the business needs of the organisation. Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW), has identified but not yet acquired a preferred site from the submissions received by the OPW in relation to the Shannon location. The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development. In <Col N="920"/>addition, and in co-operation with Shannon Development and OPW, the site was valued and a feasibility study carried out. The site occupies a prime position near the centre of Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure related to the town centre. It is too early to comment definitively on a timescale for the transfer of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s headquarters to Shannon. The factors of significance in this regard will be the acquisition of property and the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants. It will also be affected by progress made at a central level with regard to inter-agency transfers.</P>
    <P>In regard to premises for the Health and Safety Authority in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, site procurement is in the final stages, and based on this, the HSA is estimating that the decentralisation move will take place by end 2008. The Authority is also actively seeking an interim base in Kilkenny city to accommodate circa 25 staff who are in the process of recruitment for the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) strategy and some serving staff who wish to move in advance of the Thomastown premises being available. All staff that may move in the interim to Kilkenny city will transfer to Thomastown when the premises are complete.</P>
    <P>Finally, NSAI are working closely with OPW in identifying and securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area and the NSAI anticipate a target date of April 2009 as the completion date of its decentralisation plan.</P>

	<P>My Department is required to move 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme and has been making good progress in implementing its programme. The Office of Public Works has completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre and is finalising the documentation required to seek expressions of interest from developers in relation to the design, build, finance and maintenance of new office accommodation for the Department in Carlow. Construction is expected to commence in early 2007 and the construction phase may take up to 24 months.</P>
    <P>In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date, my Department is actively exploring the option of an earlier move to Carlow, subject to securing, high quality temporary accommodation. This latter option could allow for the <Col N="921"/>movement of some decentralising staff to Carlow during the first half of next year.</P>
    <P>There are approximately seven specialist skills posts included for relocation to Carlow and the position with regard to these posts is as follows: One Legal Adviser post in my Department is planned for relocation to Carlow. No Legal Adviser from my Department has to date expressed an interest in relocating to Carlow.</P>
    <P>In addition, approximately six I.T. posts will be relocated to Carlow. There are currently two people with specialist I.T. skills who have indicated a willingness to relocate to Carlow. However, a number of staff from elsewhere in the Public Service seeking to decentralise to Carlow have I.T. skills.</P>
    <P>My Department currently has 101 Carlow-bound applicants assigned to decentralising posts and we expect to have all decentralising posts filled in sufficient time to ensure that staff are adequately trained in advance of the move to Carlow.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Agency Decentralisation</i></P>
<P>Four of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise as follows:</P>
    <P LI="1"><i>F&Aacute;S</i> is to move 383 posts to Birr, Co. Offaly;</P>
    <P LI="1"><i>Enterprise Ireland</i> is to move 292 posts to Shannon; </P>
    <P LI="1">The <i>Health and Safety Authority</i> is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, and</P>
    <P LI="1"> The <i>National Standards Authority of Ireland</i> is to move 132 posts to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.</P>
    <P FLI="0"> The following outlines the position regarding the posts of specialists skills for relocation in respect of each agency: </P>
    <P el="10"><i>F&Aacute;S</i></P>
    <P>F&Aacute;S is scheduled to relocate its Head Office to Birr by Easter 2009. 383 F&Aacute;S posts are scheduled for relocation. There is no sub-category for specialist posts.</P>
    <P el="10"><i>Enterprise Ireland</i></P>
    <P>The Government has decided that the Headquarters of Enterprise Ireland, including 300 posts, will relocate to Shannon as part of the Decentralisation programme. Of these posts, some 107 are in the technical and professional grades, while 25 are senior managers in general administrative grades with specialist skills and experience, giving a total of 132 posts in all.</P>
    <P> The most recent information from the CAF indicates that 19 Enterprise Ireland staff have applied for decentralisation to Enterprise Ireland in Shannon. Of these,</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>seven are in technical and professional grades, based in Dublin, and in posts which have been identified for relocation to Shannon;</P><Col N="922"/>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>four are in technical and professional grades and are based outside Dublin and/or in posts that have not been designated for relocation to Shannon.</P>
    <P Italics="Y" el="10">Health and Safety Authority</P>
    <P>All specialist posts based in the Dublin Headquarters of the Health and Safety Authority i.e. inspector positions, are earmarked for decentralisation, but as part of their decentralisation plan the HSA have noted the need to maintain an office in Dublin to service the Dublin region which would require 34 specialists.</P>
    <P>Currently the Authority has approximately 100 inspectors of whom in excess of 60% are based in Dublin. Of these, 7 have applied through CAF (Central Application Facility) to relocate. In addition, a number of specialist posts have also been filled on promotion on the basis of the final location of the post being Thomastown. 9 new inspectors have been recruited on the basis that their eventual location will be Thomastown.</P>
    <P>In addition new staff in the course of recruitment for REACH (Registration Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) will be based in Thomastown.</P>
    <P Italics="Y" el="10">NSAI</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation the National Standards Authority of Ireland, a total 132 staff are to be relocated to Arklow. NSAI has 74 posts of specialist skills planned for relocation under the decentralisation move to Arklow.</P>
    <P>Currently 8 holders of these specialist posts have expressed their willingness to transfer with their posts to Arklow.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if, in view of the fact that income bands for deserted wives benefit have not been increased since 1992 he proposes to increase the bands and thus address this anomaly.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20104/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>An earnings limit was introduced for <Col N="923"/>deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit in 1992. The limit, which applied only to new claims after August 1992, was set at EUR12,697.38 a year (gross earnings). Where earnings are in excess of EUR12,697.38 a year, there may be entitlement to a reduced rate of payment of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit, provided gross earnings do not exceed EUR17,776.33 a year. Following the introduction of the one parent family payment in 1997, the deserted wives benefit scheme was discontinued with effect from 2 January in that year. However, existing entitlements already acquired in August 1992, when the earnings limit was introduced for new claimants, and in 1997, when the one parent family payment scheme was introduced, have been preserved. The upper income ceiling applying to deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit of EUR17,776.33 (gross) in 1997 has not changed since then and I consider that it remains appropriate to the scheme.</P>
    <P>With over 80,000 unmarried and separated parents with caring responsibilities receiving support under the one parent family payment, I was glad to be able to increase the earnings ceiling for the one parent family payment in this year&rsquo;s budget from EUR293.00 per week to EUR375.00 per week or EUR19,500 a year (gross earnings). Recipients of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit with dependent children may transfer to the one parent family payment if it is beneficial for them to do so. In March of this year, I launched a major Government discussion paper, &lsquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents&rsquo; which addresses the social exclusion and risk of poverty faced by low income families and their children. The report puts forward radical proposals for reform of the income support system for all parents on a low income. The report proposes the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of childcare, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new Parental Allowance for low income families with young children. A range of views has been expressed as this report is debated and I will give serious consideration to all of them. As soon as I am convinced that we have reached conclusions that are workable and equitable, it will be my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in the course of this year.</P>

    <P>Under the Government decentralisation programme announced in Budget 2004, this Department is due to decentralise all of its Dublin based headquarters sections, involving some 1,300 staff, to six locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Only a limited number of posts will remain in Dublin. In addition, the Combat Poverty Agency and Comhairle, agencies under the aegis of the Department, will be relocated to Monaghan and Drogheda, respectively.</P>
    <P>The following are the indicative construction start and finish dates for each of the locations to which the Department will be moving:</P>

    <P FLI="0">To date, 20 staff have been relocated to Sligo under the programme. All of the posts were filled by applicants on the Central Application Facility (CAF). 24 staff have been assigned to Sections that are due to decentralise early next year and a further 215 people have accepted offers of transfer under the programme. The CAF will remain open for new applications until the full decentralisation programme is complete.</P>
    <P>There are currently 22 professional/specialist skill posts in this Department and a number of such posts in the agencies under its aegis that are due to decentralise. None of the staff currently employed in these positions has indicated an interest in decentralising in their current role.</P>
    <P>To date, no-one serving in another decentralising Department/Office, who has opted to remain in Dublin, has been re-assigned to this Department. According to information available to the Department from the CAF, 1,549 staff in this Department have not applied to relocate outside Dublin. However, in view of the normal on-going turnover of staff, it is not anticipated that a surplus of Dublin staff will arise in the short-to-medium term. In the event of surplus arising, it will be dealt with in accordance with the agreed arrangements.</P>

	<P>The Kildare Route Project involves the four-tracking of a critical section of the Kildare line between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch. The project will allow separation of long distance and commuter <Col N="927"/>services and improve speed and capacity for commuter, regional and intercity services.</P>
    <P>Having completed detailed planning and design, CI&Eacute; applied for a Railway Order in October of 2005. I received the Inspector&rsquo;s report of the public inquiry in relation to the Railway Order for the Kildare Route Project on Friday 5 May 2006 and the report was published on 23rd May 2006. It is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.transport.ie</i>.</P>
    <P>In making my decision as to the granting of the Railway Order, I am obliged under Section 43 (1) of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001, to consider the report of the Inquiry as well as the submissions I received in respect of the project, CI&Eacute;&rsquo;s application for a Railway Order, and the draft Order and documents that accompanied the application. I am currently considering the inspector&rsquo;s report and the other documents mentioned above and I will make a decision in the matter when I have completed that consideration.</P>
    <P>Subject to the outcome of the Railway Order process, construction work on the project will begin towards the end of 2006 and is due for completion at the end of 2010.</P>
    <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has made no changes to their plans for upgrading the route.</P>
    <P>Transport 21 includes a financial provision to cover the projected cost of this project. However, I do not propose to release this commercially sensitive information until the public procurement process for this project is completed.</P>

	<P>The contract with National Car Testing Service Limited (NCTS) provides for a mid-term review of the service by the Minister after the mid-point of the 10-year car testing contract. The purpose of the mid-term review is to review, in detail, the performance of NCTS and assess a range of strategic issues including the location and number of NCT test centres, the content of the test, the quality of the service, and the responses to a public consultation process on the review. The review was carried out by Pricewaterhouse Coopers for my Department last year and their report is currently being considered by my officials. I expect shortly to be in a position to make a decision on the report.</P>
    <P>As part of the car-testing contract, NCTS operates a complaints and appeals procedure for customers aggrieved by a decision on a test. This procedure includes provision for an appeal against the result of a test. The grievance procedure was enhanced in 2004 with the introduction of a fully independent appeals procedure for considering unresolved complaints that have exhausted the internal NCTS appeals machinery. The independent assessment of appeals is carried out by the Automobile Association. In addition, it is open to a car owner to appeal a decision of NCTS to refuse a test certificate for a vehicle to the District Court, which may either refuse the appeal or direct that a new test be carried out.</P>
    <P>The original contract provided for the Company to carry out periodic roadworthiness testing on passenger cars (including small public service vehicles). Subsequently, the contract was modified to include the carrying out of suitability tests on vehicles for the purposes of licensing as small public service vehicles. In accordance with the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, the regulation of small public service vehicles is now the responsibility of the Commission for Taxi Regulation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Traffic Acts establish a range of offences and penalties that can be applied for breaches of legislation. These range from the payment of a fixed charge or an on-the-spot-fine in respect of specified offences in lieu of court proceedings, to a fine, imprisonment or driver disqualification on <Col N="931"/>conviction in Court. I have received no proposals for adding to the Road Traffic Acts other types of penalties for road traffic offences.</P>
    <P>The extent to which driver retraining or rehabilitation may be applied by the Courts, in addition to the types of penalty mentioned above, is a matter for the Courts.</P>

	<P>The intention is to fully upgrade the IT delivery of the driver testing service over the coming 18 to 24 months. The first step is the improvement of the IT infrastructure to underpin the business needs of the Road Safety Authority (RSA). The RSA will have responsibility for the driver testing service, for which a sum of &euro;380,000 has been provided for the 2006 costs associated with this upgrade.</P>
    <P>In the context of the establishment of the RSA, detailed needs assessments will be carried out and an overall project cost will be established on this basis.</P>

    <P>Of the 140 posts due to transfer to Knock Airport, some 65 will transfer to temporary accommodation in Tubbercurry from mid-2006.

	<P>On 12 August 2004, the person named submitted an application under Category B of the Force Majeure provisions of the Single Payment Scheme. Category B provides for those farmers who suffered long term professional incapacity. Having examined the circumstances and documentation submitted, it was deemed that the application did not satisfy the criteria laid down in Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, determining Force Majeure/Exceptional Circumstances. The person named was notified of this decision on 31 August 2004. On 9 September 2004, the person named appealed this decision to the Single Payment Appeals Committee. Following consideration by that Committee, the person named was informed on 4 November 2004, that the appeal was disallowed. Subsequently, on receipt of further documentation from the person named, the case was again reviewed. However, it was determined that there were no grounds to change the original decision.</P>
    <P>The person named was notified accordingly and advised of the right to appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman if dissatisfied with this decision. The person named did approach the Office of the Ombudsman. That Office reviewed the case and advised the person named on 21 November 2005 that the case was considered closed. The person named also submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the Single Payments Scheme National Reserve, under category D. Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December <Col N="936"/>2002, or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year. The person named did not satisfy the criteria for an allocation of entitlements under National Reserve as he commenced farming in 2002 and received direct payments from my Department in respect of that year.</P>
    <P>Following this decision the person named submitted an appeal to my Department enclosing additional documentary evidence in support of his application. My Department will now re-examine the National Reserve application in light of the new evidence provided and if the original decision is unchanged following this re-examination, the case will then be forwarded to the Single Payments Appeals Committee, who will carry out a review of the case. The person named will be notified of the outcome.</P>

My Department&rsquo;s provision to Teagasc for capital and non-capital purposes in 2006 amounts to &euro;133m. The amount for non-capital purposes is &euro;129m and for capital development purposes the allocation is &euro;5m. By any standards these are substantial resources and are a clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to supporting Teagasc activities. It is the responsibility of the Teagasc Authority to prioritise activities and to allocate its funding accordingly. This it has done over the years in accordance with the needs of clients, EU and Government policy and industry needs. I am satisfied that in doing so it has provided a first class service to Irish farmers. Any request for extra resources will be dealt with in the usual manner.</P>

	<P>The EU provides part-financing for national apiculture programmes carried out in Member States. EU funding for Ireland&rsquo;s programmes amounted to &euro;88,500 in the period from 2001 to 2005. These funds were used towards the analysis of beekeepers&rsquo; samples for varroa disease and on research on the varroa mite, Irish honey analysis, the purchase of equipment for the Federation of Irish Beekeepers&rsquo; Association and the publication of educational literature. In 2003, some training costs of FIBKA certified lecturers, who travel throughout the country disseminating information to beekeeping associations on various aspect of beekeeping, were also paid.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application requesting consideration in respect of the New Entrant measure of the Single Payment Scheme. However, as his lands had been leased out since 1996 he had established no entitlements during the reference years 2000-2002, and therefore his application was unsuccessful. In addition, the person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the Single Payments Scheme National Reserve under category D. Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year. This case has been processed to completion and the person named has now been granted an allocation. A formal letter setting out the details of this allocation has been issued. If the person named is dissatisfied with my Department&rsquo;s decision he will have the opportunity to appeal the decision to the Independent Appeals Committee. An appeals application is available from any of my Department&rsquo;s offices or on the Department website at <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie</i>.</P>

     <QRef>[20356/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the general thrust of the proposed Regulation on organic production and labelling of organic products and I believe that it is a step in the right direction towards the simplification of controls and procedures. There have <Col N="940"/>been extensive discussions at Council Working Group level during the current Presidency. The proposed Regulation was debated at the Council of Ministers this week and while no decision was sought there was broad general agreement among the Ministers on the approach being adopted by the Commission. A number of areas remain to be clarified.</P>
    <P>In relation to the setting of organic standards being controlled by the European Commission, the existing practice is that this work is done by a regulatory committee comprised of experts from the Member States. I am not in favour of the proposal to replace this regulatory committee with a Management Committee. The majority of my fellow Ministers take the same view. On the other hand, I fully support the harmonisation of organic standards throughout the EU. Under the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, claims that a particular set of private or national standards is superior to the rules laid down in the Regulation will not be allowed. That will of course not affect the right of a member state to set additional standards, as Ireland has already done.</P>
    <P>The proposed Regulation continues to prohibit the deliberate use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in organic production and processing, and that products cannot be labelled both <Col N="941"/>organic and GMO. I fully support this position. While organic farming prohibits the deliberate use of GMOs, there is some risk that they may be introduced unintentionally to organic crops from time to time as a result of events over which producers have no control. The existing horizontal Regulations regarding the labelling of food and feed state that a product with an adventitious presence of GMO of more than 0.9% must be labelled as GM. The draft Regulation on organic production proposes to adopt the same threshold. While a final decision on this issue must involve some degree of pragmatism, the actual threshold for GMO in organic food is a matter that the Council will consider further. As far as certification controls are concerned, I am happy that the existing system works well in Ireland and I do not support unnecessary changes. Detailed implementing rules will be finalised before the proposed new Regulation comes into effect in January 2009. The issue of a precise list of items will be discussed in that context.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to his Question No. 412 of 16 May 2006 in connection with the person in question. An Irish visa merely allows a person to travel to the State, it does not grant permission to enter the State or to remain in the State. A &lsquo;C&rsquo; visa merely indicates that the holder may remain for up to a maximum of 90 days in the State. A &lsquo;C&rsquo; visa was granted to the person in question to enable her to travel to the State to pursue an application for permission to remain in the State based on marriage to an Irish citizen. In this regard, an application for permission to remain in the State based on marriage to an Irish national was received from the person concerned in March 2006. Applications of this type, in fairness to all other such applicants, are dealt with in strict chronological order and currently take approximately fourteen months to process. Marriage to an Irish national does not grant any automatic right to residency in the State solely on that basis. Neither does it grant an automatic right to Irish citizenship following the coming into force of the Immigration and Citizenship Act 2001 which abolished the previous system of Post Nuptial Citizenship.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Irish Nationality and Immigration Service of my Department has growing experience of marriages being entered into for the sole purpose of enabling the non-national in question gain entry to the State. Frequently in these circumstances the Irish national may be totally unaware that this is the primary intention of the non-national and will feel aggrieved by the perception that the immigration authorities are interfering with their private life in refusing to allow their spouse to enter or remain in the State. On occasion the Irish national may be a willing party for their own personal benefit. &ldquo;Convenience&rdquo; <Col N="943"/>marriages for the purpose of circumventing normal immigration controls are experienced by immigration jurisdictions worldwide and, in this regard, holiday and internet romances would feature frequently. In order to prevent abuses of the system, in so far as is possible and without unduly interfering with the Irish citizen&rsquo;s private circumstances, the Immigration Division will seek to establish various matters. These include the context in which the marriage took place, the validity of the marriage and whether the couple are residing in a family unit. This may involve requesting supporting documentation as evidence of the relationship or an interview by the immigration authorities of either or both parties. No further period of legal residency will be granted to the person concerned until the application for leave to remain based on marriage to an Irish national is fully considered.</P>

	<P>The requirement to hold a valid visa prior to entering the State was waived in recent years for certain persons travelling from Belarus with Chernobyl childrens&rsquo; organisations. This practice was discontinued on 1st January, 2006. Changes in visa policy and the introduction of legislation including the Children Act, 2001 and the Immigration Act, 2003, necessitated a return to previous practice in relation to issue of visas. However, an interim arrangement currently exists for one long established group to continue to operate under the visa waiver scheme. It is envisaged that the arrangement with this group will cease to operate on 31st December, 2006.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a key issue to be addressed in the installation of the Finglas Town Centre CCTV system is the provision of suitable accommodation to house the monitoring equipment. It was initially hoped that this could be accommodated in Finglas Garda station. However, the present station premises are not suitable for this purpose. I have already stated that immediate priority is being given to providing a new Garda station in Finglas. I am advised that the Office of Public Works are cur<Col N="944"/>rently in negotiations with the owners of a local premises with a view to leasing the necessary accommodation for the monitoring of the CCTV cameras in Finglas until such time as the proposed new Station is built. I can assure the Deputy that this project will be progressed as soon as humanly possible.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government Road Safety Strategy for the period 2004-2006 proposes that 11.1 million vehicle speeding checks be carried out per year by the end of the Strategy. In order to enable this target to be achieved, the Strategy proposes that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enter into arrangements for the engagement of a private sector concern for the purpose of the provision and operation of a nationwide programme for the detection of speeding offences.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Transport and I presented proposals to Government in July 2005 for the outsourcing to the private sector of the provision and operation of speed cameras under the supervision and direction of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Our proposals were accepted by Government. The proposals will require the introduction of changes to the current Road Traffic Acts. The Department of Transport is currently preparing legislative provisions necessary to support those recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the safety camera project will commence with approximately 500 &mdash; 600 locations countrywide (about 15-20 locations per local authority area). Speed checks will take place at these locations at times decided by a matrix which will link the checks to speed related collision data. The number of locations will be increased as necessary to achieve the targeted road safety objectives of increasing compliance with speed limits across the entire road network, reducing the speed of vehicles at locations that have a speed related collision history and acting as a deterrent to driving at excessive speed. A mix of mobile and fixed cameras will be used.</P>
    <P>I am confident that adequate funding will be provided to implement the project. To retain public support for the safety camera project there will be no linkage to the revenue that may be collected as fixed charges or court fines. The project will focus on its primary objective of reducing<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="945"/><?oasys _fc ?>excessive speed and thereby reducing death and serious injury.</P>

    <P FLI="0">It should be noted that the necessity for a disproportionately large Garda presence in the border counties has significantly diminished since the Good Friday Agreement. Notwithstanding this, Garda management advise that an additional 10 Garda&iacute; are due to be allocated to the Louth/ Meath Division in conjunction with the next allocation of Probationer Garda&iacute; on 9 June 2006.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
    <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, <Col N="946"/>of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will do so every 90 days thereafter. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of County Louth will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commissioners were appointed by the President on the 10th February 2006, following nomination by the Government and recommendations by both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Commission is in a preparatory stage at present. I understand that the initial work of the Commission has involved study visits to their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK and initial meetings with the various stakeholders involved in the Garda complaints system, such as Garda management, the Garda representative bodies and officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>This process is aimed at enabling the Commission to establish principles regarding its approach to investigating complaints and to work on the development of operational protocols with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Consultations are also on-going between the Commissioners, my Department and the Department of Finance in regard to staffing matters. The Commission is aiming to be in a position to receive complaints as soon as possible in 2007.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to directly and independently investigate complaints against members of the Force. It may also refer complaints to the Garda Commissioner for investigation with or without supervision. The Ombuds<Col N="950"/>man Commission is empowered to investigate any matter, even where no complaint has been made, where it appears that a Garda may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings. It is also empowered to investigate any practice, policy or procedure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to reducing the incidence of related complaints. The Ombudsman Commission can also have complaints referred to them from either myself or the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate the number of complaints which the Ombudsman Commission will receive, but the last figure that the Garda Complaints Board have given, in their 2005 annual report, has shown that they received a total of 1173 complaints in that year. It will be a matter for the Ombudsman Commission to determine the number of complaints which they will investigate directly and the number they will refer to the Garda Commissioner for investigation. Sections 77, 78 and 79 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 sets out the procedures governing the Commission&rsquo;s accountability to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee and the Oireachtas. As the Commission is funded by my Department, the Secretary General of the Department, as Accounting Officer, is accountable for such expenditure through all the usual mechanisms of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts.</P>

	<P>The position is that the great-grandchild of a person born in Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship by registering in the Foreign Births Register provided either of his/her parents was an Irish citizen at the time of his/her birth. There is one exception to that rule. If the child&rsquo;s parent had registered in the Foreign Births Register prior to 31 December, 1986, the person can register even if the parent had not registered at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth.</P>
    <P>In this particular case, the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question registered in the Foreign Births Register in 2004 on the basis of having a grandparent born in Ireland. However, as he did not exercise his entitlement to Irish citizenship prior to the birth of his children, and was not therefore an Irish citizen at the time of their births, the children are not entitled to register. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended was enacted by the Oireachtas, and the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs are obliged to administer it. A challenge to the constitutionality or otherwise of the Act, would be a matter to be settled by the Irish courts. A reply is due to issue shortly to the letter received from the person concerned.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my Reply to his D&aacute;il Question No. 165 of 11 May 2006. The position in the State of the person concerned remains as set out in that Reply.</P>
    <P>Representations for temporary leave to remain in the State pursuant to Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) were submitted on behalf of the person concerned by the Refugee Legal Service and from various third parties and were duly considered before a decision was taken to issue a Deportation Order in his case. As I have previously advised, the enforcement of such an Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. These representations were not considered by either the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) as these representations were submitted only after the asylum claims of the person concerned had been independently refused by both of those bodies. The Deputy should note also that the statutory brief of both of those bodies, as set out in the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) is to examine asylum claims, at first instance in the context of the ORAC and, on appeal, in the context of the RAT, and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in each individual case, as to whether each applicant should or should not be declared to be a refugee. The person concerned had his asylum claims examined by both bodies, both of whom concluded that he did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The Deputy will appreciate that these bodies are not charged with responsibility for considering applications for permission <Col N="953"/>to remain in the State pursuant to the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Deputy should note that the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory body, independent in the performance of its functions under the provisions of sections 15 and 16 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended). The effective management of the Tribunal is the responsibility of the Chairperson who in accordance with the section 14 of the second schedule of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) shall endeavour to ensure that the business of the Tribunal is managed efficiently and that the business assigned to each division is disposed of as expeditiously as may be consistent with fairness and natural justice. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my many previous and comprehensive Replies in this matter. As previously stated, the persons concerned arrived in the State on 7 March 2005 and 1 July 2005 and applied for asylum. Their applications were refused following the consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. As the Deputy is aware, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is a statutory body, independent in the performance of its functions, in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended). Similarly the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory body, independent in the performance of its functions, in accordance with the provisions of sections 15 and 16 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended).</P>
    <P>The persons concerned, following refusal recommendations by both the ORAC and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on their asylum applications, were informed, by letters dated 27 September 2005 and 16 January 2006, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them and afforded them three options under Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of deportation orders or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain <Col N="954"/>temporarily in the State i.e. why they should not be deported.</P>
    <P>Their cases were examined having regard for the eleven factors specified in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), including consideration of representations for temporary leave to remain in the State lodged on their behalf by their legal representatives. Their cases were also considered having regard for the provisions of Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Refoulement, in essence, relates to the safety of returning a person to their country of origin. After their cases had been comprehensively assessed under all the relevant headings, on 27 February 2006, I signed Deportation Orders in respect of the persons concerned. Notice of the Deportation Orders was served by registered post requiring the persons concerned to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on Thursday 9 March 2006 in order to make arrangements for their deportation from the State. The persons concerned failed to present themselves on that occasion, as required, and were thus classified as evading their deportation. They should, therefore, present themselves to the GNIB without delay. The effect of these Deportation Orders is that the persons concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.</P>
    <P>The asylum claims and the applications for temporary leave to remain in the State made by the persons concerned have been considered comprehensively and fairly. Consequently I see no reason to alter my decision to issue Deportation Orders in these cases. The enforcement of the Deportation Orders remains an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>The lady in question arrived in the State on 30 May 1999 and sought asylum. She withdrew her application before a decision was reached and sought permission to remain on foot of her parentage of a child born in Ireland on 16 June 1999. Such permission was granted in November 1999.</P>
    <P>The husband of the lady in question arrived in the State in November 1999 and also sought asylum. That application was refused in September 2000. An appeal was lodged in October 2000 but was subsequently withdrawn. Permission to remain on foot of his parentage of the child born in Ireland on 16 June 1999 was granted in November 2001.</P>
    <P>Both of the persons in question initially applied for naturalisation in 2002. I considered the applications in 2004 and decided to refuse both applications. The persons concerned were informed of my decision at the end of 2004. Both submitted new applications in August 2005.</P>
    <P>The first element of the assessment process involves determining if the applicant meets the statutory residency requirement set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled, including having had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years. In the context of naturalisation certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>At the time of her application, the lady in question did not have the necessary reckonable residence as set out above. She was informed of this determination in December 2005 and given a copy of my officials&rsquo; calculations. It appears that she now meets the residency requirement.</P>
    <P>The lady&rsquo;s husband did not have the necessary reckonable residence at the time he applied for naturalisation. However, it appears that he will not meet the residency requirement until October 2006.</P>
    <P>Any further applications by the couple will be assessed against the statutory criteria in operation at the time of receipt of the applications. The legal representatives of the persons in question <Col N="956"/>have submitted documentation in relation to a medical situation in the family. I will, of course, take these matters into account in considering future applications from the couple.</P>

Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>It must also be noted that the last correspondence received on behalf of the person concerned was in November, 2004. In the circumstances, the Deputy may wish to note that a letter recently issued to the person concerned giving her the opportunity to make further representations on her own behalf. Once these representations have been received, an assessment of her case as it currently stands can be made.</P>

    <P>The person was arrested on suspicion of commission of an offence contrary to Section 26 Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 and charged with the offence of possession of a false instrument. He pleaded guilty before Kilmainham District Court and was fined &euro;100.</P>
    <P>The Family Reunification application by the person in question was refused and their legal representative was notified of this decision on the 10 February 2005.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the person concerned was naturalised in August 2004 and became an Irish citizen at that time. Under Section 18 of the Refugee Act, 1996 only refugees may apply to have family members join them in the State. As such the person in question has no longer any entitlement to make an application for Family Reunification.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the case of the person concerned falls under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003. Consequently, I wish to preface my Reply by briefly explaining the workings of this Regulation.</P>
    <P>The Dublin II Regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of &lsquo;asylum shopping&rsquo; across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one State. At the same time it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of &lsquo;refugees in orbit&rsquo;, a situation which had pertained in Europe prior to the introduction in 1995 of its predecessor, namely the Dublin Convention. Under the Dublin Convention, and now the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) can, on the basis of relevant criteria, request another State to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other State.</P>
    <P>The person concerned lodged an asylum claim in this State on 13 April 2005. Following investigation, it was determined by the ORAC that, pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, the United Kingdom was the appropriate State to process the application as the person concerned had previously lodged an asylum claim in that State, on 4 March 2003, albeit under a different name and date of birth. The person concerned was offered an opportunity to appeal the <Col N="959"/>determination of the ORAC, to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which she duly did on 7 July 2005. Following consideration of the Appeal, the Tribunal upheld the determination of the ORAC i.e. that the person concerned should have her asylum claim examined in the United Kingdom and she was formally notified of this decision by letter dated 8 September, 2005. The person concerned was kept informed of developments throughout the course of her asylum application in this State and was made aware as soon as it was possible to do so that her case came under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom accepted responsibility for the case of the person concerned with the consequence that a Transfer Order was signed in respect of her on 29 June 2005. This Order was issued to the person concerned on 1 July 2005, requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 11 July 2005 to make arrangements for her transfer to the United Kingdom. She failed to present, as required, and is therefore classified as having evaded her transfer. Consequently, she is now liable to arrest and detention. She should therefore present herself to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without further delay so that travel arrangements can be made to effect her transfer to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, the United Kingdom, and not Ireland, is responsible for examining the asylum claim of the person concerned. As a result, it is not my intention to grant the person concerned any period of leave to reside here. Given that the person concerned lodged her initial asylum claim in the United Kingdom, it is entirely appropriate that she be transferred to that State.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 to 255, inclusive, and 257 together.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s decentralisation programme runs from 2005 to 2009 and involves the transfer of over 900 posts from agencies and units under the aegis of my Department to seven locations around the country. To date, in respect of these 900 posts, 251 people have either transferred to the organisations concerned or have indicated a willingness to move to the decentralised locations. There are a range of posts which can be described as non-general service grades and to date, seven people have applied to move with their posts. Due to the varying timescales involved in my Department&rsquo;s programme and the fact that the Central Applications Facility remains open for business, these figures will be subject to change as the programme is rolled out. I fully anticipate that the numbers will rise as the programme develops.</P>
    <P>At this stage in the implementation of the programme, the emphasis has been on the &ldquo;early movers&rdquo;, namely the transfer of the Irish Prison Service to Longford, as well as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to Portarlington and sections of Garda Headquarters to Thurles. In the course of this particular exercise, 103 officers have opted to remain in Dublin, 43 of whom have been assigned and 60 people are in the process of being re-assigned within my Department.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the precise timetable for my Department&rsquo;s decentralisation programme has been published in the most recent Report from the Decentralisation Implementation Group to the Minister for Finance, dated 30th June 2005. I am pleased to report that all these moves are on target and, indeed, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will now move to Portarlington before the end of 2006 instead of in 2008. The Private Security Authority <Col N="964"/>has, of course, been operational in Tipperary Town since October, 2004.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that there has already been an advance move of the Garda Central Vetting Unit to Thurles in November 2005. Other advance moves to Thurles are also planned for this year which will bring the total number of posts in Thurles up to almost one hundred.</P>
    <P>As regards assignments, the following table sets out the assignments to-date, together with the promotion and recruitment statistics.</P>

The unit referred to by the Deputies which is designed to cater for up to 12 pupils was completed in 2003. Such an enrolment would attract a staffing allocation of 2 full time teachers and 4 Special Needs Assistants. Officials in my Department are liaising between the BOM of the school, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and the Health Services Executive (HSE) to progress the opening of the unit. Staffing ratios, the provision of appropriate therapies by the HSE, grant aid to address administration costs are amongst the issues under active negotiation.</P>

    <P>Any teacher under age 66 appointed prior to 6 April, 1995, who paid PRSI contributions at the Class D rate and resigns from their teaching post shall on return be liable for PRSI contributions at the Class A rate. In accordance with Department of Social and Family Affairs regulations, teachers over the age of 66 pay contributions at Class J rate. There are a small group of Eligible <Col N="966"/>Part-Time teachers who commenced employment prior to the sixth April, 1995 and who have continuous service since, who are liable for PRSI contributions at the Class A rate pending appointment in a permanent capacity. There is a requirement for this group to pay PRSI contributions at the Class D rate on appointment to a permanent full time post provided that there is no break in their service.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.</P>
    <P>In 2004 my Department initiated the Summer Works Scheme as a devolved method for carrying out refurbishment works on a phased basis in schools during the summer holiday periods. The Scheme has been extremely successful and has received very positive feedback from school management authorities. To date, almost 2,000 projects at a total cost of &euro;184.2 million have been delivered under this scheme. Notwithstanding this success, my Department is conscious of the additional burden that the phasing of projects under the Summer Works Scheme can place on school communities. In response to this, this <Col N="967"/>year&rsquo;s circular on the scheme states that &ldquo;Schools that have projects approved under the Summer Works Scheme in more than one year will have the amount of local contribution required capped at the relevant maximum level of &euro;31,500 (or &euro;12,500 for special or disadvantaged primary schools) over a rolling 5 year period&rdquo;.</P><?oasys _cl11- ?>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if there are currently supports available either from her Department or any other Departments to support wind energy programmes in schools that would complement environment works currently taking place under green flag initiatives; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has no specific programme currently in place for wind generation by Schools. It would encourage schools to consider the use of wind generated electricity which is available nationally through the National Grid. This in effect allows the school to benefit from the environmental and lower cost benefits of wind generated electricity without being exposed to operating and maintenance issues and reliability of supply.</P>
    <P>My Department is reviewing renewable options for energy generation in schools through a number of research projects including, Tory wind turbine project, Interreg solar hot water heating projects and Biomass wood pellet / wood chip boiler and solar projects. The Tory Island project involves the supply and installation of two wind turbines to provide electrical energy to serve the existing community facility and Vocational School situated on Tory Island.</P>
    <P>With respect to energy programmes that would complement environmental work currently taking place under the green flags initiative for the past eight years the Planning and Building Unit within my Department have been using a process called the DART approach (Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology) to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings. The policy is driven by technical guidance documents, informed by building unit professional and technical staff, external partnerships and updated by continued energy research and development.</P>
    <P>Rather than develop a unique focus on energy design my Department has taken a more holistic approach and have developed their technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as <Col N="968"/>an integral part of the suite of technical guidance documents. These guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception is encouraged. The incorporation of low energy design has been done on a hybrid basis by maximising natural resources and utilising technologies. This involves focusing on areas such as natural ventilation, passive solar design, day lighting and reducing infiltration, enhanced insulation, lighting and heating controls and water efficiency.</P>
    <P>The focus to date on sustainability in schools has been to reduce the energy demand in schools. This has proven quite successful with modern day schools typically using three times less energy than schools built ten years ago and also using less than half the energy than what is termed as good international practice for schools.</P>

As part of that announcement, I indicated that I had deferred a decision in relation to three other schools including the one to which the Deputy refers. My Department is in correspondence with the patron about a matter of concern raised by the New Schools Advisory Committee relating to the possible impact on enrolment in an existing school of similar type in the same general area as the proposed interim accommodation for the school referred to. As soon as these matters have been fully considered I will announce my decision on the application.</P>

	<P>A decision will be made on the application to establish a new Gaelscoil in West Wicklow by the end of the month. The reason the decision was deferred at the time that the list of <Col N="969"/>new schools was announced was to allow for consideration of the impact that recognising this school would have on the existing schools in Blessington, plans for the expansion of which are well advanced. The New Schools Advisory Committee recommended in their report to me that this issue be considered. The Chairperson of the Commission on School Accommodation is carrying out a review and further analysis of key data in relation to the population projections for the Blessington area and this will be completed by the end of the month. I am very conscious of the need for a decision to be made as soon as possible so that parents know what the situation will be for September and that is why I have put a deadline on issuing one.</P>

At post primary level, there are enough spare places in the existing second level schools in the vicinity of Shankill to accommodate all students from Shankill for the foreseeable future. The schools in Bray, Loughlinstown and Cabinteely are just a very short bus journey from Shankill, on the 7, 45, 45A and 84 bus routes and indeed many students from Shankill walk or cycle to these schools also. The all-girls' schools in Rockford Manor and Sion Hill have always served the Shankill area and have the capacity to continue to do so. Rockford Manor can be reached by the 45 bus, while Sion Hill is easily reached by both DART and bus services from Shankill.</P>
    <P>Whether or not a new school is provided in any given area depends on the availability of places in the existing schools in that area and whether future population growth is likely to require more places than are available. The 2002 census showed that the population of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown electoral area grew by just 0.9% as a whole between 1996 and 2002, with some parts of the area growing considerably while other parts showed a marked decline in population. The population of the area is also getting older. To date there have been plenty of places available both in the existing primary schools and in the second level schools in the vicinity of Shankill to accommodate the increase in the number of people of school going age in the Shankill area, and given the number of spare places available in these schools this is likely to be the case for some time.</P><Col N="970"/>
    <P>Obviously the development of Cherrywood and the Rathmichael area will create demand in the future which will have to be considered. My Department will continue to closely monitor population statistics for Shankill and other parts of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown to ensure that any new schools that might be required will be put in place in good time.</P>

	<P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.</P>
    <P>The revised staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year (Circular 0023/2006) has been issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30th September, 2005 was 248 pupils. On the basis of this figure, the mainstream staffing for the 2006/07 school year will be a Principal and 9 mainstream class teachers.</P>
    <P>Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as <Col N="975"/>developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
    <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule circular. They are also available in Circular 0024/2006 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>The first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held on the 25 May, 2006. Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2006. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 12 May, 24 June and 18 October respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.</P>

     <Quest>the number of incidents of school bullying reported in each of the past five years; the action taken arising therefrom; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Individual school management authorities are not required to report to my Department on incidents of bullying. Therefore, the information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy of my concern that any child would feel upset in school because of bullying &mdash; be it physical, verbal or cyber and am anxious that all schools have effective practices in place both to prevent bullying and to deal with cases that may arise.</P>
    <P>Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consul<Col N="976"/>tation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
    <P>My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school. My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education has also developed Policy Guidelines and Advisory Notes for schools and parents which deal with the issues of internet and mobile phone bullying.</P>
    <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is at present developing further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. The process involves the drawing up of a draft framework/discussion document for the guidelines, which is being used as a basis for consultations with the key stakeholders including school management, teachers, parents, and children. The Board has established an expert working group for this purpose. Work on the guidelines is at an advanced stage and is envisaged that implementation will commence in the next school year.</P>
    <P>Once the NEWB Guidelines are in place, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own &ldquo;Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour&rdquo;. This review will take into account issues such as legislative developments, the involvement of the support services available to schools, technological advancements such as use of the Internet, e-mail, mobile phones and camera phones and the latest developments in International best practice on dealing with bullying behaviour.</P>
    <P>These guidelines, on top of those that are already in place, will provide vital guidance for schools in fulfilling their responsibilities in relation to this issue. The Deputy may also be interested to know that dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme. I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the develop<Col N="977"/>ment of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying.</P>
    <P>So, while responsibility for tackling bullying naturally falls to the level of the individual school, a wide range of measures are in place to support schools in this area.</P>

	<P>The safety of children travelling on the school transport service has been top of my agenda since coming into office. I have effected a range of measures to improve the quality and safety of school transport services both in the vicinity and on school buses. In January, 2005, I launched a Warning Flashing Light Project on 22 buses in Ennis, Co. Clare. In July, 2005, Minister Hanafin and myself announced a package of measures to enhance the safety of school transport operations. The measures included: the phasing out of &ldquo;3 for 2&rdquo; seating on post-primary services by end December, 2005; the phasing out of &ldquo;3 for 2&rdquo; seating on primary services by end December, 2006; the acquisition of additional buses by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the hiring in of additional private vehicles to meet the consequential capacity shortfall; and the immediate fitting of seat belts on the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus fleet and setting a target date of December, 2006 for private buses in the scheme to be fitted with approved seat belts.</P>
    <P>To ensure ongoing safety and roadworthiness, my colleague, the Minister for Transport has requested an independent review to be carried out within Bus &Eacute;ireann of the arrangements and systems in place for the management, operation and maintenance of the fleet, both owned and contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann. I understand that Minister Cullen has requested that the review be completed, as soon as possible and that a copy of the report be forwarded to him as soon as it is available. Separately, the Minister for Transport has requested the Chief Executive designate of the proposed Road Safety Authority to undertake a fundamental review of the arrangements for the compulsory periodic roadworthiness testing of goods vehicles and buses. As part of that review, the matter of Bus &Eacute;ireann undertaking such roadworthiness tests on their own vehicles will be examined. Officials of my Department will liaise with the Department of Transport regarding the outcome of the review.</P>

	<P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. However, if the Deputy wishes to request details on a specific school, my officials will provide the required information.</P>
    <P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
    <P>The focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary/prefabricated accommodation at primary level and to upgrade existing facilities, two new initiatives, the Permanent Accommodation Initiative and the Small School Initiative, were launched in 2003 on a pilot basis. The purpose of these initiatives was to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money as opposed to the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included. In order to maintain this momentum I have invited 210 schools to participate in these schemes in 2006. As a result of these initiatives the amount spent on the purchase of prefabricated buildings has been significantly reduced.</P>

	<P>All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologists or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS. Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists <Col N="979"/>approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s Website.</P>
    <P>NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for Reasonable Accommodation in Certificate Examinations and responds to queries in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the NEPS in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 122 at present. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers. The Public Appointments Service has concluded a new recruitment competition for the appointment of Educational Psychologists to NEPS. Regional panels have been established to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need. My Department is currently in the process of recruiting a further 9 psychologists.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at both primary and post-primary level in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
    <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only <Col N="980"/>one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
    <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools in Kildare has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools in Kildare. 170 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared to 105 in 2004/05.</P>
    <P>At second level too major progress has been made. The pupil:teacher ratio at second level has been reduced from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.4:1 in the 2004/05 school year. This reduction has been achieved through the creation of almost 1,800 posts and the retention of over 2,000 posts that would otherwise have been lost due to falling enrolments.</P>
    <P>This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 295 together.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware of the enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with Special Educational Needs. At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
    <P>At second level approximately 1,654 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers.</P>
    <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Enormous progress has also been made in relation to increasing the number of Special Needs Assistants who specifically cater for the care needs of children with special educational needs. There are over 7,300 whole time equivalent SNAs in primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides funding for the purchase of assistive technology and/or specialised equipment where appropriate.</P>
    <P>All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologists or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS. Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s Website.</P><Col N="983"/>
    <P>I can confirm that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special educational needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that responsibility for the provision of therapy services rests with the Health Service Executive.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
    <P Just="Left">To discharge its responsibilities, the Board is developing, on a continuing basis, a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents/ guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
    <P>The total authorised staffing complement of the Board is 94 comprising 16 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 12 Senior EWOs and 61 EWOs. Five regional teams are in place with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. In deploying its service staff, the NEWB has prioritised the provision of services to the most disadvantaged areas and the most at-risk groups. This deployment includes areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme where an intensive full level of service is provided. For all remaining areas the NEWB deploy their staff on a regional basis providing various levels of service. Since September 2005 every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service.</P>
    <P>The Board is continuously reviewing its procedures for prioritising children and families who require intervention, in order to ensure that children with the greatest level of need gain maximum benefit from available resources, and <Col N="984"/>to work with local agencies in prioritising children&rsquo;s and family needs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the NEWB personnel there are some 490 staff, within the education sector, deployed in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves an element of school attendance. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping the issue of the NEWBs staffing under review in light of the roll-out of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs and in the context of Government policy on public service numbers.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In 1998 my Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to conduct a survey of radon levels in all primary and post-primary schools. In addition, in June 2001 circular letter M46/01 issued to all Boards of Management informing them of the Department&rsquo;s initiative and advising schools on the course of action necessary for radon mitigation.</P>
    <P>During the course of the survey, 4,072 schools were invited to participate. A report published by the RPII in May 2004 showed that approximately 7% of schools tested in County Kildare had radon levels in excess of 400 Bq/m<?oasys _cf7- ?>3<?oasys _cf1- ?>. The RPII wrote to each of these schools, enclosing a copy of the test results, and advising that the results of the survey be made available to all staff and parents.

    <P>The radon reference set for the workplace under the &ldquo;Radiological Protection Act, 1991 ((Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000&rdquo; (Statutory Instrument 125 of 2000)) is 400 Bq/m<?oasys _cf7- ?>3<?oasys _cf1- ?>. Notwithstanding the fact that the radon reference for workplaces is 400 Bq/m<?oasys _cf7- ?>3<?oasys _cf1- ?>, the Department issues grants to schools for the installation of suitable vents in classrooms where radon levels are between 200 Bq/m<?oasys _cf7- ?>3<?oasys _cf1- ?> and 400 Bq/m<?oasys _cf7- ?>3<?oasys _cf1- ?>.</P>
    <P>Schools with levels above 400 Bq/m<?oasys _cf7- ?>3<?oasys _cf1- ?> are advised to secure the services of a suitably quali<Col N="985"/>fied consultant architect/engineer to carry out all necessary remedial works and these works are fully funded by the Department.</P>
    <P>Following completion of remediation works, post remediation measurements are carried out by the RPII to determine if the remediation has been effective. This process is ongoing and the RPII continue to carry out post remediation testing in schools. Radon barriers are included in the design of all new school building projects.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year. According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 187 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which has issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year will be a Principal and 7 mainstream class teachers.</P>
    <P>Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
    <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2006 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>The first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held on the 25 May, 2006. Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2006. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 12 May, 24 June and 18 October respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.</P>

	<P>The information is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy. I want to assure the Deputy, however, that my Department fully recognises the crucial role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve sporting facilities and in particular, indoor facilities. As a consequence of increased levels of funding for school accommodation, which this Government has provided since taking up office, major capital projects at both primary and second level schools require the provision of adequate sporting facilities, providing that the site is of sufficient size &mdash; or where a new school on a greenfield site is being built. This extends to the provision of both PE halls/GP areas and the provision of hard play areas and where site conditions allow playing pitches. A comprehensive equipment schedule is included in the funding package for such facilities, ranging from table-tennis sets to netball and indoor soccer equipment.</P>
    <P>Regarding specific sports equipment grants, my Department has provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools specifically for this purpose to enable them to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.</P>
    <P>In addition, all primary schools receive an annual Minor Works Grant from my Department and it is open to these school management authorities to use this devolved grant for the purchase of physical education equipment provided it is not required for more urgent works. My Department also considers applications for additional grant aid for such equipment where schools can demonstrate that the minor works grant funding is insufficient for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to PE facilities in primary schools generally is that the PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</P>
    <P>Applications for the provision of PE or sports facilities in existing schools are considered in the context of all other applications on hand for capital investment e.g. applications for new schools; <Col N="991"/>refurbishment projects; extensions; new sites; remediation programmes and so on. This will be done in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The individual concerned was retired, by the President, on the advice of the Government with effect from a date in June, 1969. The retirement was effected pursuant to Section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954 and Paragraph 18(1)(f) of Defence Force <Col N="992"/>Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo;. The Deputy will appreciate that a decision to retire an officer &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo; is only taken for the most compelling reasons. The Government advice to the President was on grounds of security. I am satisfied that the matter was handled in an entirely appropriate and proper manner in 1969 and that the decision taken then was taken only after very detailed and due consideration.</P>
    <P>The individual initiated proceedings in the High Court in November 1998 in relation to the circumstances of his retirement some 29 years earlier. The High Court found in favour of the State in June 1999 on grounds of inordinate delay in the bringing of the proceedings. The individual appealed to the Supreme Court in September 1999. The Supreme Court refused the appeal in January 2001.</P>
    <P>In early July 2002, arising from a newspaper feature article on the case, published on 29th June 2002, the then Minister requested the Judge Advocate General to examine and to review the case with regard to the following terms of reference:- &ldquo;To enquire into the circumstances surrounding the retirement of (the individual referred to) by means of a complete review of all relevant documentation held by the Department of Defence and by the Defence Forces, and to have full access to any civil or military personnel for the purposes of their providing explanation in relation to any apparent gaps or ambiguities in the documentation and to report to the Minister with her conclusions and recommendations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These terms of reference were subsequently enlarged by the then Minister at the request of the Judge Advocate General to provide that the Judge Advocate General was &ldquo;...to be entitled, within the Terms of Reference, and the manner of the Inquiry contemplated, to take such representation in writing from any party whom she considers to be appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Judge Advocate General, a civilian barrister, carried out a detailed examination and review of all the historical documentation relating to the decision to retire the individual concerned, by reference to the entirety of both the civil and military files in the matter. Her report was submitted to the then Minister in mid September, 2002 and was published in October, 2002.</P>
    <P>In December 2002 the individual applied to the High Court for an order quashing this report by the Judge Advocate General. The High Court found in favour of the applicant for reasons enumerated in the text of the High Court judgement. It should be emphasised, however, that the High Court judgement in the matter of the report of the Judge Advocate General specifically related to the actual procedures utilized by the Judge Advocate General in the course of her review and examination of this matter in 2002 and to the release by the Department of Defence of certain documents to the individual only after com<Col N="993"/>pletion of the report. The substantive issue, namely the Government decision in 1969 to recommend the retirement of this individual from the Defence Forces by the President, remains entirely unaffected by the judgement of the High Court, a point specifically emphasised within the text of the judgement itself.</P>
    <P>The position now is that the individual in question has had access to these documents relating to his retirement since 14 November, 2002 when his legal representatives attended the Department and were given copies of all the relevant records held in my Department. In the circumstances, particularly the considerable passage of time, I do not propose to take any further action in relation to this matter.</P>

As there are more volunteers among serving civil servants at all grade levels to transfer to my Department it is not envisaged that there will be any recruitment or transfers on promotion. An additional thirteen staff from outside my Department have been assigned to this Department for the purpose of relocating to Newbridge. Twenty-<Col N="994"/>four members of staff who opted not to move to Newbridge have volunteered to transfer to other Government Departments that have units that are proposed for decentralisation, and some have already moved to their new Departments. One hundred and fifty personnel have opted to remain in Dublin, and to date, eight of these have been reassigned, with a further number to be assigned over the coming months. There are two non-general service posts in my Department and one of the officers concerned has opted to transfer to Newbridge. The Office of Public Works is in the process of acquiring a site for the new Departmental Headquarters in Newbridge.</P>

	<P>Following extensive public consultation on draft guidelines, I intend shortly to publish revised Planning Guidelines for Wind Energy Development, which will assist planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in determining the siting of future wind farm developments. The Guidelines will assist planning authorities to identify areas where there is significant wind energy potential and to map these in the development plan so as to provide clarity for the public, developers and the planning authority. The Guidelines will encourage planning authorities to favour the grant of planning permission in those areas, subject to compliance with siting and design criteria.</P>
    <P>The Guidelines also provide advice on issues to consider during the planning application process and cover other environmental aspects, such as impacts on the built and natural heritage.</P>
    <P>The new Guidelines will substantially improve on the existing ones issued in 1996. I expect them to play a major role in fulfilling the potential of wind power, and consequently to make a significant contribution to the achievement of our Kyoto targets.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland <Col N="997"/>(RPII) Co. Kildare is not considered to be a high radon area HRA, with the exception of very small area in the south of the county. In this regard it is a matter for the public authorities concerned to consider whether testing for radon is required in their buildings.</P>
    <P>To date the RPII has carried out radon measurements in 20 workplaces in Co. Kildare at the voluntary initiative of the employers concerned. None of the workplaces measured had radon concentration levels above 400 Bq/m<?oasys _cf7- ?>3<?oasys _cf1- ?> which is the National Reference level for workplaces, above which radon remediation works should be considered. Further radon measurements in workplaces in County Kildare will have been carried out by qualified operators other than RPII.</P>
    <P>Schools in Kildare were measured as part of a nationwide survey undertaken in the period 1998 to 2001 by the RPII at the request of the Department of Education and Science. Of the 126 schools measured, 24 had radon levels above the National Reference level of 200 Becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m<?oasys _cf7- ?>3<?oasys _cf1- ?>) in at least one room. The Department of Education and Science has, I understand, already provided funding for remedial measures in all schools affected.</P>
    <P>The Government has, over the years, largely through the RPII, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of radon. The RPII has been encouraging householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary.</P>
    <P>In June 1997, my Department introduced upgraded building regulations which required all new buildings, including new houses, which commenced construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction. In October 2004, my Department published an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that the 1997 radon protection measures are carried out more effectively.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department and the RPII have produced brochures and a booklet on radon which provide information on the risks associated with radon and on remediation solutions available.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the above, considerable resources are being expended by Government on promoting public awareness of radon. Government efforts and resources, together with the RPII, will continue to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders and employers so as to enable and encourage them to address monitor<Col N="998"/>ing or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Houses sold under the various affordable housing schemes at a discount from market value contain a clawback provision, in order to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes. In the case of affordable dwellings provided under shared ownership arrangements and at a discount from market value, a person wishing to buy out the local authority&rsquo;s share must in accordance with section 10(3)(a)(i) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, refund an amount equal to the original discount received.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of the various affordable housing schemes are kept under review in my Department to ensure that they are operating efficiently and effectively and in an equitable manner. There are a number of relevant examinations under way at present in this area during which all elements of the schemes, including the application of the clawback to shared ownership housing, will be addressed.</P>
