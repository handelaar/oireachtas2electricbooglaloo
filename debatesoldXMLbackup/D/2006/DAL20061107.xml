      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My Department has one item of legislation on the A list, the statute law revision Bill, which will be published this session.  The Bill will continue the process of modernising the Statute Book by repealing over 3,000 ancient statutes dating from between 1200 and 6 December 1922 that are now redundant or obsolete.  The Bill will also positively retain in the region of 1,350 statutes from the same period, as they are not proposed for repeal at present.  Ultimately, it is the intention that all legislation predating the foundation of the State should be repealed.  Where we need to keep the provisions of any pre-1922 legislation, it is intended that they will be re-enacted in a more modern form.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1702"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we likely to see any legislation to prepare for a referendum between now and the general election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two issues, one of which concerns Northern Ireland.  As I stated last week on the Order of Business, that appears more likely to go to an election than a referendum.  It is still in abeyance and will be until the legislation is finalised in two weeks&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>On the second issue, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will be involved in discussions with the parties regarding the rights of children under the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  He assured us on a number of occasions that there would not be a referendum.  What brought about the change of heart?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When asked questions of this nature, I always state that nothing is ever agreed until the Cabinet is prepared to make a decision.  It will not have the status of agreement until then.</P>
        <P>On the question of children, in the summer, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, informed the UN that we were examining the possibility of legislative change.  That was on the cards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Taoiseach envisage that legislation will be required, on foot of the St. Andrews Agreement or, in the worst case scenario, as a result of a need to move to the so-called plan B, in the context of the two Governments&rsquo; role in bringing forward greater all-Ireland integration?  If such legislation falls under the remit of other Departments, will the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department have a co-ordinating role in respect of it?</P>
        <P>Will the further statute law revision Bill being worked on in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, which is a follow up to the 2005 Act, complete the process or will further legislation be required in respect of other obsolete Acts that may not be included in the tranche currently under consideration?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As previously stated in respect of the St. Andrews Agreement, the Attorney General wishes to wait to examine the legislation, when it emerges in its final form, before declaring his position on constitutional and other issues.  The deadline is set for two weeks from Friday next, so there should be something shortly thereafter.  Legislative issues could well arise but they will probably not be dealt with by my Department.  However, I will have a co-ordinating role in respect of them.  We will wait and see what emerges.</P>
        <P>On the statute law revision Bill, there have already been four restatements of legislation in <Col N="1703"/>the areas of consumer law, defence, tourist traffic and succession.  Earlier in the year, the Government gave approval for the Law Reform Commission to commence a programme of restatement and established the restatement steering group, which is made up of representatives of the commission and the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Council and which is chaired by my Department.  In May, we announced a public consultation process to obtain the views of members of the public on areas in which the law should be restated, as a priority.  There will, therefore, be restatement in other areas.  The consultation process to which I refer has concluded and the restatement steering group will consider the submissions it has received and will soon agree rolling out a programme of further restatements.</P>
        <P>While the group will have amended various statutes, deleted those from pre-1922 that are redundant or listed in a positive fashion the 1,350 to which I referred earlier, it believes that the latter should be transformed, on a restatement basis, into more modern legislation.  It is not that these Acts are redundant &mdash; they are not &mdash; but many of them are written in old language and are not easily available.  Many of them are only available in bound volumes.</P>
        <P>It makes much more sense that over a period of time &mdash; the changes cannot be made simultaneously &mdash; they would be updated, on a restatement basis, in more modern legislation.  That process has already started.  I do not know how many years it would take but, obviously, whenever a particular aspect of the law is touched on, any of these old Acts should be restated in modern legislation.  That is the way they hope to update it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to ask the Taoiseach a question on his commitment, or promise, to bring forward legislation on the Kenny report.  I am not sure which Department he envisages that relates to but, as he made the promise, I will ask him to adjudicate on that aspect and perhaps give us more information on when it might become a reality.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the level of latitude the Ceann Comhairle has afforded on this question because we are dealing procedurally with legislation which predates the Act of Union, technically going back to the days of flogging and slavery, and of hanging, drawing and quartering people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The report came after the Act of Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We are going right back to the Dark Ages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Some want to go back again.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1704"/>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That did not give any protection anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>In Iraq, it might be right up to date.  I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s latitude.  It indicates a reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Ask a simple question and allow the Taoiseach to answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach expect any recommendations on the legislation, which we are dealing with in order, that he will find relevant to modern legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy referring to the 1,350 Acts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does he expect to learn anything from them or is he just abolishing them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The rest are abolished, except for the 1,350 Acts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Brehon laws could be in force.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Parts of them could still be in there.  Some of the Acts date back to 1200.</P>
        <P>The other matter, not the full process of the Kenny report but the land zoning issue, is being looked at in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It needs more than being looked at.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is being drafted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I was interested in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment on the referendum that he proposed at the weekend, where some of his Ministers obviously got a little carried away, including my good friend, the Minister, Deputy Roche, who is beside him and who went into orbit like a cloud of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach stated that the comment he made about a proposed referendum on children has no status other than comment until the Cabinet agrees it.  There are not many members of the Cabinet who will disagree with the Taoiseach and the vast majority of political representatives accept the principle of what is involved.  However, he has pre-empted the committee, which has not yet reported on this, although it produced a 90-page report today.  Is it his judgment that the possibility of a referendum on the Northern Ireland question is receding because Dr. Paisley may want an election immediately after the St. Andrew&rsquo;s business is concluded successfully?</P>
        <P>Does he believe that such a referendum might not take place and that there would be a referendum on an agreed wording in respect of the <Col N="1705"/>protection of children&rsquo;s rights, on which at least there would be significant support, some time before a general election &mdash; which would be followed by a divisive campaign on how the country should be run?  Perhaps that is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s assertion of good politics.  Why did he choose to announce that a referendum would be likely to take place, given that the committee has not even reported on the matter and the Minister appointed has not yet consulted with any Opposition personnel on whatever proposed wording might exist?  Second, in the event of referenda taking place, we have raised on a number of occasions the issue of consideration being given to recognition in the Constitution of the official Irish sign language, which is different from sign language in England.  A small but significant number of people use it and it is important to them that it should be considered as well.</P>
        <P>Third &mdash; I doubt the Taoiseach will pre-empt the report in this case &mdash; the Cabinet has received back from committee the report dealing with assisted human reproduction.  Is he likely to make a statement on having an adjudication on that?  When will the Cabinet consider that report, which was referred back to it by the committee some time ago?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify two issues.  Deputy Rabbitte asked why I did not say on previous occasions that that issue was pending and I replied that the Cabinet had not cleared it.  However, the Cabinet has done so now.  Second, it is not pre-empting the committee, which is examining the criminal law aspects.  The suggestion, which is not just mine as it has been uttered on other occasions over the past 14 years, is this is a far broader issue, which should examine maltreatment, the care of children, the treatment of children within the homes and a range of other issues.  I said I would say nothing on the committee until it had reported.</P>
        <P>On the substantive issue, to the best of my knowledge, the first time this came up was when Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness raised it in the Kilkenny case.  Subsequently, the Constitution review group, which reported in 1996, gave us guidelines on what we should do.  The issue then came up in the two reports in Europe and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has raised it a number of times over the past two or three years, including this year, when he said we would deal with that aspect.</P>
        <P>I was careful the other day not to pre-empt the House or other interested parties because we must come to an agreed wording, which is not simple.  I launched the report of the group that examined this on behalf of the Oireachtas last January.  I stayed there some hours that night, as perhaps did the Deputy, because all the interested groups were present.  There are plenty of different, diverging views on this issue and, <Col N="1706"/>therefore, it will not automatically be easy to agree the wording.  However, I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to work on consultation about the wording immediately.  I do not want to comment on a date because we must get the agreed wording first.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet committee on social inclusion and children last met on 11 October 2006.  The Cabinet committee will have its next meeting on 15 November 2006, with a further meeting scheduled in December.  As I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions, Cabinet committees are an integral part of the Cabinet process.  Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet or Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government.  The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Previously, the Chair suggested that these questions should be submitted for written answer.  The Chair is in a difficult position because, while the Deputy might like more meetings, no supplementary questions arise.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy knows, these committees are clearly an integral part of the Cabinet process.  They are confidential and what is discussed therein is not appropriate to these questions, which are in accordance with Standing Orders.

	<P>The Ceann Comhairle seems to be ruling that the answer to the question is that the Cabinet sub-committee met on 11 October and will next meet on 15 November and no more.  We can all go home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That was the question asked by the Deputy and that is the reason I suggest a written question be tabled.  I do not see the sense in having the Chair intervene in oral questions so often every day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle must accept that he must leave the Opposition with some little prerogative to table whatever question we believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair cannot circumvent precedent.  It is a requirement of the <Col N="1709"/>Chair to ensure that we do not breach Cabinet confidentiality in answering these questions.  There are other ways for the Deputy to raise these questions with the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That we cannot raise a generic question and hang it on the peg of the question as phrased is absurd and overly restrictive, and makes a nonsense of Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is one point of view.  If the Deputy wishes to introduce a Standing Order to change the position, the Chair will be delighted to implement it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We face the obstacle course again.  Is the Taoiseach in a position, under these rules, to remind us of the membership of the Cabinet sub-committee on drugs and social inclusion?  Given the Chair&rsquo;s ruling on this matter and focusing on the social inclusion aspect of the sub-committee&rsquo;s remit, has the need to integrate the new communities in Ireland, which make a valuable contribution on a raft of levels, been a focus of previous meetings or will it be so in the schedule of meetings of the sub-committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The sub-committee is made up of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  The meetings are also attended by the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, the Minister of State with special responsibility for housing and urban renewal and for drugs strategy and community affairs, the Minister of State with special responsibility for equality, including disability issues, and the Minister of State with special responsibility for labour affairs, including training.</P>
        <P>Under the rulings, any of these questions may be asked but they must be put to the line Minister involved.  That is not my ruling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the questions request dates, will the Taoiseach say whether it is or has been considered necessary to convene the Cabinet sub-committee on drugs and social inclusion on an emergency basis?  I will make a point in the context of my request for a date.  Last night there was an apparent bomb explosion outside a house in Finglas and a pipe bomb attack in Ridgewood in Swords in my constituency.  If, as is the suspicion, drugs were involved, should the door not be left open for the sub-committee to meet as the need arises to re-evaluate its response or the Garda response?  Can social inclusion, in <Col N="1710"/>this case, mean the fear of children being included in such atrocities, which are very often drug-related?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Day-to-day operational issues relating to drugs are dealt with by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Ministers and the sub-committee are involved in co-ordinating various policy issues.  The Deputy referred to day-to-day issues, which are dealt with by the Garda Commissioner or the members of the dedicated drugs task force, working with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  They are dealt with on a routine basis, seven days a week every week.  Policy issues are discussed in detail by the sub-committee, which meets normally on a monthly basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This is hardly normal activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the regional drug groups received &euro;500,000 each for their work.  When the sub-committee next meets, on the date announced by the Taoiseach, will it discuss reports from the different regional groups as to their capacity to deal with tip-offs?  I understand a major supply of ecstasy tablets&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is outside the terms of the questions.  I ruled Deputy Rabbitte out of order and, in fairness, we must be consistent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Everything is out of order today.  I have tabled a number of questions to the relevant line Ministers on the matters in question and have received answers.  Does the serious growth in the illegal drug trade throughout the country now warrant the sub-committee meeting on a more regular basis?  Can a report be made available to the sub-committee indicating the seriousness of the situation and making recommendations to line Ministers as to what should be done to combat a situation that is getting out of control?</P>

	<P>The drugs issue is not a monthly but a daily issue and meetings are always going on with the regional groups outside of the committee structures.

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As Deputies know, I answered extensive questions in the House the week before last on the Commission of Investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings which is chaired by Mr. Paddy MacEntee SC.  As I indicated then, I have now granted a further extension to Mr. MacEntee until 11 December.  I published his latest interim report last week.  While Mr. MacEntee&rsquo;s work is separate and independent, it stems from the first report of Mr. Justice Barron and it is therefore appropriate that I mention these exchanges in the context of today&rsquo;s questions.</P>
        <P>I referred Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s final report on the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk in 1976, and other loyalist paramilitary attacks from that period, to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights prior to the end of the last D&aacute;il session.  The committee published the report upon receipt.  The main focus of the report is the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk in 1976.  Mr. Hugh Watters, aged 60, and Mr. Jack Rooney, aged 62, were both killed in the attack.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report also makes reference to other attacks by loyalist paramilitaries around that time which the judge deems relevant in order to provide a broader context for his findings.  These include the Castleblayney bombs, the Dublin Airport bomb and other bombings in the State.  It also includes a number of attacks in Northern Ireland, including the attack on the Miami Showband, the attack on the Rock Bar, Keady, the attack on Donnelly&rsquo;s Bar, Silverbridge, attacks on the Reavey and O&rsquo;Dowd families in south Armagh and the murders of Sean Farmer and Colm <Col N="1712"/>McCartney.  It also refers to an explosion and murder at Barronrath Bridge, County Kildare.</P>
        <P>I understand the committee held three days of public hearings, ending on 4 October, with interested persons, and is due to send its final report to both Houses by the deadline of 17 November.  This final report completes the work of the Independent Commission of Inquiry which was first led by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton and subsequently by Mr. Justice Barron.  I am very grateful for their work in trying to help bring justice to the victims of several horrific atrocities.</P>
        <P>All of Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s reports have now been referred to the joint committee, which has in turn done a commendable job in hearing the evidence, not least of the bereaved, and in reporting promptly and with clear recommendations.</P>
        <P>We have acted on the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee to date.  On matters that are entirely within the remit of the Government or public bodies within the State, we established the commission of investigation into the 1974 bombings under Mr Paddy MacEntee SC.  When that work is complete, we will address the recommendations from the second and third reports, which relate to the 1972 and 1973 bombings and the Ludlow murder.  We will consider the recommendations of the report on the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern when the committee has made its final report.</P>
        <P>Where appropriate, action has already been taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda to recognise and address shortcomings that were identified in the reports to date.</P>
        <P>With regard to some very important issues, the co-operation of the British authorities is essential and the Oireachtas committee has recognised this.  The Government has been using all appropriate means in its efforts to ensure that co-operation.  I have raised the matter with Prime Minister Blair on a number of occasions and contacts with the British Government are ongoing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay tribute to the quality of the work of Mr. Justice Barron.  He deserves enormous credit for the detailed report he has published on this occasion.  It is in keeping with the painstaking manner in which he has discharged his obligations in terms of the prior reports referred to by the Taoiseach.  We ought to consider some way we could appropriately mark his contribution.  It has attracted surprisingly little scrutiny outside of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Taoiseach agrees Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s findings are very grave, namely, that a loyalist group based somewhere in mid-Ulster was most likely responsible for this particular outrage, that there is strong circumstantial evidence of collusion with the security forces, that the Garda investigation was inadequate in many <Col N="1713"/>respects and that little consideration has ever been shown for the families directly involved.  The Taoiseach made a passing reference to the lack of co-operation from the British authorities.  Now that we have this report and since its receipt in July has he raised the matter with the British Prime Minister?  Does the Taoiseach consider that raising the matter with the British Prime Minister is a waste of time?</P>
<P>Nobody has ever been held responsible for atrocities that were carried out in this jurisdiction, it is suspected, by loyalist paramilitaries.  A historic inquiries team has been established in Northern Ireland to open these murder cases where nobody was ever charged.  Perhaps the time has come in this jurisdiction for the Government to consider the establishment of a similar team that would reopen old cases which involve loyalist and republican paramilitaries where nobody was charged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy has raised a number of points.  I agree with him that the reports are excellent.  We have had four comprehensive reports ranging from the early work of the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton to the work in recent years which has been painstakingly carried out, and has involved huge detail, by Mr. Justice Barron.  Mr. Justice Barron who has worked within offices of my Department for many years worked diligently and put in a huge effort on this work.  He has co-ordinated his work in so far as it has been possible for us to open up various contacts with the British, to Downing Street, the Secretary of State and the NIO, and to others in the security force to receive assistance.  If Mr. Justice Barron was here he would say that at best that has been patchy.</P>
        <P>For that reason we have continued on his work and recommendations on a number of fronts.  We established the Commission of Investigation into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings in 1974 under Mr. Patrick MacEntee.  Following much effort and work, we have opened up new information for him with the security forces, which he has diligently followed during the past 18 months or so.  As I mentioned previously, there are legal aspects about what he can and cannot do, but that matter is under discussion.  He has now completed his investigative and preparatory work and will report on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some issues in the second and third reports are being examined.  The Oireachtas joint committee recommends that the Government consider extending the terms of reference of the order establishing the commission of investigation to include some of these issues.  On completion of Mr. MacEntee&rsquo;s final report we intend to return to those issues.  As I said previously, Mr. MacEntee has made it clear he does not want to engage in that exercise.  If we follow that through for the 1972 and 1973 bombings, we will have to <Col N="1714"/>get another person to work on it.    In regard to the recommendations made in the report on the murder of Seamus Ludlow, some of these are similar to recommendations in a previous report.  We would be in a better position to review and address all these recommendations when the current commission of investigation has completed its work.  Specific recommendations from the Ludlow report have already been acted on and, with regard to the point made by Deputy Rabbitte on following up cases, the Garda has established a unit to work on some of the historical cases.  It has used all the mechanisms available to it to liaise with the PSNI in respect of the investigation into the murder of Seamus Ludlow.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has appointed a dedicated team of garda&iacute; to re-examine the case in a proactive manner and to determine whether there is any possibility of bringing any or all of the four suspects to justice.  In that particular case, it is clear that Mr. Justice Barron has pinpointed who he believes were responsible for the murder.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that, as recommended by the Oireachtas joint committee, the reinvestigation of the murder of Seamus Ludlow is at an advanced stage and is under the direction of a Garda superintendent.  Liaison will be established and maintained with the historical inquiries team in Northern Ireland and the family has been kept fully informed of the investigations.  Officials of my Department have also been following up cases and met representatives of the Miami Showband families and Justice for the Forgotten.  I have also met a number of these groups.</P>
        <P>These reports should be debated in the House.  The appropriate time to do that, subject to the Oireachtas committee&rsquo;s opinion, is probably when it completes its work on the fourth report.  I understand it will then put together its conclusions in respect of the four reports.  That would be an appropriate time, although we could debate it at an earlier stage if that is considered necessary.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Barron has highlighted and brought to a detailed position what went on during those times in respect of all the cases he investigated.  He has brought to light as much evidence as he was able to collect from all the records available in official and Garda files, as well as from other files he acquired both inside and outside the State.  While it perhaps does not solve everything, we are in a much better position now than we were when we set about this task several years ago.</P>
        <P>A number of other cases were also examined but it would take me a long time to mention them all.  In approximately 20 cases, we now have significant details regarding evidence which we previously did not have.  It is just a historical question at this stage because of the circumstances of the time and the nature of the Garda investigations <Col N="1715"/>of these cases.  I have discussed this at length with the families and, while they always ask me to explain it, there is not much point trying to explain more than 30 years later.</P>
        <P>The reality, which some of the families can never understand, is that three months after the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, which represented the biggest single atrocity of the Troubles until the Omagh atrocity in 1998, the official files closed.  There is no point making criticisms or going on about it because that is what happened and I have faithfully, in countless meetings with the relatives, explained the position.  They were different times, with different circumstances and difficulties.  The families do not understand that and believe it was because of collusion and a cover-up.  I think it was just the way it was in those days.  Although 30 people were killed and more than 100 were injured, the entire investigation ceased after three months.  However, that is what happened.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I have spent long hours trying to explain this to the families.  They interpret the matter differently.  I do not think there was any malice on our part; it just reflected the circumstances of the time.  All we can do now is investigate the cases as completely as possible.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The trend in the headline crime statistics for the three quarters to date in 2006 has been positive.  The provisional headline crime statistics for the third quarter &mdash; the most recent &mdash; show a decrease of 1.6% for the quarter compared with the same quarter in 2005.  These statistics are the first crime statistics to be published independently by the Central Statistics Office following my decision that new arrangements should be put in place for their publication.</P><Col N="1716"/>
        <P>With regard to longer-term crime trends, the level of headline crime in 2005 was lower than that in 2002 by 4.4%.  Furthermore, in 1995, when we had a population of 3.6 million, there were 29 serious crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of more than 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population &mdash; 15% fewer crimes per 1,000 of the population.  By way of comparison, during 1995 and 1996 there were 29 and 28 crimes per 1,000 population in each of those years.</P>
        <P>I am determined that any trends which emerge are addressed as they are identified and that as a result we continue to enjoy crime rates which are low by European standards.  To this end I am active on two fronts, by providing the personnel and resources to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which it requires and by updating the criminal law where that is necessary.</P>
        <P>In October 2004, I announced that I was proceeding with the Government&rsquo;s proposal to recruit 2,000 additional garda&iacute; over the life of the Government and an implementation plan to achieve that expansion was drawn up in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  The plan, published in November 2004, envisaged a recruiting strategy that would see the combined strength of the force reaching 14,044 garda&iacute;, including trainees, by the end of 2006.  The overall strength of the force, including recruits in training is now 14,137.  We have delivered on our target well ahead of schedule because instead of recruiting 1,050 in each year, we increased the number to 1,100.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>The expansion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fully on target.  Since the first quarter of 2005, approximately 275 recruits have been inducted to the Garda Training College each quarter.  This has resulted in the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increasing to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702, all ranks, as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060, 19%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.  The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137.</P>
        <P>Excellent progress has been made on the establishment of the Garda Reserve.  More than 7,000 have applied to join the reserve.  Reserve members will provide valuable support for their full-time colleagues and will enhance the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to emerging policing challenges and allow for more garda&iacute; to be visibly deployed on the street.  The first group of trainees are due to graduate in December.</P><Col N="1717"/>
        <P>The Garda budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, which represents a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.  In addition to expenditure on operations, these resources are also being used to provide required facilities.  Most recently, significant property has been purchased in Tipperary to provide a major tactical and practical training centre for the force.  This will enable a broad range of training facilities to be developed.</P>
        <P>High on the Government&rsquo;s list of policing priorities for 2006, which have been incorporated into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing plan for the year, is the continued targeting of organised crime, in particular drug trafficking, and the gun culture associated with it, through the use of specialist units and targeted, intelligence-led operations.  To achieve this, Operation Anvil commenced in the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Region in May 2005, and it was extended nationwide in 2006 at my request.  It is an intelligence-led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting this criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain-clothes patrols.  The operation remains in place and is ongoing.  Additional resources have been made available this year for the operation of &euro;11 million, with an additional &euro;10 million made available for further operations to tackle gang related crime.  Operation Anvil will continue to be funded to the extent and as long as the Commissioner considers it is necessary to do so and it is fulfilling its objectives.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in recorded crime in the target crime areas under the operation.</P>
        <P>With regard to legislative measures, the Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences.  In addition, the Act contains an essential updating of our criminal law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society.</P>
        <P>It updates and strengthens the law on firearms.  With effect from 1 November, mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, came into effect for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, <Col N="1718"/>possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.  There are also new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as &ldquo;sawing-off&rdquo; a shotgun.</P>
        <P>The Act also contains provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour.  It empowers a senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner.  Separate provision is being made for young people.  The Act introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There will be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda juvenile diversion programme.  Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the courts.</P>
        <P>Work is under way in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make the necessary internal arrangements to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.  As soon as these arrangements are in place, and following consultations between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the relevant provisions of the Act will be commenced.</P>
        <P>Work is also under way on putting the necessary arrangements in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to introduce the provisions in the Act whereby a fixed charge notice can be issued for the public order offences of disorderly conduct in a public place and intoxication in a public place.</P>
        <P>A criminal justice miscellaneous provisions Bill is being drafted.  The Bill will introduce a number of changes and improvements in the operation of the criminal justice system, give legislative effect to a number of international instruments relating to criminal law and facilitate the operation in Ireland of the Schengen Information System.  Work is also proceeding on a Bill to provide for the establishment on a statutory basis of a DNA database.</P>

	<P>The people will not be reassured by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response.  He seems to be in denial that we have a huge problem with crime.  Does he not accept that headline crime, serious crime generally, recognising the Garda statistics has increased my more than 40% since 2000?  Does the T&aacute;naiste not recognise that even the recent CSO statistics clearly show that by comparison with his first full year in office, 2003, violent crime in the past 12 months has seriously escalated and is now virtually out of control?  Does he not accept that over the period to which I refer, murders have increased by 25%, rapes have increased by 33% and firearms offences <Col N="1719"/>have increased by 43%?  Does he not agree that these figures are of concern and that unless they are accepted as being such there is no hope of confronting them?  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s main problem is that he is in denial of the extent of the problem.</P>
        <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste know about a study recently carried out in Dublin, as reported in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, which indicates that three quarters of the people in Dublin live in fear of being assaulted?  The study found that 88% of females are scared to walk in their own areas at night for fear of being attacked.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has trotted out his figures for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Would he not accept that pompously parading like a peacock in Templemore, pretending that newly recruited student garda&iacute; are out on the beat is not the answer to this problem?  Would he not accept that four and a half years ago he stated in his party&rsquo;s manifesto &mdash; I presume it was drafted by him at the time &mdash; that his party would increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by 2,000 members?  In the same election campaign, the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto stated that the planned strength for 2002 of 12,000 would be reached and if elected to serve in Government, Fianna F&aacute;il would expand the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by a further 2,000.  That was four and a half years ago and we have still not reached 13,000.  We do not have even half the promised increase.  The T&aacute;naiste talking about what he said in 2004 is not the issue.</P>
        <P>Does he not recognise that the people are paying the price for the absolute neglect of the Government?  I do not blame the Minister alone.  He told me in 2004 that he could not get the money to put the extra recruitment in place at the time.  The then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, was holding on to the purse strings.  All the members of Government are in the one boat; they are all responsible.  This was a Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats commitment and it has not been delivered.  Does the Minister accept that, in the meantime, the people have been paying the price?  Nowhere is safe now.  People walk the streets in fear.  They do not feel safe in their own homes.  A five-year-old child standing outside his grandmother&rsquo;s house is not safe from the depths of depravity to which the criminals in this country have sunk and which they are being let get away with by the Government.</P>

Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe sought in the meantime to renege on what was agreed in the House and to suggest that the firearms amnesty was a failure because it did not have the numbers that would follow from a completely anonymous amnesty.

        <QRef>[36429/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s recent publication for the first time of the provisional headline crime statistics for the third quarter of 2006 is welcome in providing further expertise and independence in the compilation of such statistics and in acting as an important aid in informing policy formulation.</P>
        <P>While being mindful of the need for caution in the interpretation of such statistics, especially when attempting to extrapolate any trends over short periods, the CSO report provides us with important data on drug offences statistics and trends.  I stress to Deputy Howlin that unlike other serious crimes such as murder, armed robbery and rape, the drug figures in Garda records and in the CSO statistics reflect successful Garda activity in combating the drugs menace.  If a murder takes place, that is a question of fact.  If an armed robbery in a bank takes place, it is a question of fact, but if drugs offences are taking place in the community, the only real way they will end up in Garda figures is if there is a detection and an arrest or a seizure.</P>
        <P>The garda&iacute; do not record what is obviously unrecordable.  There is no doubt that important <Col N="1722"/>arrests have been made and serious inroads made into the activities of drug gangs.  Any estimate of the overall proportion of such drugs coming into the country, about which Deputy Howlin asks, would be highly speculative.  I agree with the Deputy, however, that what the garda&iacute; recover must be a minority of the drugs brought into the country, but it is impossible to say how much of a minority they represent.  If the garda&iacute; knew exactly how much was coming into the country or could estimate it, they would be in a position to intervene and seize the drugs in question.</P>
        <P>Some of the key information which the report provides shows that there is a 8.6% increase in the total number of drugs offences recorded for the first three quarters of 2006 compared to 2005.  There is a 23.8% increase in the total number of drugs offences recorded for the third quarter of 2006 in comparison with the equivalent third quarter for 2005.  That shows increased Garda activity and increased successes.  There was a sizeable increase of 153, or 25.8%, in the number of the possession of drugs for sale or supply offences recorded in the third quarter of 2006 compared to the third quarter period of 2005.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>In terms of the amount and value of heroin and cocaine seized since the beginning of this year and how this compares to the same period for 2005, the Garda authorities have provided me with the following data.</P>
        <P>For the first ten month period of 2005, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seized 12 kgs of heroin, with an estimated street value of &euro;2.4 million.  There has been a significant increase in the comparative period for this year with 115.75 kgs of the drug, with an estimated street value of &euro;23.15 million, having already being seized.</P>
        <P>For the first ten month period of 2005, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seized 212.6 kgs of cocaine with an estimated street value of &euro;14.882 million, and over the comparative period for 2006 seized 109.5 kgs of the drug, with an estimated street value of &euro;7.665 million.</P>
        <P>The Government would view with concern any apparent rise in the level of any illegal drugs being trafficked into this country.  However, the seizures could also be a reflection of the success of the garda&iacute; in targeting this illicit and pernicious trade.  The drugs situation is dictated by global developments.  It is dynamic and ever-changing and our policies need to be flexible to meet those changes.</P>
        <P>In terms of estimating the proportion of drug seizures made by our law enforcement authorities in relation to the overall volumes of drugs being trafficked, given the clandestine nature of this illegal activity this is extremely difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty.  What can be said though is that the global illicit drug trade is, <Col N="1723"/>according to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, UNODC, reputed to exceed billions of US dollars annually.  That UN office estimated in 2005 that global seizures for that year accounted for 44% of cocaine production, 28% of cannabis resin, 25% of opium production, 7% of amphetamines and 4.7% of ecstasy.</P>
        <P>In response to all of this data, the first point I wish to make, and I am sure Deputy Howlin and all Members of the House would support me, is to commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its ongoing operational success in tackling the problem of drug trafficking.  The continuing high level of drug seizures being made by the garda&iacute;, their continued success in bringing serious drug traffickers to book and their increasing detection of drug related offences as identified in the CSO report is to be warmly applauded.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, drug misuse remains one of the most complex social ills faced globally.  Our drug law enforcement response is a vital feature of our overall response in addressing the issue but we cannot just look at the issue from a supply reduction perspective only.  Rather, we must examine the drugs problem in the wider context in which it takes place and take cognisance of the fact that the demand for and the use of illegal drugs is what fuels the drugs trade.  The measures that we have put in place to address the problem must take account of that aspect.</P>
        <P>The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem through our National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.  The national strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.</P>
        <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is the lead Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy.  My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government&rsquo;s drug policy framework.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na invokes a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue.  These include the following: identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this State; conducting intelligence-driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade, including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing; working with other national and international law enforcement <Col N="1724"/>agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade; and working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.</P>
        <P>Tackling organised crime and drug trafficking is primarily achieved through the use of specialist units and targeted intelligence-led operations.  The organised crime unit, established in November 2005, in conjunction with the Garda national drugs unit and local garda&iacute;, continues to implement initiatives such as Operations Anvil and Oak, which target criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs.</P>
        <P>Significant drug seizures, including the considerable increase in the amount of heroin already seized this year to date, to which I referred earlier, have been made as a result of these operations, which are ongoing.  They continue to dismantle drug trafficking networks and have led to the arrest in recent times of major criminals based here and abroad who are involved in the drugs trade.</P>
        <P>The record level of resources, both in financial and personnel terms, being made available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year is proof of the Government&rsquo;s commitment and determination to ensure that the Garda authorities will continue to implement targeted, intelligence-led and high intensity operations against organised crime with a special focus on drugs crime.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, we are ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have a strong legislative platform from which to operate in their work tackling those involved in such criminal activity.  While our legislative package for tackling drug trafficking is already viewed as being one of the most stringent in Europe, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for further measures which will enhance the powers of the garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences.</P>
        <P>Nobody on the Government side is under any illusions on this issue.  Tackling drug trafficking and those involved in this destructive trade remains an ongoing work in progress and challenge to be met head on, but I clearly signal again that the policy of targeting those involved in organised crime, including drug trafficking and the gun culture with which it is associated, remains the Government&rsquo;s top policing priority.  It is a policy on which I assure the House we will continue to steadfastly and relentlessly pursue.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the most worrying fact in the statistics issued by the Central Statistics Office, and I welcome the involvement of the CSO in crime figures analysis and presentation, was the increase of 25.8% &mdash; more than a quarter &mdash; in the number of possession of drugs for sale or supply offences?  Obviously, interdicted drugs are all that manifest <Col N="1725"/>themselves, and I publicly welcome the vigilance of the garda&iacute; in some of the biggest seizures of drugs in the history of the State in the past few months, but will the Minister indicate to the House the accepted norm, that is, the relationship between interdicted drugs and the volume of drugs available in society?  I understand there is an internationally acceptable multiplier.  If the Minister has that multiplier, will he give it to the House so that we might have some view of the scale of the drugs problem?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister further accept that drugs are now the biggest single issue in regard to crime in this country?  Will he accept that the crime gangs are the biggest threat to public order in this country now that we have moved beyond criminality in terms of violence dressed up in the national cause?  Does the Minister share the nation&rsquo;s horror, and mine, that a five-year-old child would be shot in a housing estate in the third city of our nation recently?  Does the Minister have specific ongoing measures to put in place to ensure that the violence being perpetrated by drug gangs in this State is faced down and eliminated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I totally identify with the Deputy in regard to the incident in which a five-year-old child was shot.  Nothing could be more depraved or more indicative of the total disregard a tiny minority of people in some of our cities have for human life.  The people who earlier this year were shooting people on wasteland in Dublin or the people who are letting off weapons in pursuit of feuds in Limerick have no regard for human life and no respect for the law of our land.  The garda&iacute; in Limerick are putting in huge resources to counter that threat by a tiny minority of people who have unleashed violence upon each other and, inevitably, innocent third parties are the victims of such criminality.  Great efforts are being made at community level to improve every aspect of life in that estate and similar estates in Limerick.  We should not allow the actions of a tiny few who are behaving barbarously to drag down the reputation of a whole community or misrepresent the wonderful work being done in that community.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of the percentage of drugs interdicted internationally as a norm but I believe the Garda has made very substantial inroads in that regard in this State.  I join the Deputy in congratulating the Garda on its recent achievements in this area.</P>
        <P>For the first ten months of 2005, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seized 12 kg of heroin with an estimated value of &euro;2,400,000.  In the comparable period for this year, 115.75 kg of the drug, with an estimated street value of &euro;23,150,000, have already been seized.  This represents a significant increase.  It shows the Garda is achieving successes but also that these drugs are available to be seized.</P>

        <Quest>  the extent to which Garda call outs that do not result in an arrest are recorded; the numbers of such call outs that occurred throughout 2004 and 2005 in each Garda division; the person who is responsible for recording such incidents; if such statistics are used when determining the need for deployment of new personnel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[36554/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the statistical information requested by Deputy Murphy on Garda call outs is not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources on examining each individual incident recorded during 2004 and 2005 to identify whether it resulted in an arrest.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is to be hoped the great majority of call outs by the Garda will not result in an arrest.  Normal policing would not be a feature of society if an arrest were made in every case where a garda encountered a troublemaker.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that the recording of an incident on PULSE is not dependent on an arrest being made.  A wide variety of incidents is reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, ranging from the extremely serious, such as murder, manslaughter and rape, to the comparatively minor.  An incident does not necessarily involve the commission of a crime or offence in respect of which an arrest might be made.  It could just be a verbal altercation between neighbours.  The recording of an incident will, in the majority of cases, be done by the garda to whom the incident is reported.  In October 2004, I announced that I was proceeding with the recruitment of additional garda&iacute; and this is happening, as I indicated to Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
        <P>It is impossible to compile statistics such that one could divide the total number of incidents by the total number of arrests to reach some notion as to the effectiveness of policing.  If a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is brought out on a call, it does not necessarily mean an arrestable offence has been committed or that an arrest would be appropriate in the circumstances.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have left the scene and, in other cases, the issuing of a verbal warning to a troublemaker will be sufficient to deal with the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>My motivation for asking the question is that I could not find any statistics.  I am not requesting that great effort be made in their compilation.  I am being asked why the proportion of garda&iacute; to the population in my area is so low compared to elsewhere in the country.  Essentially the residents want to know how to <Col N="1727"/>influence this.  They say they are satisfied when the garda&iacute; respond to calls and they are not criticising garda&iacute; of any rank.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that there are insufficient numbers of garda&iacute;, particularly in rapidly developing areas.  Residents in such areas have asked me whether they should report incidents to the local Garda station and whether this would affect the determination of the number of garda&iacute; to be deployed in their area.  Is this considered side by side with the increase in population, for example?  When asked this by residents, I advised them to make complaints to the Garda so issues could be documented.</P>
        <P>Weekend after weekend, I receive complaints that garda&iacute; responding to calls cannot catch the perpetrators, in spite of doing the 100-yard dash after them into the woods or elsewhere.  There is evidence of damage to bus shelters, telephone boxes and other public properties and there is a great sense of frustration.  It is felt that the measurement of an area&rsquo;s needs is not determined by the critical mass of population but by how crimes are recorded or documented.  Will the Minister enlighten me on how a complaint about a serious problem is recorded when a call out in respect thereof does not result in an arrest?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  She is saying that if a local population believes it is under-policed and that, by making complaints, it will compile on paper a case for further garda&iacute; to be allocated to its area, it might be tempted to make such complaints.  However, the Commissioner must obviously adopt an objective approach and not just a view based on the fact that a certain group of residents is advised by the Deputy to adopt a particular course of action in respect of crime in its area.  The Commissioner is obliged when deploying garda&iacute; across the country to make the maximum use of those members.  Population growth in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency has been considerable in recent times and therefore the Commissioner is paying particular attention to such areas.  It is in such areas that the proportion of garda&iacute; to residents has declined most.</P>
        <P>If there had been no expansion in the force or extra recruitment since 1997 &mdash; there has been &mdash; many rural areas would now be in the process of being denuded of garda&iacute; to move them to areas such as the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency.  We are not in that position at present.</P>
        <P>There are two ways to deal with Garda numbers, the first of which is to recruit more garda&iacute;.  This is happening despite all the argument and allegations of spin.</P>

Both of these approaches are being pursued relentlessly by the Commissioner and I.  A reply, to be given later in this afternoon&rsquo;s proceedings, will show the pick-up in the rate of civilianisation.  The Commissioner and I will announce further steps this afternoon with a view to improving governance by placing further emphasis on the civilianisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

        <Quest>  if he intends to proceed with the Privacy Bill 2006 or withdraw it.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[36428/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Privacy Bill implements a commitment contained in the agreed programme for Government of 2002 that the Government would, &ldquo;in the context of a statutory Press Council and improved privacy laws, move to implement reforms of libel laws designed to bring them into line with those of other states&rdquo;.  The recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Wainwright case is of interest in the context of a need for legislative provision on privacy.  In that decision, which was handed down in September, the court found that in the circumstances in English law in which there was no general tort of invasion of privacy, the applicants did not have available to them a means of obtaining redress for the interference with their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.  This is of interest in that the court made a direct finding that the absence of a tort of invasion of privacy did not amount to a proper vindication of people&rsquo;s privacy rights under the convention.</P>
        <P>I also note that the Bill is now before the Seanad and is awaiting Second Stage debate there.  Fine Gael has suggested that the Bill should be withdrawn, whereas the Labour Party has welcomed the introduction of legislation in this area, in principle.</P>
        <P>The report of the working group on privacy, which led to the introduction of the Privacy Bill 2006, contained a number of key conclusions.  It pointed out that the absence of any clearly defined and comprehensive cause of action in Ireland to provide for a definite remedy for violations of privacy interests was undesirable.  It found that the arguments in favour of the introduction of such a clear statutory cause of action outweighed the arguments against it.  The working group, which was chaired by Mr. Brian Murray SC, evaluated the arguments for and against a written privacy law.</P>
        <P>I do not want to muzzle the media in any way.  For example, if a television presenter has just <Col N="1729"/>given birth to a child and a newspaper sends a photographer disguised as a nurse into the room where she is nursing her child in the first few hours after the birth, I want to ensure that the woman in question has an effective remedy against the newspaper in question.  That is not an imaginary case &mdash; many of us have knowledge of a case of that nature.  We have to protect people&rsquo;s rights without unduly affecting the rights of the media to cover matters of public importance.  It is difficult to achieve a balance between those two sets of rights.  I look forward to achieving that balance in the best way possible in the course of the passage of the legislation in question through the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>It seems to me that doing nothing is no longer a sustainable option, under European convention law, in the aftermath of the Wainwright case.  If that is not a sustainable option, we have to do something in this area.  Rather than arguing about points of abstract principle, I would prefer to argue about the nitty-gritty of the exact content of our privacy law to ensure it protects people who need protection.  We need to strip away the protection that the defamation law used to afford to people who abused it.  Such people were able to engage in misbehaviour in the sure and certain knowledge that our defamation and privacy law was such that they were protected to the detriment of the common good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My concern is that the Government&rsquo;s privacy legislation is dangerous.  It will cripple investigative journalism and gag the media, while doing nothing to protect the public.  I would like to discuss a couple of aspects of it with the Minister.  Does he accept that privacy rights are already protected under the Constitution?  Does he accept that there has been a recognition of the right to privacy not only by the Supreme Court, but also under this country&rsquo;s general jurisprudence since the cases of Geraldine Kennedy, Bruce Arnold and others?  Does the Minister accept that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been incorporated into domestic law, represents a further reinforcement of the right to privacy?  Does he accept that we have put in place legislative protections in specific areas, such as data protection?  There are restrictions on reporting in a number of other areas, such as children&rsquo;s cases.</P>
        <P>What caused the Minister&rsquo;s Pauline conversion?  I understand that he made it clear in the Seanad earlier this year that he was not convinced of the need for the statutory development of a privacy tort at this stage.  Does the Minister not accept that the proper approach would be to proceed with the changes in defamation law, which I think are necessary?  I will support those changes, subject to detail.  He should also proceed with the establishment of a press council and a press <Col N="1730"/>ombudsman with very strict guidelines.  While we should have done that long ago, we should certainly do it now.  We should not rush to make changes in an area in which there appears to be no urgent need for change, other than a certain anti-media approach on the part of some people.  If such an approach cannot be associated with the Minister, perhaps it can be associated with many of his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in the Cabinet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the general proposition that, as an academic principle, there is a right of privacy defended by the Constitution.  I can advance an unfortunate proposition, however.  In different circumstances, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe and I might not be Members of this House &mdash; we might be sitting behind our desks dealing with legal issues.  We might be contacted by a client who wants to know whether she can sue on a certain basis.  She might ask us whether she has a right of privacy that gives her a right to sue.  She might want to know whether she can sue in the Circuit Court or the High Court.  She might ask us whether she can take out an injunction against a newspaper that had taken photographs of her sunbathing in her back garden.  In such circumstances, we would have to tell her that we are not sure whether she can take a case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the lawyers would say that she could take a case but they could not guarantee that she would be successful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.  Deputy Howlin has interrupted in a disorderly manner to point out that many lawyers would tell such a client that while she could sue, they could not guarantee that she would win.  Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe asked about the origin of the Pauline conversion on my part.  The report of the group chaired by Mr. Brian Murray SC evaluated a view which I have expressed previously, which is that it might be better to have no statutory law and to allow judges to develop this law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That was earlier this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Murray group evaluated that proposition in the context of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Two things of importance have happened in the jurisprudence of Strasbourg.  First, as a result of the Caroline von Hannover case, there is now a clear statement that any old set of privacy laws will not do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That ruling was given in June of last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  In addition, following the Murray report&rsquo;s evaluation of the two issues, we now have the Wainwright decision.  The point that has just been made by the Deputy &mdash; that <Col N="1731"/>the provisions of Article 8 of the convention are enough &mdash; seems to have been canvassed before the European Court of Human Rights by British lawyers acting for the British state in that case.  They were told by the court that those provisions are not enough, as countries have to provide for an actionable right of invasion of privacy in their legal systems.  It is not enough to say that a mish-mash of other rights, such as the right to confidentiality, will do.  If the Wainwright decision has that implication&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

        <Quest>  the contacts or discussions he has had with the banks or financial institutions to deal with situations whereby staff members or their families are taken hostage in order to facilitate robberies; if there are agreed procedures between the banks and the garda&iacute; about the way such situations are dealt with; if his attention has been drawn to at least one case where a particular branch has ceased carrying out cash transactions due to a series of such raids; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[36430/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent incidents in which bank workers, non-bank workers and their families have been held captive with a view to assisting robberies are clearly a cause of great concern.  The phenomenon of tiger kidnappings has been translated from the paramilitary world <Col N="1732"/>into the ordinary criminal world.  Determined criminals use any opportunity to further their illegal activities.  The targeting of family members to put pressure on those with access to cash is another manifestation of their ruthless attitude.</P>
        <P>In my meetings with representatives of the banking and security industries this year, I have made it clear that I expect the highest security standards to be adhered to by their members.  As the Deputy would expect, there are regular contacts between the banks and other financial institutions and the Garda to discuss methods of forestalling attempts by criminal gangs to enrich themselves by preying on the vulnerability of individuals.  There is a forum in which representatives of the various interest groups meet, in line with agreed operational standards and procedures.</P>
        <P>Every bank, financial institution and company with large deposits of cash owes it to itself and its employees to put in place a system which deters tiger kidnappings.  It has been disclosed to me on a preliminary basis that Garda investigations in a recent case strongly indicate that proper procedures were not in place in a certain bank to protect employees from crimes of this nature.  With fear and ordinary human emotion, one can well imagine that decisions would be made to make cash available to victims of tiger kidnappings without alerting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Although one could see something like this happening through fear, to do so is to set up the next family for this kind of crime.  The decision that any bank, bank manager or employee makes in respect of one incident will inevitably have consequences for another family.  If this tactic is seen to succeed and people are seen to circumvent standardised procedures such as notifying the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, having time-locked safes or putting in place a system of warnings, they may take the pressure off themselves on a particular occasion, but those who perpetrate such crimes will inevitably target other innocent families and subject them to the same ordeal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is surely not proposing that banks expose their staff to this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am suggesting the exact opposite.  Any bank that does not take stern measures to deal with this threat is exposing its employees and the employees of other banks to this threat.  There is no excusing corner-cutting by the banks on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not a disinterested party in these matters.  He is not an independent security consultant advising banks.  Does the Minister not accept that he is the person to whom the public looks to protect them against attacks of this nature?  Given that five so-called tiger robberies took place in an eight-month period this year, does he accept that this is a serious and real <Col N="1733"/>issue?  Does he accept that it is rather brave of him to counsel others that they should not behave in such a way as to encourage other criminals by putting their own families at risk?  Is that what the Minister is counselling when he suggests that it is somehow the fault of the individuals for whom the lives of their families or children have been threatened?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a dangerous suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister suggesting that these people should stand up to this?  If this type of terror robbery is to be faced down and dealt with, I ask that it be done as a co-ordinated response from not only the banks &mdash; at least one of the robberies concerned a supermarket manager.  What co-ordination has taken place with the business community, including the banks, to ensure protocols are put in place, by statute if necessary, to make it impossible for individuals to have access to substantial hoards of cash in the dark hours of the night or the early hours of the morning?  We must make it as difficult as is humanly practicable for this kind of terror raid to yield profit.  Will the Minister give the details of the actions he has taken to prevent this new terror from continuing in this State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the majority of these raids have happened to deposit-taking institutions and banks.  I have established a forum comprising the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, cash-holders and cash in transit companies to discuss these matters.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that I do not blame the victims in tiger kidnappings.  However, victims are made vulnerable if the systems are not in place to defend them.  Large sums of cash in a bank are either held in time-locked safes or they are not.  When the time lock allows the bank&rsquo;s safes to be opened, there are either systems in place to counteract tiger kidnapping or there are not.  There are either protocols of behaviour in existence or there are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister drawn up such protocols and made them mandatory?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Where somebody in authority in a bank knows that another employee is the subject of a tiger kidnapping, there must be a system for reporting this.  The Deputy asked if I had made such protocols mandatory.  The only method whereby I could make them mandatory is to make them a term of the licence of the banks licensed by IFSRA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister could introduce criminal justice legislation to achieve this too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have discussed this option with the banks regarding the cash in transit issue. <Col N="1734"/> I have indicated to them that whereas the Private Security Authority can regulate the cash in transit industry, I see the banks responsibilities as being equally serious.  I have also indicated that if voluntary adherence to codes of conduct were not sufficient, I would ask the Minister of Finance to instruct IFSRA to generate a legislative framework putting in place mandatory procedural arrangements to protect bank employees.</P>
        <P>However, supermarkets and pubs also hold large sums of money and mandatory regimes become unworkable at some point.  One cannot instruct the proprietor of a pub chain to put in place time-lock systems on safes or protocols for bar managers should any of them be subject to tiger kidnapping.  It is difficult to achieve this at the retail end of cash-holding enterprises.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that I do not blame the victim.  However, anyone who pays out without informing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is teeing up another family for exactly the same experience.</P>

The regulations which I modified following a series of representations made to me are a huge improvement on the old ones.  It is not a matter of me clicking my fingers and stating my view.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I might ask about the regulations.  It was no one on this side of the House who said that the disciplinary regulations would be in place by the summer recess, it was the Minister who gave that assurance on 19 May.  He set that deadline for the conclusion of his statutory obligation to consult.  In subsequent parliamentary questions, he said that he has extended the deadline beyond the summer recess.  Now he says that he is simply obliged to continue the consultation period, presumably for many more weeks.</P>
        <P>Breaches of discipline are serious and the code is important.  It was greeted with fanfare on the day of the Morris report&rsquo;s publication as the Minister&rsquo;s immediate considered response.  I do not expect the Minister to accept this, but it seems that it was simply a contrivance to get through the day.  We have still not got the procedures in place months after the Minister gave a firm commitment to this House that they would be introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret to inform the Deputy that that is not so.  I have been very clear in what I want in the regulations, but I must consult others.  It would be very easy for me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The deadline reflected my expectation at the time, but I cannot simply click my fingers and declare the process of consultation over as I must ensure that I am being fair.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as Mr. Justice Morris said in his tribunal report, the current procedure is like that for a murder trial but for relatively small infractions of the disciplinary code.  I must sweep all that away and introduce an entirely different code.  In so far as I can, on a basis of partnership I must bring the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na representative associations with me.</P>

	<P>I was horrified to learn of an apparent fracas involving two members of the Garda, one on armed protection duty, outside the US Embassy in Dublin.  I appreciate the Minister is unable at this stage to answer a specific question, but I wish to ask a general question.  What supervision is in place for those assigned to duties of that kind?  Reading of the incident, it seemed that the apparent dereliction of duty extended over an extremely long period.  Is the Minister satisfied that there is generally adequate supervision of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to such duties?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to comment on the individual case, but there is a system of sergeants and inspectors whose functions include ensuring that people are at their post, are sober and so on.  It goes without saying that if any superior officer had any inkling that an incident of that kind was taking place, he or she would have acted immediately.  The circumstances were extremely unusual and most people in this House would not even have dared to write them in fiction.  However, that is how things turned out.</P>

However, earlier this year my Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and <Col N="1737"/>Local Government and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs initiated a pilot project, the GRO initiative, aimed specifically at combating graffiti in Dublin city, Galway city and Bray, County Wicklow.  The project is separate from, and in addition to, the graffiti abatement programmes run on an ongoing basis by the local authorities.</P>
        <P>The GRO initiative involves an initial major clean-up of the worst-affected sites in the pilot areas followed by a rapid response cleaning maintenance programme aimed at keeping sites free of graffiti.  Following a tendering process completed in July, a total of seven contractors were engaged to carry out the initial clean-up operation, which commenced in August.  Those contractors will also be responsible for the ongoing cleaning maintenance programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To date all sites in RAPID areas have been addressed and significant cleaning works have been completed.  Work has been completed or is in progress in 19 separate locations as follows.  In the Dublin City Council area, they are Ballymun; Finglas; the north-east inner city, East Wall area; the north-west inner city, the area bordered by Parnell Square, Parnell Street, the Four Courts and Kings Inns; on the north side, Coolock and Darndale; in the south-east inner city, the area bordered by the Quays, Westmoreland Street, Pearse Street, Westland Row and Macken Street; in the south-west inner city, the Dolphin's Barn area; in the south inner city, the area bordered by St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dolphins Barn, Marrowbone Lane, Thomas Street and James&rsquo;s Street; and Ballyfermot.  In the Bray Town Council area, they are Hazelwood-Dargle Heights; Kilbride Grove; Ballywaltrim Heights; Oldcourt; and Ashfield Ballymorris.  In the Galway City Council area they are Westside; Ballinfoile; Bohermore; New Mervue; and Ballybane.</P>
        <P>Sites affected by graffiti outside RAPID areas are currently being surveyed with a view to extending the GRO initiative to them in coming weeks.  We were initially going to confine the initiative to RAPID areas, but afterwards we decided that it would be a major policy mistake since the graffiti artists would simply find out where the RAPID area was and move elsewhere with a sense of impunity.  We decided to go to RAPID areas first since the greatest concentration of graffiti vandalism has been there, after which we would go to other areas.</P>
        <P>The pilot project is overseen by a steering group comprising representatives from the three Departments, and an independent evaluation of the programme has been commissioned to determine its effectiveness.  Should the programme prove successful, consideration will be given to extending it to other areas and to other methods of assisting local authorities to make a real and <Col N="1738"/>determined effort to have rapid reaction units deal with graffiti vandalism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister will agree that in some cases producing graffiti can be a legitimate form of artistic, political and cultural expression, but in many, if not most, cases, it is an act of downright vandalism that diminishes the community where it is committed.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that it is not enough simply to undertake a clean-up or ongoing maintenance without addressing the underlying causes of graffiti?  Does he accept that we need more community policing on the ground and greater provision of amenities for young people?  Will he consider prioritising for attention some of the fine stone and brick buildings defaced in recent years?  There was a trend in years gone by to tackle concrete walls or the rear of buildings, but more recently we have seen fine protected structures and other buildings being destroyed by the worst kind of graffiti.  Will the Minister ensure that priority is given to stone and brick buildings at risk of being defaced?</P>
        <P>The fundamental point is this.  Will the Minister accept that we must not simply undertake a clean-up but also work much more strongly with young people through community policing, using garda&iacute; on bicycles and other measures, and provide amenities for them?  I am very familiar with an area in my constituency that has seen a veritable explosion of graffiti.  There is no swimming pool for miles and although there is a leisure centre, it does not have sufficient resources to cope with the young population locally.  We need significant investment in providing amenities for young people as well as cleaning up the graffiti.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My experience has been that even in very well policed areas, those who term themselves &ldquo;graffiti artists&rdquo;, whom I call &ldquo;graffiti vandals&rdquo;, will carry out their work.  Second, I am not inclined to agree with the proposition that there are legitimate and illegitimate graffiti.  The fact that some vandals are technically more skilled than others does not excuse what they do.  If there is a call for bare walls to be made available for people with artistic urges to express themselves, it is a matter for local authorities rather than for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Those bare walls are only in certain places.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are plenty of big, high walls.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Might the Minister consider making available suitable places for young people to express their artistic skills?  The interior of the former Blackrock baths is the location of some fine artistic expression.  This encapsulates the problem, namely, that a public amenity controlled by the local authority is lying derelict.  In this instance, the young people are simply giving <Col N="1739"/>vent to their frustration regarding the lack of amenities being provided for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that frustration at the lack of amenities leads a person to purchase various cans of spray paint, to spend a night mapping out his or her proposed work of graffiti and to return to complete it on another occasion.  I do not think this represents a cry for help regarding the provision of more swimming pools.  I do not accept that proposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister seems well acquainted with the techniques involved.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there have been 16 murders with firearms from the beginning of the year to 6 November.  I am also informed that detections have been made in seven of these cases, with proceedings commenced in four.</P>
        <P>All killings regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigations by the Garda authorities.  The identification of the motive and the evidence available in its support are key elements of the investigation and prosecution process.  Operation Anvil has been extended nationwide and the level of resources provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to counter the threat of the use of firearms has been massively increased.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of the weapons amnesty, mandatory minimum sentences in respect of possession of firearms came into effect on 1 November.  The penalties available to the courts have now been greatly strengthened.  Stringent penalties now apply and, as Members are familiar with them, I will not read them into the record.</P>
        <P>The new law specifies that the courts may exercise discretion to impose less than the minimum sentence only where it is satisfied that there are exceptional and specific circumstances for so doing.  In addition, they may exercise their discretion only in the case of a first offence.  There is no discretion whatsoever in respect of a second offence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that most people are horrified by the increased use of guns by thugs and gangsters?  Does he agree that the most shocking aspect relating to the use of guns, particularly as it relates to the commission of murder, is the falling rates of detection and prosecution?  Does he accept that 109 murders involving the use of firearms were committed between 1998 and June of this year, that the Garda detected the perpetrators in 54 of these cases, or 49% of the total, that court proceedings arose in 35 of these cases, or 32% of the total, and that court convictions were obtained in 18 cases, or 17% of the total?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister concerned that people in this jurisdiction use weapons and are of the opinion that they can do so with impunity?  Is he of the view that a conviction rate of 17% over eight years is lamentable?  Does he believe that there is a need to take other measures to ensure that the use of firearms will be brought to an end?  On the Criminal Justice Act 2006, will he confirm that mandatory prison sentences for firearms offences be commenced?  Has the commencement order in this regard been signed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Mandatory minimum sentences were introduced on 1 November.  That is why the weapons amnesty expired the previous day.  Such sentences are now contemplated under the law and I look forward to their being vigorously imposed by members of the Judiciary to whom it falls to implement the new law.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that people, particularly those involved in gangland situations, seem to believe they can get away with the use of firearms.  There are certain reasons for that.  There is a culture of silence around these gangs and also one involving the intimidation of witnesses.  The Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Justice Act 2006 makes provision for the use of statements against intimidated or unwilling witnesses.</P>
        <P>As regards breaking open these gangs and dealing with the wall of silence with which investigating garda&iacute; are frequently confronted, the rebalancing committee of the criminal law, which has just been established, will examine some measures that were proposed by Members of the House, not least by Deputy Howlin, and I look forward to its early report.  In my opinion, we may be obliged to go further than what were quite severe steps in the Criminal Justice Act to ensure that those people who resort to the right to silence and believe that they can stare at a point on the wall when being interviewed should fall under the same pressure to give a proper account of themselves as, for example, those who <Col N="1741"/>are suspected, under the post-Omagh legislation, of committing atrocities.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</Title>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard some reports that the Taoiseach referred to a utopian Ireland at the weekend.  Olivia Crawford did not realise that her son had been shot until he collapsed in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor.  Jordan Crawford was a lucky child.  Garda&iacute; stated that he could have received multiple injuries if the machine gun had not jammed.  Jordan Crawford&rsquo;s family was already on a warning because its home was riddled with bullets on Thursday night.</P>
        <P>The drive-by shooting in Limerick at the weekend was different because unlike others that were gunned down in a war that has exploded on the <Col N="1742"/>Taoiseach&rsquo;s watch, Jordan Crawford was not known to the Garda and is not associated with the underworld.  He is only five years of age.  Instead of joining in providing class news at his school, Jordan is the news and is lucky to be recovering in the sunshine ward of Limerick Regional Hospital.  This is all apparently because he took a bullet that was intended for his uncle but it is all actually because the Government has failed spectacularly to deal with serious crime, particularly that which is gang-related.  The new recruits or gunmen who carry out such crime are not men at all, they are children.  Psychopathic gangs are recruiting children who have no fear, respect, personal boundaries or moral code.  It is no wonder that events of this nature are occurring.</P>
        <P>How many major crime bosses were imprisoned in the past five years?  The answer is &ldquo;None&rdquo;.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has left the Chamber, had the gall to come before the House and dismiss such individuals as the last sting of a dying wasp.  Some sting, some wasp.  On the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s watch and during the Government&rsquo;s time in office, Ireland has, in the context of violence, gone to the dogs.</P>
        <P>It is not just organised crime.  Rapes, murders, stabbings and beatings are an everyday part of life in urban and rural areas.  In the year to September, there were 64 violent deaths.  This is the position on the watch of the most vain Minister for Justice ever.  In the year to September, there were 304 discharges of firearms, an increase of 40%, and 362 reported rapes.  These are not my figures, nor are they the Taoiseach&rsquo;s; they were provided by the CSO.  The National Museum might be glad to obtain for exhibition some of the weapons received under the arms amnesty.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach should go again to Moyross and tell Olivia Crawford and her people what this Government is doing to deal with the issue on the streets there every night.  The heroin that has decimated parts of this and other cities has had the same effect there.  What does the Taoiseach intend to do &mdash; let loose the Minister for Defence?  I would like to hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny asked about Moyross in particular.  There is a very good community in Moyross.  There is a very committed group of people in Moyross who are, and have been for some time, doing their utmost across a range of services.  From youth groups and senior citizens&rsquo; groups to people working in the home and people looking after children, they are doing their best to deal with the difficulties there.  They are asking the State, across a range of areas from garda&iacute; and special detective units to a special task force, to deal with a fairly small, but hardened and dangerous group of criminals who operate in <Col N="1743"/>that community &mdash; as happens in other communities too.</P>
        <P>There is no shortage of resources.  The Garda, through its special units, extra garda&iacute;, Garda overtime and the garda&iacute; in the specialist groups, with both dogs and horses, is trying to detect drugs at checkpoints in the community and in the area.  The Government has asked the former Dublin city manager, a Limerick man, John Fitzgerald, to co-ordinate the activities across a range of services to try to tackle this.</P>
        <P>I agree there is a dangerous group.  It is not the only part of the country where there is a dangerous group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>When I met them about four weeks ago they presented me with a report, which they had prepared over the course of the year and in which they asked for a range of activities to address it.  It is a difficult area.  They pointed out to me the surrounding countryside where there are approximately 100 acres of land on which there is only one industry employing 40 or 50 local people.</P>

	<P>A short distance away land costs several million euro an acre.  What they have been asking for is a development plan, which would look at issues like access to the estates, zoning of the land for business purposes <Col N="1744"/>and high protection, and they have been given that.</P>
        <P>There is nowhere else in the country where I have seen, both personally and in records, such a level of garda&iacute; engaged in protecting, looking after and securing an area as in Moyross.  It is a pity there is an area which requires that, but that is the reality.  The resources have been given to bring back normality and to break and arrest the criminal element.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny spoke of hardened criminals.  In my constituency and elsewhere in Dublin, and in other parts of the country, there have been numerous hardened criminals who received long sentences.  Thankfully, long tough sentences have been given out by the courts.</P>

	<P>That does not take away from the problem that we are dealing with, and the garda&iacute; and the special detective unit increasingly are landing large hits against the criminal gangs in terms of detections, arrests and confiscation of drugs and arms.  We can see there is a minority of hardened criminals who believe this is a fast way of making themselves rich and who disregard the law and democracy.  That is why we are spending such significant resources on a highly sophisticated Garda.</P>
        <P>I spoke earlier about Moyross, while the shooting yesterday occurred in Southill.  Moyross is a particular area where there is a difficult group who must be dealt with and the garda&iacute; are doing so.  On the other side of it, there are decent people who want to make a better community and who are asking for resources for that.  They have some excellent, top class facilities in the area.  They are asking for further assistance, which they are getting.  To co-ordinate that, the Government has put a particular plan in place for that community, as it has done in other areas, and pooled together State resources to do that, which we will continue to do.  This area needs attention and we have moved on that.  The Minister for Defence, who has first hand knowledge of Moyross, presented to us the issues we need to address to help the area and we have done that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Anti-Racist Workplace Week and it is appropriate that the D&aacute;il should mark that.  It coincides with the publication of the first major survey, conducted by the ESRI, on the incidence of racism in our society.  The survey <Col N="1748"/>concludes that the incidence of racism in Ireland is lower than in other European countries, particularly in southern Europe, but the ESRI says there is no reason to be complacent as a result.  The figures set out in the survey are quite serious.  More than one in three immigrants experiences harassment, more than 20% experience job discrimination, a similar percentage experiences being passed over for promotion and others are denied access to credit and loan finance.  The graph is very telling in terms of casual discrimination against immigrants, for example, in shops and restaurants and so on.</P>
        <P>The Government published its report, Planning for Diversity &mdash; The National Action Plan Against Racism 2005-2008, last year.  I do not have a serious quibble with the philosophy or goals set out in the report, except that underpinning it with only &euro;1 million means the good sentiments in the report cannot be taken at face value, when one considers the scale of discrimination exposed in the ESRI report and that this is our first generation of immigrants.  We do not yet have second generation immigrants and the ESRI warns to us to beware as a result.</P>

	<P>In particular, can I ask the Taoiseach about the recommendations in the national consultative committee report, the ESRI report or his own report, where he refers to enhancing the ability of the Garda to combat racist crime?  What are the results in that regard?  With regard to new recruits, is the intake of non-nationals into the Garda statistically significant?  What does the Government propose to do about the national consultative committee recommendation that it should review the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989?</P>
        <P>I refer to the ESRI&rsquo;s conclusion that a fundamental barrier to integration is language and that good provision of language training facilities is essential.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In conclusion, the Taoiseach will be aware from the Minister for Education and Science who is sitting beside him that, for example, no matter how many non-national children are in a school, the resource teacher-pupil ratio is 1:14 and a cap of two additional teachers or 28 children is in place.  After that the school must make an arbitrary case in the hope it might obtain more specialist teaching back up.  I was in a school recently in my constituency with 180 non-national children.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1749"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The additional support for the school is capped at three teachers.  Is that not inadequate?  Can I ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is two and a half minutes over his time.  I ask him to allow the Taoiseach to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the report, which was conducted as part of a survey involving 12 EU member states to assess the prevalence of racism and discrimination, as experienced by people themselves.  The main benefit of the report is that one is getting a view from the street.  While there were many positive aspects to the report, I will ignore them and examine the two difficulties.  A total of 35% of migrants surveyed in Ireland reported harassment in public places or on public transport, which is a common form of discrimination.  That is a high percentage, as it is one third of all those who have entered the country.  The second issue that is worrying is that, among those entitled to work, insults or other forms of harassment at work were the second highest form of discrimination at 32% of those surveyed, which is also a high percentage.  While the report highlighted many good aspects for eastern Europeans, the bad news is that black Africans experience the most discrimination and they are targeted by people, according to the figures.  Asylum seekers are more likely to report discrimination than work permit holders.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about the national action plan against racism.  The sum of &euro;1 million covers administration, as resources underpinning the plan are provided by a large number of Departments, including the Department of Education and Science, which as the Deputy stated, continually puts in a large amount of resources.  He correctly highlighted the language issue.  However, the five objectives of the national action plan are effective protection and redress against racism, economic inclusion and equality of opportunity, accommodating diversity in service provision, recognition and awareness of diversity and full participation in Irish society.  We have been working on two planks for a number of years.  Society generally, comprising our own population and immigrants or new Irish, who amount to 10% of our workforce, must look on the system of people entering the country to be fair and the applications system to be credible and, when they become part of our society, they should be treated equally.  Surveys in other countries with long-term immigration problems highlighted that these two issues had to be addressed.  How they are integrated into the system copperfastens that.</P>
        <P>Education is a challenge because many primary schools cater for several dozen nationalities.  A total of 800 teachers have been teaching English to immigrants, which is a significant number, con<Col N="1750"/>sidering only a handful did so up to a few years ago.  An additional 500 teachers will be appointed to work on curricula in a variety of languages.  The Minister has introduced new schemes and will bring in others to make it easier to get redress when a number of nationalities are catered for in a school.</P>
        <P>The national action plan was launched at the beginning of last year.  Two Bills are being prepared by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as a result of a number of initiatives, to deal with migrant workers, which I hope will deal with the second most serious issue, discrimination in the workplace.  The provision last year for asylum and immigration issues was &euro;140 million, which is significant, while &euro;5 million will be spent on integration issues at the outset.  Across asylum, immigration, education and the workforce, substantial resources are being put in.  All the time, Departments are looking at and listening to frontline agencies to see what more we must do.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte, every report I have seen and every presentation I have attended on this matter stated that the problems are not with the first generation, but the second generation.  That is a cause of concern and we have a chance to try to address it during a short period of time.  Whether it is the Jewish or Muslim faith or another nationality, I have endeavoured to show it due regard and have encouraged my Ministers to do so.</P>
        <P>There is an issue of respect for our laws that we must work through.  To be frank, we are talking about recent crime issues, and there must be a stick and carrot element in this.  I am sure the Deputy has seen in his constituency that the racist attacks on Irish citizens in general and women in particular has increased rapidly.  I have plainly told the representative organisations, most of which happen to be based in Dublin-Central, not because it is my constituency but because it is the centre of the city, that they have a responsibility to get their communities to adhere to the law.  We have a job to do and we must work closely with the organisations to ensure that practices on our side are stopped and that our culture is respected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Taoiseach states that 800 teachers are involved in this area, I accept his word, but there is one teacher for every 14 children and two teachers for every 28 pupils, but no more thereafter unless a special case is made.  Many schools in different parts of the country, particularly this city, have immensely more than 28 children.  In terms of workplace harassment and language training, particularly in English, does the Taoiseach see a role for F&Aacute;S?  If there is low unemployment, one would have thought that the resources of F&Aacute;S would be redirected to play a role in this regard.</P><Col N="1751"/>
        <P>Regarding the ESRI report, while the response in respect of the Garda is reasonably positive in general, the response as it relates to immigrants interacting with the immigration service is of concern.  Those of us whose job it is to occasionally and not infrequently mediate with the immigration service find it difficult, to put it at its mildest, to get speedy responses or to be assured that the characteristics of different cases are weighed up.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that immigrants are denied access to credit is a major issue.  In a society that is based on the availability of credit, when normal credit institutions do not make credit available to immigrants, that invites major problems.  Are there plans to devise a scheme, for example, in conjunction with the credit union movement that might address that issue?</P>
        <P>Given the incidents to which the Taoiseach referred and those experienced in other parts of the country, is it not obvious that there is a necessity for the State to be more proactive if only in terms of public advertising?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Education and Science informs me that the 800 teachers are involved solely in language training and have no other duties.  In schools of under 14 pupils, a grant will be given towards obtaining the relevant services.</P>
        <P>I will raise the issue of F&Aacute;S with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, but I understand from the F&Aacute;S director general that there has been a large take-up of F&Aacute;S courses by immigrants.  I am not sure about the language training element, but I will check that.  There is a large take-up of adult literacy and language classes by immigrants throughout the country, particularly in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>On the credit issue, I am unaware of any scheme with the credit unions, but I will ask for the matter to be checked.</P>
        <P>On the immigration service, we approved the establishment of the Irish naturalisation and immigration service last year and appointed a director general last summer.  That service operates as a one-stop shop for immigration purposes.  It has an immigration integration unit to promote and co-ordinate social and organisational measures across a spectrum of Departments, which work in a group to co-ordinate Government actions in these areas for the acceptance of lawful immigrants into Irish economic and cultural life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not aware of the exact number of garda&iacute; in question, but the Garda has a policy of positive discrimination in terms of accepting a number of recruits from the immigrant population so that <Col N="1752"/>the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will comprise immigrants who can deal with people in their communities who have difficulties or get into trouble with the law.</P>
        <P>The main effort must be in integration, but there are problems.  The last anti-racism advertising campaign was held last year that featured a number of high profile Irish personalities in sport and the arts to try to encourage people to be pro-immigration.</P>

	<P>From briefings with senior garda&iacute;, I know that they have been working very closely with a number of different groups to try to deal with some of the criminal matters that are creeping into society via immigrants.  There are difficulties in this regard, but the Garda is trying to resource the issue, which has become a feature during the past year or so.</P>

        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that since that opportunity last week, an independent international panel on collusion in sectarian killings published a substantive report that addresses more than 70 deaths attributable to those who planned and carried out their actions from the infamous Mitchell farm at Glenanne in County Armagh, which was a militant Unionist base?  Is the Taoiseach aware that in 24 of the 25 specific attacks examined by this international independent panel, there is significant and credible evidence, in its opinion, of involvement by police and military agents both directly and in collusion with loyalist extremists?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the panel also found that at least some police superiors in the North of Ireland knew of an expressed approval of instances of this conduct and that senior officials in London had information sufficient to put them on notice of the serious risk of this conduct?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the independent international panel on alleged collusion in sectarian killings in Northern Ireland was launched in Belfast and Dublin yesterday.  The panel met with officials after the launch to brief them on the contents of the report and the panel&rsquo;s findings and recommendations.  We are up to date with the issue and are pursuing it.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has been issued with a copy of the detailed report and officials are studying any new detail that it might contain.  The report draws heavily on what we discussed earlier, namely, the work done by Mr. Justice Henry Barron, and much of the panel&rsquo;s inquiries mirrors his investigation.  I assume it referred to his document because, from what I saw of the report, it draws on the work he did.  It also highlights the good work done by this House and the relevant sub-committee.</P>
        <P>It is well recorded that concerns about collusion were a persistent issue for the Government during the Troubles.  Unfortunately, we may never achieve full clarity on what happened but for the past six years I have been pressing the British Government on the issue.  At Weston Park, over five and a half years ago, we obtained agreement on the establishment of an international examination of these issues by Mr. Justice Peter Cory, a very eminent member of the Canadian Supreme Court and internationally acclaimed by members of the world&rsquo;s Judiciary long before he was involved in this issue.  He has put his report into the public domain so all these things have a consistent thread.  Regarding the inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, we have <Col N="1754"/>argued very strongly internationally &mdash; in the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union &mdash; that the inquiry be conducted in the comprehensive manner recommended by Mr. Justice Peter Cory.  That approach is replicated in many other cases, although not in every single one.  Instead, we decided to focus our efforts on certain cases.</P>
        <P>The Pat Finucane Centre commissioned Professor Douglass Cassel to establish an independent panel of experts to consider allegations of loyalist collusion in Northern Ireland in the 1970s.  Among the incidents they investigated were the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan and others, including the Miami Showband massacre.  That report found that senior Royal Ulster Constabulary officers were aware and approved of collusion while officials in London had enough information to intervene.  That is all on the record.  The report calls on the British Government to appoint an independent inquiry to examine how high the collusion went in the chain of command.  The report also states the panel received allegations of alleged failure on the part of garda&iacute; and the Irish authorities to properly co-operate with law enforcement in cases of violence against loyalists in Northern Ireland and it has signalled that it intends to raise this matter with the Irish Government.  Officials have held a meeting with the panel on these issues today.</P>
        <P>We will pursue these issues and keep up the campaign to persuade the British Government.  I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will appreciate, from what I have said, that we have had difficulty obtaining co-operation from the British Government to the fullest extent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that we no longer have mounting evidence but a mountain of evidence of the extent of the collusion that took place?  Does he not agree that the report now presented, which covers 74 murders, including the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, amounts to a further statement of the need for a full international public inquiry?  Will the Taoiseach now act?  The responsibility for action is primarily his, specifically on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings but also on the other points of investigation by both Mr. Justice Hamilton and Mr. Justice Barron.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This further report, by an independent international panel, is further evidence and must spur action on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s part.  It cannot be left to Justice for the Forgotten to be a lone voice on this matter.  It is tragic that such an important issue, involving the single greatest loss of life throughout the Troubles, has not interested even one member of the media to stay for this, the third leader&rsquo;s question this afternoon.</P>

        <P>Will the Taoiseach take the critical step of establishing such an inquiry?  Will he also establish an inquiry, separate from the one critically focusing on who was responsible for the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, into why, as he mentioned earlier this afternoon, garda&iacute; closed the files on the investigation into the bombings three months after that tragedy was visited on this city and my home town back in May 1974?  Are there not questions to be answered in that regard?  Will he take the appropriate steps to establish the full facts on that aspect of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings not only for the victims, the bereaved and the survivors, but for all who want to see truth and justice prevail on that atrocity?</P>

	<P>I have painstakingly followed all these issues for the past number of years.

All those reports contain recommendations and work on them is being done, as it will continue to be.  We have pressed the recommendations of Mr. Justice Cory and will continue to do so.  In terms of the Finucane family&rsquo;s case, we have supported and called for a fully sworn inquiry under an Act that will allow full investigation.  We have co-operated with all the human rights groups on these issues.  </P>

We continue, internationally and with the British Government, to press for progress on the issues for the sake of families, relatives and victims.

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need to avoid the unnecessary removal from the voting register of thousands of qualified voters by introducing a comprehensive and accurate voters register in all <Col N="1756"/>constituencies where all voters are registered on the basis of their personal PPS number.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the use of banned chemicals and the violation of labour standards by a company, which I will not name but which was discussed on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo;; the failure of the Department of Agriculture and Food to regulate the use of these chemicals and prevent them from entering the food chain; and the failure of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to uphold labour standards and protect employees of the business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the critical need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to respond positively to the recent proposal to establish a commission of inquiry to resolve the refinery impasse at Bellanaboy and all other related matters in view of the urgent necessity of commencing a dialogue between the people of Erris and north Mayo and Shell and its partners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, today&rsquo;s report of the independent international panel which was hosted by Justice for the Forgotten with the Pat Finucane Centre which examined 25 cases on both sides of the Border where collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and State agents was alleged, and the urgent need for the Irish and British Governments to hold a special summit on this urgent matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the great potential in terms of hydrocarbon resources that the north Atlantic has to offer and that these waters are underexplored, with only nine exploration wells drilled in the past ten years and only two major finds; and the recent oil industry assessments of yet-to-find resource potential indicating in excess of 10 billion barrels of oil, which is worth &euro;500 billion to &euro;600 billion, which can be effectively and efficiently explored using modern technology and evaluation methods, which is in contradiction to Government pessimism of hydrocarbon resources potential off our coast.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the recommendations of the Labour Court on the redundancy agreement for the workers of Irish Sugar in Carlow and Mallow and the company&rsquo;s continued <Col N="1757"/>failure to fulfil its obligations as set down by the court in breach of the European Union Council regulation covering the sugar industry restructuring aid.</P>

	<P>Se&aacute;n Lemass used to say that Fianna F&aacute;il was slightly constitutional.  In fairness, the question is not far off the mark.

There are 70 heads in the <Col N="1758"/>immigration and residence Bill and these have just been approved.  The Bill is due in 2007 but I do not have a definite date on it.

	<P>It appears the state of the electoral register after the refurbishment is worse than it was before we started out.  What action does the Government intend to take&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and he said he probably deserved it the first four times and he certainly deserved it the last three times.  Similarly, I think a question about the state of the electoral register on the Order of Business is entirely appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an appropriate question for the line Minister and there are many ways the Deputy can raise the matter in the House, but it is not appropriate on the Order of Business.  The Deputy could have raised the matter on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>May I put it this way?  Will the Taoiseach provide time in the House to debate the grossly inadequate state of the electoral register?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a second matter.  Do I understand the Taoiseach to have said today at Question Time that there is no prospect of a referendum on the children&rsquo;s issue before the general election or did he say that it is an open question because he must discuss the issue with the rest of us?  I know that will weigh heavily on him.  Will he be clearer?  Will there be a referendum before the general election?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1759"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If I state that we must have it by a particular time, taking into account the consultation process, people will say that I am being prescriptive in trying to decide it.  It is an open question.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is available and ready to enter into dialogue with the political parties and the many NGO organisations with an interest in this issue and has been talking to them over recent months prior to the UN meeting.  If we can agree on the wording, I am happy to have the referendum whenever possible.  It may be included with other issues, before the general election or with the election.  I am totally open on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will we have a debate on the state of the electoral register?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I can ask for a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Only on promised debates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be as well for the Ceann Comhairle to shut the House down altogether.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It might suit the Deputy to stay within Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important matter.  Will the Taoiseach provide time for us to have a discussion on the matter or will he say what measures will be taken to make the register representative of the number of people who are entitled to vote?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The second question is out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot answer the second question.  The Minister has asked that the relevant Oireachtas committee meet so that he can make a presentation on the matter.  There is a good and positive story to tell.  There is also the requirement where the House can help to ensure the register is completed.  Given that the Minister has asked I suggest the committee do that.</P>

When it comes to the use of banned chemicals and violation of labour standards in a company it is strange that the employment rights compliance Bill does not, as yet, seem to have a date for publication.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a date as to when the employment rights compliance Bill will be published.  The heads of the Bill have not been brought forward so I do not have a date.</P>

	<P>Everybody knows that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Government abandoned the intellectual property legislation?  I remember I was likened to a good German doctor for quoting statistics from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Now the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is turning 12,500 Garda into 14,000 and the Minister for Finance is turning 650,000 people paying tax at 42% into 400,000.</P>

	<P>I was looking at the correspondence.  It was good of Deputy Bruton to word the question in a way that makes everybody look at the answer.  It was interesting to find out, when one examines it, that only 20% of people pay the higher rate of tax.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a very creative and technical argument that the Taoiseach could not master.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not have the time to do it.  It was very kind of the Deputy to frame his question in a way that actually made people look <Col N="1761"/>at the answer.  Now we know that only 20% of the people pay tax at the higher rate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  While the Bill is relatively short, it performs the important task of amending the functions of Comhairle, which <Col N="1769"/>will now be actively involved in helping people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>During the past few years, this Government has worked hard to improve the range of services and supports available to those who suffer from physical and intellectual disabilities.  That is only right and proper because the disability sector has for too long been forgotten in Irish society.  In the past, it was often the case that lip-service was paid to the provision of disability services but no real supports, whether in terms of money or personnel, were provided.  For all of us who worked in health care, the lack of supports in the disability sector was an indictment of health and social welfare services.  Such simple matters as the provision of disabled access to public buildings, not to mention the necessity of providing medical and social services, were simply overlooked.  Thankfully, with the recent passage of the Disability Act 2005 and the commitment of the Government to the sectoral plans, disability is now centre stage.  That is where it must remain.</P>
        <P>As anybody who has had occasion to come in contact with people who suffer from disability will be aware, the strength of will and remarkable personal courage of disability sufferers have to be admired and respected.  A society can be judged in many ways but most important is the way in which it treats its most unfortunate members.  Misfortune can be a matter of financial hardship or it can arise from physical or intellectual disabilities.  Life is not easy for a person with a disability.  He or she has to fight constantly from the moment the disability appears, be that at birth or later in life.  The society to which we all aspire must go out of its way to address the inequalities and injustices which are often the lot of disability sufferers.</P>
        <P>Over the past several years, substantial strides have been made towards setting the balance in favour of disability.  The additional funds made available by the Minister of Finance, Deputy Cowen, in recent budgets are testimony to his personal commitment to easing the burden borne by disability sufferers.  That commitment was apparent during his time as Minister for Health and Children, when his interest in disability was greatly appreciated by all those involved in the sector.  That is why I warmly welcome this Bill.  A key issue for which the Bill provides is the establishment of an advocacy service for people with disability.  This new service represents a huge step forward for this most vulnerable group in society.  In effect it means that each person with a disability can have a personal advocate assigned to him or her so that he or she can be assisted in overcoming barriers to full participation in society.  In addition a person will be appointed as director of the personal advocacy service and will have responsibility for the overall management and control of the service.</P><Col N="1770"/>
        <P>I also welcome the arrangements for an independent appeals process that will come into play allowing the personal advocate of an applicant, who is dissatisfied with a decision regarding his or her eligibility for any service, to become actively involved on behalf of the applicant.  The role of the personal advocate is clearly set out in section 5, pages 6 to 12.  In essence the role is to act on behalf of the disabled person so that he or she can more easily access any services to which he or she is entitled.</P>
        <P>I particularly note section 5.7D(2), which enables a personal advocate in pursuance of his or her functions on behalf of the disabled person to enter any place where day care, residential care or training is provided for the person and to make inquiries on behalf of the person as is deemed appropriate by the advocate.  In this way the personal advocate will be more fully informed about the person he or she is representing and will by extension be more able to represent that person in pursuance of a social service.  While disabled people have become much more aware of their rights and entitlements, because of their disablement they are not always able to represent themselves fully when seeking services to which they are entitled.  It will be the role of the personal advocate to represent the disabled person when seeking what is justly his or hers under social services.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Title, which is clear and unambiguous.  Changing the name of Comhairle to Citizens Information will make what is being offered much more obvious to all &mdash; namely information on all social services.  We will now have the delivery of an integrated and seamless supply of high quality and independent information to the entire population and in particular to those who are most vulnerable and in need of support.  The provision of information on the social services available can only improve the lives of all our citizens.  From Department of Social and Family Affairs figures I understand that more than 1.5 million men, women and children benefited directly or indirectly each week from payments by the Department.  This figure is staggering and makes it understandable why information should be readily available on any queries on the provision of social services by members of the public.</P>
        <P>There are many other issues, such as housing, education, consumer rights, health services and employment, where members of the public have questions and need clear and unambiguous answers.  The passage of the Bill will enable the citizens information board to deliver this much-needed information.  I welcome the Bill, which will support citizens with disability to access their rights under the social welfare code more readily.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this Bill, which is a valuable <Col N="1771"/>incremental contribution to the making information available to citizens about their rights and entitlements.  I wish to get one matter off my chest before I start, about which the Minister will know.  Deputy Devins talked about the Title.  While I have no difficulty with the English version, Citizens Information Bill, I am baffled by the Irish Title, An Bille um Fhaisn&eacute;is do Shaor&aacute;naigh 2006.  To me faisn&eacute;is is about forecasting, for example faisn&eacute;is na haimsire.  Surely the Minister could consider simplifying the Title and inserting eolas instead.  We sometimes crucify the Irish language when we try to shoehorn Irish versions to comply with the requirements of a particular dictionary, whose name I shall not mention to which we all resorted in our time in order to do so.  While the Minister is bamboozled by that proposal I will mention other matters.</P>
        <P>I welcome the great advances in making information available to citizens over the years.  I recall people like the late Tom&aacute;s Rosengrave from Muintir na T&iacute;re, and the organisation itself many years ago pioneering making information available.  My first engagement with citizens&rsquo; information was as quite a young teenager when the local Muintir na T&iacute;re facilitated farmers in completing applications for various grants.  In those days the forms were quite obscure.  We have developed considerably.</P>
        <P>I have a concern and I do not know whether it is a case of me being sentimental or being an old fuddy-duddy.  Huge progress was made by volunteers in providing community information.  They did so to contribute to their community.  I know at times the extent of the information was inadequate.  At a time when I was not involved in politics my local Finglas Council for Social Services used to provide three times a week information on a range of services to people in the area.  The information was about rents to the council, the cost of cable television or social welfare entitlements in the days when people from Finglas were required to go into Gardiner Street to sign on as Finglas did not have an office.</P>
        <P>We need to try to get the balance right between the numbers of people who provide service on a voluntary basis and the increasing rush to employ professionals.  Some services can only be provided by professionals, which is why I am not that critical of the Bill.  In the area of disability we need adequately trained and very skilled advocates to help people with disabilities to develop their individual care plan requirements.  However, the country is the poorer for our increasing reliance on the delivery of services by paid full-time professionals all the time, in well-staffed and well equipped offices.  I pay tribute to the quality of the accommodation now available to Comhairle and MABS, and the way people are received in social welfare offices, which is considerably better than it used to be.</P><Col N="1772"/>
        <P>However, times have changed.  I am well aware that 700,000 queries were processed by citizen information centres in 2000, which is a reflection on people who draft and design forms.  The application for refund of nursing home charges is very complicated.  When I first saw it, I thought I should refer the person, who brought it to me, to a solicitor.  Do forms really need to be so complicated?  Medical card forms have become very complicated.  I raised this matter at another forum and while I have the floor I will outline my gripe again.  I cannot understand why long-term medical card holders need to be assessed annually when it is patently obvious that their circumstances have not changed.  If anything, their medical condition has deteriorated.  Why is a great deal of money being spent on overtime for HSE officials to trawl through eligibility levels and people&rsquo;s income circumstances when a quick cross-reference would suffice in establishing a person&rsquo;s entitlement?  That is something that must be examined.</P>
        <P>The fact that 34% of queries received were about social welfare issues, 15% concerned employment queries and 13% concerned health service payments raises questions.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is pioneering in much of what it does in providing information but many people appear to be afraid to approach social welfare officials.  They need not be fearful but there is still some reluctance in that regard.  I do not know what the Minister and his Department can do to make the offices of his Department more customer friendly.  In many cases there is no longer a hatch.  Perhaps they could become more like modern walk-in banks, for example, where one can sit down in a reasonably private area and have one&rsquo;s circumstances discussed.  That might be tried on a pilot basis, if it is not being done already.  Many of the people who come to us, and we are nearly the port of last resort in many cases, have not had a positive experience with somebody linked with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It may be the case that somebody has not been willing to provide full information to an assessment inspector who has called but it is an area that could usefully be examined.</P>
        <P>I referred briefly to the development of the advocacy service, which is important.  However, we should make haste slowly.  Talking to an advocate in the employment area today I wondered if sometimes they conjure up problems to compile a stronger case to present so that they do not appear to be redundant.  They must have very good facilitation and listening skills.  They need to empathise with people but that does not mean they should not ask the difficult questions.  However, some sensitivity must be borne in mind when delivering a high quality, customer focused, integrated information service.</P><Col N="1773"/>
        <P>I urge Comhairle to proceed more slowly than some other organisations in advertising their services.  There is little point in providing an e-mail address for people who want to contact that organisation when half the people in the country are not computer literate and much of the other half does not have access to a computer, except through a public library, to get this type of information.  There is a great deal to be said for simple, old-fashioned, clearly written and clearly understood information that people can access.  That was the case in the past when one could leaf through a handbook and find out one&rsquo;s entitlements, the requirements and so on.  We should not always have to depend on the electronic form of processing the information.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, additional funding for the development and facilitating of the advocacy service will be necessary.  I commend the fact that each year the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and his predecessors, were able to give additional funding to Comhairle and to the money advice and budgeting service.  The people in MABS do a great job and I have great time for them.  I have seen the way they were able to steady people who were lurching towards greater indebtedness.  The link with the local organisations including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the local credit union, officials from the Minister&rsquo;s Department and officials from local authorities has made a major difference.  I do not want to mention any names but there are a number of people in the Finglas and Ballymun MABS offices that I have seen over the years blaze a trail in the area of advocacy and provide clear information.</P>
        <P>Much good work is being done by MABS in dealing with the recipients of awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  A number of cases spring to mind where, were it not for the intervention of MABS, the money would have been frittered away unwisely.  The people in MABS were able to advise those people, most of whom never had a bank account.  They might have had a post office account but they were not involved in savings schemes and so on.</P>

	<P>Deputy McGrath will be aware of people like that also from his teaching experience.  I commend the work of MABS and I hope the Minister can find ways of continuing to support its expansion.  We are not talking about making people dependent.  I have discovered that the opposite is the case.  MABS people are very good listeners and organisers but they are also very good at explaining to people that if they buy a flat screen television, they will land themselves deeper into debt.  They tell it as it is and that is as it should be but for that they need a great deal of training.</P><Col N="1774"/>
        <P>It is important that all of us are able to advise the public of the importance of this new service.  To make it available and understandable, I suggest that the Minister and his officials produce a leaflet outlining what is available under this service and make it widely available through constituency offices, citizens information offices, public libraries and so on.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>We are all conscious that this Bill must be put through the House as quickly as possible.  It has been delayed long enough.  There are people depending on it and waiting for it to come into force.  Not everyone will benefit from it but what is new?</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Bill 2006 replaces the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004.  The Citizens Information Bill, like the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill it replaces, provides primarily for the introduction of a personal advocacy service for people with disability.  The introduction of a personal advocacy service is a key element in improving services for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>People with a disability face barriers that are often impossible to surmount without help and too often those barriers are erected by people in institutions whose principal disability is selfishness.  It is easier to blame the person with a disability rather than take down the barrier, blame the size of the wheelchair rather than the narrowness of the aisle and blame the person rather than remove the obstacle.</P>
        <P>In truth, it is people with disabilities who have forced us to change our perception.  I continually hear people talk about how we have changed our approach to people with disabilities.  We would have the same approach and would treat them the very same way if they did not come out and insist we change our view of them and their view of the world.  That is important.</P>
        <P>The time has passed when people with disabilities could be forced to be content with whatever label we chose to pin on them, whatever pigeonhole we chose to slot them into and whatever method of charity we chose to employ to help them eke out a limited and constrained life.</P>
        <P>For years, people with disabilities have rejected what is known as the medical model but this Government has once again reverted to it in the Disability Bill.  The medical model of disability is the description that says all the disadvantages that go hand in hand with disability are caused by the disability itself.  People with disabilities have been demanding instead that we accept a social model that describes disability much more according to the barriers that confront them.  When one talks about this, everyone agrees, yet the medical model continues to feature in the legislation.  Increasingly people with disabilities have been demanding one simple right, that is, <Col N="1775"/>the right to be treated as equal citizens in a republic.  This is not a lot to ask for in a republic.</P>
        <P>There are concerns over the proposed Comhairle (Amendment) Bill, published in September 2004.  These relate to ensuring the most vulnerable people with disabilities can be automatically referred to a personal advocacy service without them or their families having to initiate such contact themselves; ensuring the personal advocacy service can address quality and safety issues for individuals in respect of services currently provided; expanding the application of the service to cover those who are already availing of services &mdash; for instance, it might be in the best interest of an individual to have an alternative service; and ensuring the qualifications of the personal advocate are specified in the Bill.  The Minister is stating such qualifications will eventually be described, which is to be welcomed.  However, when will this happen?  The provision of advocacy services for individuals is very important and it is therefore important that the Title of the Bill include the word &ldquo;advocacy&rdquo;.  Why does it not?  After all, the Bill addresses the issue of advocacy.</P>
        <P>Some of these issues are addressed in the Citizens Information Bill 2006 but there are still concerns surrounding a number of elements.  Advocacy, as a profession, is just developing in this country and as it develops new needs and best practices will emerge.  It would therefore be sensible to provide for a review process that could commence after a reasonable period.  It would usually be commenced after three to five years.</P>
        <P>There needs to be a broad definition of the qualifications required to be a personal advocate.  While such a definition is not contained in the Bill, I welcome the fact the Minister will consider it for inclusion on a future date.  In this regard we also need more details regarding the number of advocates that will be appointed.  Where will they be based and how many will there be?  People with disabilities not only live in Dublin but also in all sorts of small places throughout the country.  I accept fully that there cannot be an advocate &ldquo;for everyone in the audience&rdquo;.  This would not be necessary but advocates need to be available when required.</P>
        <P>We must also receive assurances on the independence of the advocacy service.  A very thin line exists between the service provider and client, especially where the needs of those with disabilities are concerned.  Considering that service provision has heretofore been carried out by charitable institutions, the line is even more blurred in the case of people with disabilities.  It is very important that there be a gap between the service provider and the client.  If I have a problem with a service, I need to know the person pursuing my case on my behalf is not linked to the provider.  There should be daylight between the two.</P><Col N="1776"/>
        <P>The development of advocacy services in this country is in its early stages and we need to be very careful it does not occur such that no standards apply.  Standards are a major issue in the provision of services for people with disabilities.  We have clearly not yet reached a sufficient standard, which always astonishes me.  Given the State is the financial provider, I cannot understand why we do not demand service and standards.</P>
        <P>A disproportionate number of people with disabilities in Ireland live in institutions as compared to those in other countries.  It is important that these individuals be attended to.  We need to ensure they do not have to be proactive in seeking a service and that they are attended to first.  Let us determine how they feel about their living conditions.  They may be extremely happy to live in institutions but, if not, we should know about it.</P>
        <P>The power of personal advocates must be extended to all residential institutions.  Section 5 states that, in order to qualify for a personal advocate, the person must prove he or she would come to some harm if he or she did not receive the service.  Surely one should get the service if one needs it and can benefit from it, rather than the other way around.  This should be the criterion above all others.</P>
        <P>Deputy Carey referred to the fact that one must make an application for service in writing.  If one is capable of stating in writing why one needs the service and why one would come to harm if one did not receive it, why would one need an advocate?  In such circumstances, one is clearly capable of arguing one&rsquo;s own case.  This provision is such that the service will not be as helpful as it could be.  Any service of this kind should reach out rather than wait passively to be accessed.  It should be very proactive.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides that where a person with a disability is dissatisfied with a decision on his eligibility for the personal advocacy service, he will be able to avail of the services of the appeals office of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to determine his appeal.  The legislation outlines the procedures to be in put in place in this regard.  The Minister knows I deal frequently with the appeals section of his Department.  I cannot praise it highly enough.  It is incredible and independent and it takes its independence very seriously.  I am glad it is involved with this Bill because I know that, on receiving cases, it will adjudicate in a very fair and practical manner.  The difficulty I have is that there is now a backlog.  Will more staff be employed if appeals cases arise?  Such cases will probably be a little more difficult than the standard social welfare cases.  Will more resources be put in place to ensure the backlog is reduced and that further difficulties will not be created for the section and <Col N="1777"/>the Department as a whole when the additional responsibility is taken on?</P>
        <P>I was supposed to speak on this Bill last week but did not get an opportunity to do so because its progress through the House has been patchy.  However, on hearing the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech at the weekend, in which I was most interested, I was very glad I did not speak on the legislation last week, although I believe it should be dealt with as quickly as possible.  The Taoiseach did not say much and made exactly the same promises he made in 2002, namely, to recruit more garda&iacute;, solve the accident and emergency crisis etc.  Given he did not deliver on those promises then, why should we believe him now?  The one key point he made was on the rights of children.  I find this interesting because during the debate on the Disability Bill, which is now the Disability Act 2005, Deputy Stanton and I pleaded not only with the Minister responsible, but also with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business to give rights to people with disabilities.  The amazing thing is that many children have disabilities.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I was present when the Irish Human Rights Commission addressed the joint committee, which is chaired by Deputy Ardagh.  When I asked why people with disabilities do not have the same rights as me, Deputy Stanton or the Minister, Deputy Brennan, I was told that such people are not considered to be equal citizens.  Will the Taoiseach have the same concern for children with disabilities as he has for able-bodied children?  Will they be catered for in the new referendum on the rights of children?  I do not just refer to this Government when I say we are all guilty.  Will children with disabilities be considered separately?  Why was the Government unable to give rights to such children in the Disability Act 2005?  It has suddenly decided, as we approach a general election, that it wants to protect the rights of all children.  I am sure people with disabilities will not hold their breath in that regard.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments at the weekend were hypocritical when one considers he was unable to help the most vulnerable people in society, who genuinely needed such assistance.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the personal advocacy service is welcome, but I am not sure how effective the service will be if the foundation of the edifice is not based on rights.  This Bill will not oblige the Government to create any additional positions in the areas of speech therapy, occupational therapy or psychology.  There will not be any extra needs assistants, care workers, teachers, doctors or nurses as a result of it.  Those who access the service will immediately be affected by issues of practicability and affordability.  There may be a gap between what they need and what the State is willing to give them.  They need rights, but the State is not prepared to offer them those rights.</P><Col N="1778"/>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to use this occasion to remind the Government parties of their commitment in this regard in the 2002 programme for Government.  I could refer to commitments in areas like Garda resources and accident and emergency services, but we are talking about the Citizens Information Bill 2006.  The Government promised in 2002 to introduce legislation based on a commitment to rights for a group of Irish citizens who have been receiving charity for most of their lives.  I remind the House of the commitment in the programme for Government to &ldquo;complete consultations on the Disabilities Bill&rdquo; and &ldquo;bring the amended Bill through the Oireachtas and include provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement&rdquo;.  That is another example of the use of the word &ldquo;rights&rdquo;.  In 2002, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, knew that people in the disability community were insisting on rights-based legislation.  They did not get it, however, and we have returned to this old issue in 2006.  The Government has promised to provide for rights, but I do not believe it.  The commitment that was made in 2002 was not honoured, unfortunately.  The legislation that was put in place did not aim to provide rights or end inequality.  It perpetuates a culture of dependence and charity, in the midst of our great prosperity.</P>
        <P>There is a substantial level of demand for the services of Comhairle and other information providers.  In 2005, there were 2.5 million individual users of the Oasis website, 88,000 people called the citizens information telephone services and 734,000 queries were made to the citizens information services.  We need to offer a state-of-the-art service that allows people to access information about their rights and entitlements.  I have been concerned for some time about the fact, as outlined in responses to parliamentary questions, that 60,000 families are entitled to the family income supplement, but just 18,500 of them are receiving it.  Some &euro;100 million is not being claimed.  I received a very good response to a comprehensive leaflet drop about this matter that I did in my constituency.  If able-bodied working people in the community are in daily contact with all sorts of services, but do not know they are entitled to claim money from the State, how are people with disabilities supposed to access services?  While some people with disabilities are helped by the organisations which operate on their behalf, many of them are isolated.  This Bill should ensure the advocates of people with disabilities go out and speak to them, rather than sit in an office and wait for people with disabilities to come to them.</P>
        <P>While this is a good and worthwhile Bill, the main thrust of it is wrong.  The service being established cannot be passive &mdash; it must be proactive and easily accessed.  No further barriers should be put in the way of people with disabilities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Citizens Information Bill 2006.  Essentially, the purpose of the legislation is to provide for the establishment of a personal advocacy service, especially for people with disabilities.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on his good and inspired decision some time ago to appoint Mr. Chris Glennon as the chairman of Comhairle.  It is good to offer such positions to people who have been active in the fields of journalism, current affairs and developments over many years.  Such people can have a great deal of experience of what is good, what works and what does not work.  It is suitable to choose people like that to fill jobs of this nature.  I am reminded that Mr. Michael Mills, who was the first Ombudsman, was a former political journalist.  He brought great dignity and courage to that office.  That position is now held by Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, who is also a former journalist.  It seems a trend is developing in the approach of Governments to such positions over the years.  The people who have worked in such roles have distinguished themselves.  They may have been nice or severe to the Governments of the day on various occasions.  Journalists who have experienced the rough and tumble of various jobs tend to be somewhat fearless when they are chairing boards, as Mr. Glennon is doing in the case of Comhairle.  They are aware of the old dictum &ldquo;publish and be damned&rdquo;.  I am sure Mr. Glennon will act in a fearless manner on behalf of the people whose rights he is trying to improve.</P>
        <P>The services of Comhairle are provided at 235 centres throughout the country.  This legislation provides for the establishment of the position of director of personal advocacy services.  People can use a number of existing information channels to get information from Comhairle.  This Bill will bring the various channels together into a single service.  In 2005, the Oasis website reached almost 2.5 million people, which is a large number.  While 2.5 million different contacts were made, some people may have contacted the site on multiple occasions.  Nevertheless, it is an important site.  I use it intermittently since I became aware of it recently.  The citizens information service, which dealt with 734,000 queries in 2005, provides face-to-face services at 235 locations, in permanent offices as well as in outreach offices where it may be available one morning a week, for example.  It is great that such an outreach facility is available.  The citizens information telephone service dealt with 88,000 queries last year.  I do not know how many times I have heard the advertisement for that service, but I cannot remember the relevant telephone number.  I know that a great effort is made in the advertisement to help people to remember the number.  The services in question are competing with other channels which are providing information.  The entire process will be easier and more user-friendly for the general public when all three services are brought together under the <Col N="1780"/>single and easily identifiable title of the citizens information service.</P>
        <P>When I have encountered the service provided by the citizens information service at local level, I have been impressed by how up-to-date is the information given by its staff.</P>
        <P>They travel with their laptops and have software, which will be the envy of every Deputy.  People meet with the representative who can key in the particulars and give good quality direction immediately.  This is to be welcomed.  I recently came across a firm offering a similar facility to Deputies for use in clinics.  While there is space for such a service, I do not know how many Deputies have taken up the offer.  The nature of our work is such that it is often difficult to provide information on the spot.</P>
        <P>While I am a fan of citizens information services, I know that historically other Deputies were not.  My first contact with citizens information services came when I was selected as a D&aacute;il candidate in 1997.  I had not been involved in local government and did not have much experience of making representations on behalf of people.  I called into my local office in Portlaoise where the staff provided me with the information and assistance I required.  I was trying to increase my well of knowledge and found that office to be an outstanding facility.</P>
        <P>However, I recall reading speeches at the time from Deputies who were giving out about citizens information centres.  They felt it would put an end to the function of a local representative and his clinics and that the centres were subverting the work Deputies were doing.  I certainly hope this attitude is dead and buried.  There are probably a few Deputies who would like people to be dependent on them and not be in a position to get the information on their own.  I believe that people should have access to all the information to which they are entitled.  They should not have to depend on meeting a Deputy in a clinic.</P>
        <P>After I was elected to this House, I had a good working relationship with the citizens information centres in Portlaoise and throughout County Laois.  Occasionally, the staff would come across anomalies which they would informally bring to my attention so that we could raise it with the policy unit in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There is a good exchange of information between the centres and elected representatives.</P>
        <P>I had a number of clinics around the county that I would hold on Fridays or Saturdays.  After a couple of years, I noticed that the citizens information service was going to almost all my venues on other days.  They had obviously seen where my clinics were held and I felt that imitation was the best form of flattery.  They felt that I had sussed out the outlying towns and villages where people needed assistance.  It was good that the public should have such a choice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I do not know how well the service is briefed on housing issues.  I am not referring <Col N="1781"/>to housing for people with disabilities or disabled persons grants.  Sometimes one has to advocate on behalf of constituents with the relevant local authority.  While the brief of the service has been to provide information, I do not think it has been able to advocate with housing departments on their clients&rsquo; behalf.  Sometimes constituents will be referred to me by the citizens information centres.  I am sure they give the names of other Deputies as well; there is no question of them operating on a partial basis for one Deputy only.  It impresses me that they knew the limits of their powers but could refer their clients to someone who could help further.</P>
        <P>Similar circumstances arise with social welfare queries.  I do not know if the service has the authority to contact the Department of Social and Family Affairs on behalf of a client.  It is normally up to the client to contact the Department directly.  As elected representatives, we are fortunate that we can do this on behalf of constituents.  If this facility is not open to the service, perhaps it could be further examined, subject to it being used judiciously.  A dedicated information line could be set up for citizens information services so that they can determine to what office certain files have been dispatched and who is the deciding officer.</P>
        <P>Deputies today received an extensive booklet from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, on the various social welfare schemes.  It contains a wealth of information and it is only when one sees the extent of the schemes that one realises the need for citizens information services.  I do not think any Deputy could be fully conversant with all the details of social welfare schemes.  Booklets could also be issued for farming and other sectors of society.  There is much information to be assembled, and the service does a good job in helping collate it.  It has excellent software that helps staff in the course of their work.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the Title of the legislation, namely, the Citizens Information Bill 2006.  A Deputy queried the cumbersome Irish language version of it.  While I am not an expert on the language, I accept the point that has been made.  Another Deputy asked that the advocacy nature of the service be reflected in the Title.  That may or may not be a valid point.  My main issue with the Title is that members of the international community living among us who are not Irish citizens may feel that this is not for them.  I feel it is a genuine mistake and an amendment must be made to the Long and Short Titles of the Bill.  This legislation gives the impression that this information is only available to citizens.</P>
        <P>Ireland has long passed the time when only Irish citizens lived here.  People from the EU or elsewhere who would rely on these services could be forgiven for thinking that it was not for them.  There is only one appropriate response open to the Minister and that is to take this point on board.  This problem struck me when I first stud<Col N="1782"/>ied the Bill and while other Deputies had views on the Title, I felt this was the most basic problem with it.  I hope it can be examined in due course.</P>
        <P>Section 2 provides a good definition of the social services that can be provided by a statutory body or voluntary organisation.  I wish to make a general point that is not specific to this Bill.  I consider almost every Bill that comes before the House to be badly drafted.  Definitions should be contained in the first few sections.  This Bill has definitions in sections 5, 7, 7A and elsewhere.  The dispersal of these definitions makes legislation cumbersome.  Perhaps it is because of old habits in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel where they tend to define a particular aspect of the legislation only when they come to it.  All the definitions should be outlined at the beginning.  I do not think the Minister will change it in this Bill because it would require significant redrafting.  However, I suggest that it be done in future.  The Acts are referred to in this legislation, whose purpose is to amend the Comhairle Act 2000 and replace the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004.  It also refers to the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  At least four Acts or Bills are referred to in this legislation.  We should opt for immediate consolidating legislation to bring it all together.</P>
        <P>We are creating administrative work for the citizens&rsquo; information centres and all those involved if they need four Bills or Acts at their fingertips to discover what a given section lays down.  Legislation should be simple, and if it is a matter of providing information, it should all be in consolidated legislation rather than in four or five different Acts.  Providing information is not easy when one has all that, and perhaps the Minister might address it.  In the Department of Social and Family Affairs, there is an excellent practice of regularly producing consolidating legislation.  Although this is a short Bill, there is a need for consolidation somewhere down the road.  That should not be too complicated, since no issues of principle or policy are involved; it is merely a matter of tidying it up and facilitating people to use the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has always intrigued me.  I am pleased to say as a Deputy that I have referred several cases to it and that my attendances at oral hearings have been successful.  I do not have the figures to hand, but the success rate in the appeals office is 40% or 50%.  The real question relates to how so many wrong decisions were made by deciding officers in the first place.  I would have hoped that they might have got many more of those decisions right initially.  What does that say about the original decisions and the deciding officers?  What have they done to those members of the public who came for their disability allowance, were turned down after three months&rsquo; delay, dealt with the appeals office for months on end, perhaps going in and out to the community welfare officer, only <Col N="1783"/>to find that they had been entitled to a payment from day one?  There should be some internal mechanism regarding how decisions are being overturned.   We assume that the final decision is correct; we certainly hope so.</P>
        <P>I know the answer to some of that.  Officers are too lazy to write for information such as a copy of a bank statement and it is easier to get the file off their desks and refuse the allowance on the basis of insufficient information provided.  However, the appeals officer or someone else at that level has to do the work to get to the bottom of the case.  There is too much trying to get rid of a case and closing it off, even if it means refusal.</P>
        <P>For that reason, one of the few reports that I read every year is the case studies of the appeals office.  I have gone back through some cases that mirrored those initially refused by deciding officers.  Given what the appeals office has said regarding the case studies that it prints in its annual report, I have now taken cases back to the appeals office.  I may achieve satisfaction on behalf of the clients.  There must be a lack of quality control if so many decisions are being overturned.  I know that it is not specific to this legislation, but it is very relevant to the general topic being discussed.  I also know that the Minister likes changing the names of schemes, but people still refer to the children&rsquo;s allowance.  We can change them all we like, but old habits die hard.  People like familiarity, since it is part of human nature.</P>
        <P>I agree with the idea voiced a few moments ago that family income supplement payments are routinely under-claimed.  There is a substantial need.  The Department should be helped through its own devices, and those with an income below a certain level should be known from the tax office.  Some of them do not even reach the threshold for the 20% tax rate.  It would not hurt to send them all a leaflet stating that they should check their entitlements.  One would know by definition if they were on low incomes.  Perhaps not all work long enough hours to qualify for family income supplement, FIS, but many will.  When we pass legislation, there is an onus on the Government to help citizens make claims.  Mechanisms might involve links with the Revenue Commissioners if the social welfare staff lacks details of all those on relatively low incomes; it is possible to get them.</P>
        <P>In this evening&rsquo;s debate and previously, the rights of children in a referendum were mentioned.  It goes without saying that we support that.  One may agree or disagree with the need for a referendum, but all fair-minded people will be happy that the principle of children&rsquo;s rights will be enshrined in our Constitution in due course once there has been a proper, full and public debate.  I heard Deputies from the Labour Party say last night that there was no need for such a debate, since the issue was closed.  However, the debate has hardly started, and we need an informed discussion.</P><Col N="1784"/>
        <P>The term &ldquo;dependent relative&rdquo; is demeaning and belittling and it tends to be directed towards women.  I hate this phrase.  I would like to see that changed under the social welfare heading if the Minister has not already changed it in his recent alterations to titles.   When men receive the old-age pension, their wives are normally described as receiving the dependent relatives&rsquo; allowance, which is not the full amount.  They are demeaned in two ways.</P>
        <P>The concept of dependency must be re-examined.  People come to me about it, and not only the title is wrong, since in this day and age, they believe that spouses are entitled to an equal old-age pension payment.  I know that there have been tremendous improvements in raising dependent relatives&rsquo; payments closer to the full amount for a single person, and I urge that in the next budget the Minister identify the funding necessary to equalise it.  The people in question are the mothers who raised us all.  They see younger women enjoying chances outside the home that they did not have, and they now feel entitled to some of the benefits and recognition.  I ask that the Minister take that into account as part of the current budget and social welfare legislation.  It would very much be appreciated by all dependent relatives, the majority of whom happen to be women.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a fh&aacute;il labhairt ar an mBille seo, ar a dtugtar anois the Citizens Information Bill 2006, an Bille um Fhaisn&eacute;is do Shaor&aacute;naigh 2006.  Is fada an b&oacute;thar nach bhfuil aon chasadh ann, agus seo sampla de Bhille a bhfuil a l&aacute;n athruithe d&eacute;anta air &oacute; cuireadh an s&iacute;ol.  T&aacute;imid anseo anois ag pl&eacute; Bille at&aacute; tar &eacute;is teacht i ndiaidh Bill&iacute; eile, na ceithre cinn at&aacute; luaite cheana f&eacute;in ar a laghad, the Comhairle Bill 2000, the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 to name but two.  It is also interesting to see, because the legislation is so interlinked with the needs of those with disabilities, that the Disability Federation of Ireland newsletter of August 2006 gave a very interesting overview of the federation&rsquo;s work and aspirations in that regard.  It stated that it had met senior officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to reach agreement on several key issues.</P>
        <P>I will not go through all those listed, but they include ensuring that the most vulnerable people with disabilities can automatically be referred to a personal advocacy service without their or their families&rsquo; having to initiate such contact themselves and ensuring that the personal advocacy service can address quality and safety issues for individuals in respect of services currently provided.  Also listed are expanding the application of the service to include those already in services, for example, where an individual&rsquo;s interests might be better served by alternative services and ensuring that the qualifications of personal advocates are specified in the Bill, and that its Title <Col N="1785"/>includes the word &ldquo;advocacy&rdquo;, as the substantive issue concerns the advocacy service.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P FLI="0">That is one disappointment to begin with because the Bill &mdash; unless the Minister intends to propose amendments &mdash; does not make provision in that regard.  I refer here to use of the titles &ldquo;Comhairle&rdquo;, &ldquo;the citizens advocacy services support agency&rdquo; or whatever.  Perhaps the Minister is using the tabloid version of the Title rather than its longer counterpart.  However, he must come to terms with the fact there was an understanding that the word &ldquo;advocacy&rdquo; would be included in the Title.  I will be interested in his reply in that regard.</P>
        <P>In June the Taoiseach indicated to the House that what has been published as the Citizens Information Bill 2006 is the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, plus a few minor amendments.  The Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 was, in turn, presented as being section 5 of the Disability Bill 2001, hived off as distinct legislation.  The most obvious of the Government&rsquo;s material amendments to what was proposed in 2004 is the proposal to rename, as the citizens information board, the State agency Comhairle, which was established as recently as June 2000.  The new agency is to be invested with responsibility to directly deliver to members of the public a personal advocacy service and to retain and further develop Comhairle&rsquo;s existing responsibility to fund and support the national network of independent non-statutory citizens information boards.</P>
        <P>If implemented, the Citizens Information Bill 2006 will create a national statutory agency called the citizens information board, with a network of 12 offices located in Dublin and throughout the country.  This board and these offices will explicitly not provide information and advice services to the public.  They will instead provide funding and support, including management level support, to the network of local independent non-statutory citizens information boards including &mdash; I am particularly proud of this &mdash; the award winning Fingal (North County) Citizens Information Service, which provides services in Balbriggan, Skerries, Swords and Malahide.  I know many of the people involved with the latter and am aware that they take their work seriously and do an excellent job.</P>
        <P>The issues that arise in respect of the Bill are causing public confusion by imposing an unnecessary and unwanted change of name on a recognised and successful public agency and writing off the considerable investment during the past six years in building up the national brand name of Comhairle.  One must recall that Aer Lingus previously spent many millions on tilting its shamrock.  I wonder whether making changes of this nature are considered good value for money, particularly when a brand is already in existence.  Perhaps most importantly, however, there is the issue of a State agency moving in and colonising the citizens information brand that has <Col N="1786"/>been built up by non-governmental efforts over a period of decades.</P>
        <P>Informing these matters is a profound and fundamental issue that goes to the heart of pluralism in our democracy.  Since the first community-based citizen information centres were opened, without any State support, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, they have derived their mandate from the communities they developed to serve, rather than from the apparatus of State.  The individual mandates of the different citizens information services throughout the country are plural, not singular.  They are citizens information services primarily because they are citizen initiated, citizen run, citizen directed and, in the main and largely through voluntary effort, citizen delivered.  They have been supported in recent years by professional management and structured, formal and broadly representative voluntary boards of management.</P>
        <P>The citizens information movement finally won a measure of State recognition, without financial support, in July 1975.  It has developed steadily in the three decades since on the back of sustained voluntary effort at local community level.  Citizens information services are practical and admirable examples of participative citizenship in action &mdash; self-help and assistance provided to people in their dealings with the sometimes bewildering requirements of the State in its multifaceted role as a facilitator and provider of social services.</P>
        <P>The Minister &mdash; I hope he takes this as a compliment because that is how it is meant &mdash; as one of the canniest and most experienced members of the Cabinet seems to have made a fundamental mistake in his approach to this legislation in that he appears to have interpreted the term &ldquo;citizens information&rdquo; as meaning citizen-directed information provision, rather than what it actually represents.  This misunderstanding appears to lie at the root of the misjudged initiative to bring into being a State agency that will be a creature of the Oireachtas, overseen by ministerial appointees, and called the citizens information board.</P>
        <P>The State, regardless of who is in government, has a close relationship with the public, including its citizens, but it is not that public.  The notice placed &mdash; this is an example, albeit it in another context, which serves to illustrate that to which I am referring &mdash; at the entrance to the memorial gardens in Inchicore read &ldquo;Closed to the public, State function in progress&rdquo;.  For many people who work for citizens information boards, that emphasises that there is a fundamental misunderstanding with regard to what we are trying to achieve.</P>
        <P>The bulk of inquiries encountered by the personnel of citizens information centres, CICs, the vast majority of whom work on a voluntary basis, refer to services provided by the State but which do not depend on citizenship.  Access to most publicly provided services depends generally on ordinary or habitual residence only.  The type of queries to which I refer relate to access to health <Col N="1787"/>services, housing, liability for income tax and PRSI, entitlements to social welfare payments and access to regulatory protection for consumers or employees.  These are the main areas of activity of the CICs and none of them are citizen specific.</P>
        <P>A matter of increasing concern to citizens information centres during the past decade has been the provision of services by the State in the areas of asylum seeking and immigration.  Again, these are citizen-provided, State-supported information advocacy, support and referral services available to people new to Ireland.  By definition, these are services provided to citizens of countries other than Ireland and to stateless persons.  The Minister&rsquo;s ill-considered citizens information board initiative runs the risk of making such services appear to have exclusively citizen access only.  In that context, what is being done is slightly sinister and potentially dangerous.  I do not perceive that the Minister is attempting to proceed in that way, although such an interpretation can be applied to what he is proposing.</P>
        <P>Another slightly sinister aspect of the Bill is that it is presented by a Minister who, as Government Chief Whip to the late Mr. Haughey &mdash; we all remember Mr. Haughey, God rest him &mdash; was involved in the disgraceful attempt in 1987 to dismantle the network of citizens information centres and the rudimentary structures that existed to support them at that time.  The Minister can explain the background to these events in due course but the account that has been reported indicates that what occurred in 1987 led to the defeat of the then Government on an Opposition motion, while volunteer personnel of the CICs picketed outside the Kildare Street gate on another cold November afternoon.</P>
        <P>This Bill was published in the absence of any specific consultation with the bodies that will be immediately affected by it, namely, the 40 independent local non-statutory citizen information boards that have, with support from the old National Social Services Board and later Comhairle, been in operation in the period since the first of them formally incorporated as a limited liability, for charitable purposes, non-profit company in 1995.  Did the Minister consult the existing citizens information boards or the national organisation that represents them?  Has the board of Comhairle approved the proposed name change to citizens information board, with all that it entails?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs appears to be proceeding to appropriate to the State the largely voluntary efforts of an established network of specifically non-governmental organisations to be effected through the utterly inappropriate renaming of an existing State agency as the citizens information board.  Rather than proceed any further with the Bill which is, in subtle and profound ways, challenging some of the most basic tenets of democracy, it would be <Col N="1788"/>more appropriate to refer the Bill to a committee of the Oireachtas which might then, on an all-party basis, take appropriate time to hear the views of those who have accumulated decades of experience in the management and delivery of these crucial services, which are supplied to citizens and non-citizens alike without prejudice or discrimination.</P>
        <P>It is remarkable that, as far as I have been able to ascertain, no director of Comhairle or of its predecessor organisations, the National Social Services Board and the National Social Service Council, has in the period since 1974 been invited to appear before a committee of the Oireachtas and neither has any chairperson or chief executive of a citizen information service, notwithstanding the direct front-line exposure such persons necessarily have to the cutting edge of social policy in its variety of expressions.  It is an appropriate time to make good that remarkable oversight by successive Oireachtas committee chairpersons and what better place to start than with a discussion on the merits and difficulties contained in the Citizen Information Bill 2006?  It is important the people who have given so much service, time and voluntary effort are included in whatever development takes place.  Nobody is saying we can stand still.  Nobody is saying we should not implement all the recommendations, for example, those supported by the Disability Federation of Ireland and others, in the legislation but it is important not to lose what was a precious and important part of the services provided to date.</P>

	<P>I also welcome an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it into the House.  It is badly needed.  We, as a society, really need to focus on the requirements of people with disabilities and we have done this, in particular, over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>We have moved people with disabilities centre stage.  This has been done largely because of the significant work of disabled people themselves.  They have made successful representations to us all in this House over the years and helped us recognise the need to give them equality and equal access to services that the rest of us enjoy.</P>
        <P>In recent years a considerable improvement has come about for people with a disability, through the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, and also with this Bill.</P>
        <P>It is definitely a policy objective of everybody of this House that there would be equal access to services for people with disabilities.  We want to improve the services to people with disabilities right across the board.  Comhairle, over the past number of years, has provided customer-friendly high quality independent information and advice throughout this country on social services to all members of the public.  I have experience of this, even in my home town of Castlebar where an excellent service is provided through the citizens information service across a range of areas such as health, social welfare, education, family sup<Col N="1790"/>port, housing, taxation, citizenship issues, employment and training, and information for asylum seekers and immigrants.  They also provide support for information providers, both voluntary and statutory.</P>
        <P>This Bill is a new welcome development.  While there are many voluntary organisations that have provided advocacy services for people with disabilities, it is important this would be provided through a State-funded service.</P>
        <P>I welcome the development that the Minister will be providing a personal advocate for certain people with disabilities who meet the qualifying criteria.  The qualifying criteria is a matter which obviously needs to be explored.  A person will be assessed on the basis of need, the benefit he or she will derive from the service and the risk to his or her health or well-being if this service were not to be provided.</P>
        <P>This Bill is an overhaul of the current service.  It is a modernisation of the service in light of the changing society.  It is important to recognise the significant number of immigrants, both from the new EU member states and from countries outside the EU, who are living in Ireland.  The change of name, under section 1, is a welcome development.  I note, even through the operation of the service in my home town, that many people, particularly from outside of the State, know exactly where to go when they want to get independent information.  In that regard, the change of name is helpful in making accessible and readily identifiable to everybody where State-funded information services can be obtained.</P>
        <P>This service is essential because it offers opportunities to all.  It breaks down barriers that exist currently for people with disabilities and it helps the most vulnerable people in society to improve their lives.  That must be acted on immediately.  A number of Members stated the Minister should take it slowly, wait a little longer and engage in more consultation.  The resources allocated to a service such as this will always be an issue but it is important to proceed with it immediately to provide equal access, which is badly needed by many people.</P>
        <P>The Comhairle website is an excellent facility.  Previous speakers have stated everybody has not embraced the electronic age.  Significant numbers of young people are more proficient with technology than older people in society and many of them access the service.  What is the breakdown of the age profile of people accessing the service throughout the State?  Deputy Carey stated 200,000 queries were received in 2000.  How many use the service?  How many hits has the website received?  I have used it many times in my role as a public representative and it is an important facility, which provides excellent information.</P>
        <P>Sections 1 and 2 cover definitions of the social services, which include health, social welfare, education, family support, housing, taxation and so on.  Section 3 provides for a name change from <Col N="1791"/>Comhairle to the citizens information board, which is welcome.  The notion of a personal advocate for a disabled person to enable him or her to access all services and who can speak out on his or her behalf is also welcome.  The Bill aims to improve the lot of people with disabilities by providing this service to qualifying people.</P>
        <P>Under section 4 the Minister sets out the functions of the board to support the provision of advocacy services and the introduction of a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities who meet the criteria of qualifying persons.  It also provides that the board should support and develop greater accessibility and public awareness of social services.  However, I do not like the provision, which also came in to play in the Disability Bill 2004, that the board must have regard to the financial resources available.  The Minister has provided &euro;2 million this year and an additional &euro;250,000 will be provided to get the service up and running when the Bill is passed.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s estimate of the take-up of the personal advocacy service?  What is best practice in this regard in other countries?  Such information would give us an indication as to whether the service being provided will be adequate.</P>
        <P>The qualifying criteria address people who are unable, without the assistance or support of a personal advocate, to access the service and where there are reasonable grounds for believing there is a risk to that person&rsquo;s health, welfare or safety if he or she is not provided with the service.  Unfortunately, the legislation provides that people will be prioritised on the basis of greatest need.  If it is determined that a person faces a risk to his or her health or welfare and he or she is, therefore, a qualifying person, and the board cannot provide the service he or she requires because of finite resources, it leaves us in a difficult situation.  Such people will be identified as being in need but nothing will be done for them.  The issue of resources is critical to the legislation.  Unless it is adequately resourced, the Minister has no business pretending to offer a service.  There is nothing worse than pretending to offer a service to people and, at the end of the day, not having the finance in place to provide it.</P>
        <P>For example, last year, home care packages were announced as one of the solutions to the accident and emergency department problem.  County Mayo has a population of 110,000 and five people received such a package.  How can a service be offered to everybody when only five people will receive it?  Failure to resource the service would be a significant backward step, in light of everything that has been done for people with disabilities.  We are moving forward and putting them centre stage by providing a badly needed service but the question is whether sufficient money will be in place to provide it.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the current requirement that all applications for a personal advocate must be made in writing but section 7B states, <Col N="1792"/>&ldquo;may apply in writing or such other form as may be specified by the Minister to the Director&rdquo;.  What are the other forms of application?  People with certain disabilities may not be able to make an application in writing.  However, I am sure the Minister, given that people with disabilities are centre stage, has foreseen that scenario and he has another recommendation in place to get around that.</P>
        <P>I also welcome section 5, which gives rights to a personal advocate to enter any place that provides day care, residential care or training for the qualifying person to represent his or her interests.  The Minister has provided for a penalty in section 7D of a summary conviction or a fine not exceeding &euro;2,000 where a person obstructs or hinders a personal advocate in the performance of his or her duties.  That is welcome because such clout is needed for a personal advocate to be successful and to truly benefit the disabled person.  A significant penalty is needed if advocates are obstructed in their work.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Section 5 contains the meat of the legislation.  The issue of qualifications has been raised by many Members.  A number of people engaged by the citizens information service work in a voluntary capacity beside many trained professionals.  The Bill provides that people other than staff of the information service can operate as personal advocates and, therefore, the issue of qualifications and skills is critical.  What training will be offered to aspiring personal advocates?  What qualifications will be necessary to take up that line of work?  Personal advocates will play a significant role in the lives of people with disabilities and great responsibility will be placed on them, as the Bill provides that they can access information on behalf of the person with a disability, enter any place in which he or she is receiving day care and attend meetings and consultations on his or her behalf.  It is clear that significant qualifications and appropriate listening and negotiating skills and so on will be required.  What is best practice in this regard in other states?  What qualifications are required to take up such a role in other countries?</P>
        <P>Generally, I welcome the legislation, which is urgently needed and should not be delayed.  However, the issue of resources is key to making it a success.  Everybody knows the Minister does not have an open chequebook and he must make decisions on and attach priorities to how money is spent.  Over the years, people with disabilities have been neglected and it is critical that does not happen under this legislation.</P>
       <P>Deputy Fleming referred to an issue regarding the adult dependant allowance, which I have raised repeatedly for a considerable time.  I welcome the changes made in this regard by the Minister on 29 September.  While the allowance has been increased, the Minister did not increase it to 100% of the spouse&rsquo;s payment, which is a commitment in the programme for Government. <Col N="1793"/> However, I read an interview with the Minister in <i>The Irish Times</i>, in which he stated he is committed to making the payment directly to all adult dependants.  He has done this for pensions but not for social welfare payments.  Approximately 95% of adult dependants are women.  Every woman in the State is entitled to an income of her own and she is entitled to have it paid directly to her.  The adult dependant is entitled to 100% of what her spouse is paid.  Hopefully, the Minister will address this in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We should begin by identifying the sequence of events regarding energy prices in the past year or so.  Political instability throughout the world, tempests, storms and hurricanes <Col N="1794"/>affected the availability of oil, gas and fuels in general, but any close observer of the industry would have noticed an abundance of those fuels on international markets in the past six months.  The knock-on effect was an obvious necessity for prices to reduce.  Despite the best efforts of those with vested and financial interests in the oil and gas industries, such as stockbrokers, financial services centres and oil companies, to talk up the prices of oil and gas during a long period, those prices reached a zenith and began to fall.</P>
        <P>At a time when the price was on a downward trajectory, there were sounds from the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is seeking price increases.  They were bound to do so if they could get the increases and I do not blame them for that.  The regulator, having duly considered the merits and factors of the Bord G&aacute;is case, decided to approve serious gas price increases of 34%.  However, gas was available for free on the London market that day.  The decision was extraordinary against such a backdrop.  Despite everyone&rsquo;s best efforts to talk up the price and declare a shortage, gas was free.  None the less, the price here was increased.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the ESB believes a price increase is merited, but this depends on what the Government has in mind for the ESB.  Does it want to fatten the ESB for sale like a number of other semi-State and State bodies and make consumers continue to pay through the nose?  A significant price increase has been awarded for 1 January 2007, which will be a major hit on consumers heavily overburdened with child care costs, commuting costs, mortgages, interest rate increases and so on.</P>
        <P>A number of events will take place between August 2006 and June 2007, hidden in the middle of which will be two considerable hits on consumers if this is allowed to continue.  I have spoken about what will affect domestic consumers, but the costs for industrial consumers will undergo a major hike.  Regarding the effects on manufacturing and service industries, my colleagues rather than I will go into the same level of detail as the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  I am amazed and appalled that the Minister allowed the regulatory system to take an action of this nature against consumers when they can ill afford it.  The increases will affect competitiveness.  Some 34,000 jobs have been relocated from our economy because of a lack of competitiveness.  If this is allowed to continue, we will lose more jobs.  The Government&rsquo;s much vaunted high-wage economy will be for naught, because our manufacturing jobs will be located elsewhere.  Where will the Government&rsquo;s accidental high-wage economy be then?</P>
        <P>I want to dismiss in its entirety the r&aacute;im&eacute;is of the Government&rsquo;s amendment to this motion because it chronicles the Government&rsquo;s failures in recent years, including its failure to develop and invest in proper alternative energy resources.  We recognise that 90% of our energy is imported. <Col N="1795"/> In the past five years, the Government should have invested money in research and development to ensure we put in place alternatives, become economically independent and provide from our own resources a major amount of the energy currently imported.  It would have made good, sound economic sense.</P>
        <P>The Minister has a number of choices, namely, he can tell the regulator that the increases are not currently sustainable and that he needs to know more about them or he can dismiss the regulator.  The regulatory system affecting consumers, industrial or domestic, is not working.  The Minister could declare there will be no more increases without his authority or he could abdicate his responsibilities and do nothing, the consequences of which would be colossal.  I say this in due deference to the Minister to give him a fair warning about the consequences.</P>
        <P>For some unknown reason, regulation in Ireland seems to drive up energy costs and make people compete at a higher level.  My colleagues will go into detail on our energy costs compared to other European countries.  The difference is significant and I leave it to the House to consider the matter.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Durkan for allowing me to share time to speak on this important motion, which signals a crippling issue for households and businesses.

	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn will get his chance.  He is there long enough.  The Minister is directly responsible for policy inactivity and an abdication of responsibility in respect of energy prices.  In recent years, we have seen considerable increases in the prices of gas and electricity, which is having an impact on employment costs and household budgets.</P>
        <P>Recently, I was in contact with a small firms association that carried out its annual business survey of costs.  Second only to labour costs, energy costs have been cited as one of the greatest issues in terms of employing people.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Major businesses have indicated to me that there has been a 77% increase in their energy bills in the past four years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is bound to have an impact on how and where one employs people and how one does business.  The National Competitiveness Council has reiterated this issue and confirmed the trend in its recent report on the cost of doing business in Ireland.</P>
        <P>We have seen the Government standing idly by as the Commission for Energy Regulation continued to heap on additional energy costs for the supposed purpose of introducing more competition to the sector.  Mr. Reeves, former assistant secretary at the Department of Public Enterprise and now one of the commissioners for energy regulation, stated on a number of occasions that he needs to increase energy costs to introduce more competition.  Competition is brought in to reduce prices, not to lead to the massive increases we have seen in the past couple of years.  Energy costs in Ireland are now, on average, 20% higher than for our EU neighbours.  Not taking into account the latest increases, there have been increases since 2003 of 50% in gas, 30% in electricity and 40% in diesel oil.</P>
        <P>There is a good reason for the Government to stand idly by in these matters because it is the biggest beneficiary of the increases in terms of Exchequer returns.  It has reaped significant benefit from VAT collected on foot of the increase in energy costs with an additional &euro;1 billion receipted in the past five years, while the excise rate on diesel oil is currently 48% higher than in 2001.</P>
        <P>This motion is to ask the Minister to act once and for all to get the Commission for Energy Regulation to see sense.  The Government must compel it to consider the price of oil and review its tariff structure accordingly, not just on an annual basis but more regularly, to deal with this type of situation instead of standing idly by, as it seems to be doing at the moment.  I predict that the recent increases granted for gas and electricity will contribute to arrears of ESB and gas bills this winter such as we have not seen for many years.  That is exactly what will arise from the decisions of the CER, whose remit and policy needs to change to allow for a much more regular review of these matters.</P>
        <P>The ESB is a very effective tax collector for the Government.  In the interest of saving our manufacturing base and ensuring we have a competitive economy, so that disposable household incomes are not eroded further on top of the recent mortgage rate increases, energy prices need an adequate structure and policies and the Minister must put in place the structural changes needed to make us competitive again.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1797"/>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unbelievable to be in the House debating this issue at a time when oil and gas prices are falling internationally.  We are debating proposed increases in electricity and gas prices which are making this country extremely uncompetitive in comparison to our European neighbours.  </P>
        <P>The reality for many households is that the rise in electricity prices alone will increase the bimonthly bill from ESB by 20%, or &euro;147, amounting to a total increase over a year of &euro;882.  As domestic customers reel under the increases that have taken place already under this Government there have been dramatic increases in the costs of living, in mortgage costs, commute times and child care costs, and now there is to be a further increase in energy costs.  As my colleagues have said, they are in the Government&rsquo;s interest because it is the biggest beneficiary of higher energy costs, owing to the VAT take, which from electricity and gas almost doubled between 2001 and 2005.  It is projected that this year the Government will take in a massive &euro;362 million on VAT alone, not including the large tax take on the profits from the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>People are struggling at the moment, especially the elderly, who cannot survive.  The same applies to manufacturing and the food industry.  It may come as a surprise to the Government but manufacturing and the food industry are the backbone of our indigenous economy.  They have been ignored in recent years because of the Government&rsquo;s policy but they will be the backbone of the economy in the future and it is critically important to support them.</P>
        <P>A recent survey of small indigenous companies carried out in County Roscommon by the county enterprise board shows that one third of those surveyed believed energy costs were the single biggest issue affecting their business, yet it is ignored by the Government.  As Deputy Durkan said, it is creating huge pressure.  Some 34,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost and something needs to be done.</P>
        <P>The regulators in this country, including the CER, are literally running roughshod over the domestic and industrial cost base and the ability of manufacturing businesses to operate and compete profitably is seriously undermined by rising energy costs, which are now by far the highest in Europe.  Irish companies must now pay an increase of 20% on their ESB bill, which puts huge pressure on their competitiveness.  It is critically important for the Minister to immediately issue a directive to the CER to ensure this increase does not go through.  In tandem with that, it is about time the Government reviewed its policy on the regulator.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation has deliberately increased prices in recent years, ostensibly to bring in competition, in which it has failed dismally.  What has the Minister done about it?  He has sat back, ignored it and passed the issue on to the CER.  Energy costs are decimating <Col N="1798"/>Irish industry and it is critically important the Minister takes ownership of the issue.  He must come out with a definitive energy policy for the future.  The Green Paper on Energy does not set out the direction that needs to be taken.  Fine Gael has proposed a comprehensive policy document on the biofuel industry but the only thing the Government has done for the biofuel industry is to put the kibosh on it by not allowing the sugar industry in Carlow and Mallow to develop it.  Instead the Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, has deliberately closed off that avenue when it should have opened it up.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Durkan for providing this opportunity to speak to a very important motion, namely, the urgent need to review the regulatory arrangements which have resulted in approval of huge price increases in gas and electricity at a time when international energy prices are falling.  </P>
        <P>I will raise a different but related issue.  How can the Government justify providing grant aid for the installation of storage heaters in the homes of the elderly and disabled yet allow the ESB to charge such individuals &euro;800 or more for connections?  The ESB claims it needs heavier wiring to install such heaters and the elderly must pay for it.  I attended the launch of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul annual review last week and its members spoke of how elderly people in particular had to deal with crippling ESB arrears.  Only yesterday I attended the annual general meeting of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society and one of the main issues raised at that conference was the cost of energy, which is causing serious problems for the entire food industry.</P>
        <P>Some people in this House are not very worried today about agriculture or the food industry.  They believe their best options are in the property market and the benefits that can accrue from it.  However, agriculture and the food industry are still extremely important.  The food industry is one of the few industries that can provide a base in rural Ireland and much needed employment.  Also, the raw material is available on the ground.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to explain to those involved in the food industry how the Government can allow the price of gas and electricity to increase so dramatically out of line with our nearest neighbours.  There is at least a 20% difference.  Many food companies have industries in the UK and other areas and know at first hand the significant difference in price and how this affects their competitiveness.  The fact that the price of oil has decreased on the international market makes it vital that the change we seek tonight is introduced immediately and the price here is re-examined.</P>
        <P>Last year I asked the Government to look specifically at the possibility of a change in its <Col N="1799"/>VAT take on electricity and gas as a small gesture towards industry and the private sector, but it ignored my suggestion and said it was impossible.  In the year 2005, the Government took in &euro;223 million compared to &euro;116 million in 2001.  It is clear that at the current rate of VAT, the Government will collect up to &euro;360 million this year, yet old age pensioners and those on disability payments cannot raise the necessary lump sum to fill their oil tanks.</P>
        <P>The Government failure to encourage alternative energy production is also part of the problem.  It has produced many papers on the issue, but many people interested in alternative energy have had to go to Scotland and other places to produce power abroad rather than here.  These are facts.  I have talked to those involved in the industry and know this is the case.</P>
        <P>The past ten years have seen major improvements in employment here, especially in the building industry, but many jobs have been lost in manufacturing.  Unfortunately, this trend has escalated due to the Government&rsquo;s failure to deal with the energy crisis.  It is vital that action is taken and that the regulator&rsquo;s proposal to increase electricity prices on 1 January 2007 is dealt with and that we ensure our prices are no dearer than our European counterparts.</P>
        <P>The current situation is untenable.  I urge the Minister to take whatever action he can on the issue.  He can do it through VAT or through the regulator.  He has many options.  He is in control and should show that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much talk by the Government about the strength of our economy, which has been buoyant over the past 12 years.  These 12 years of boom should have provided the opportunity to develop the two basic building blocks that would secure continued economic growth in the future, good infrastructure and an affordable and secure energy supply.</P>
        <P>We all know where we stand on the good infrastructure.  Delay after delay on meeting deadlines, with corresponding budget overruns, have left our transport system little better than that of a third world country.  People face hours on end stuck in traffic, a Luas system that does not connect and an outdated train system.  Also, we have totally abandoned the concept of carrying goods by rail.  So much for the first pillar needed to maintain our economic growth into the future.</P>
        <P>The second pillar of economic growth is a secure, affordable, environmentally friendly source of energy that could save our economy hundreds of millions of euro in carbon taxes.  We could have begun to solve this problem by taking a serious look at the beet industry, particularly that at the Mallow and Carlow factories.  In addition to contributing to our fuel security, the saving of the Mallow factory could have gone some way towards providing an alternative crop to help our hard-pressed farmers.  Not only has <Col N="1800"/>the Government failed to secure our economic future through the lack of adequate infrastructure, roads and rail, it has failed to make any effort to secure our energy needs.</P>
        <P>By failing to make any progress in these two fundamental areas, the Government has allowed our agriculture industry to die.  Some foresight and planning could have gone a long way to securing energy for our future and could at the same time have revitalised our agriculture sector.  There would then have been no need for former sugar factory workers from the Mallow sugar factory to spend another day picketing outside Greencore yesterday seeking their just redundancy entitlements, a claim the Labour Court has upheld no fewer than three times.  It is time the Government intervened with Greencore to ensure that workers who worked hard in the industry over the past 30 years get proper and just compensation.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s lack of planning and foresight represents a lost opportunity for the economy to secure a start in producing a native source of environmentally friendly fuel and to provide an alternative viable crop for our farming community.  Also, the Government continues to fail to ensure that a small proportion of the money Greencore is getting from EU taxpayers is put towards paying proper redundancy payments for the workers of the Mallow factory.</P>
        <P>After the closure of the Mallow beet factory, Cork County Council commissioned a study with the objective of providing a factual evaluation of the technical and financial viability of ethanol production from beet and wheat at the former sugar factory.  The following areas were addressed in the study: Irish and international policy on renewable energy, ethanol market dynamics, the process and economics of ethanol production, the viability of the Mallow site for ethanol production and the macro-economic and environmental effects of ethanol production.</P>
        <P>The European Union biofuel directive states that member states must replace 5.75% of petrol and diesel with biofuels by 2010.  This would be the equivalent of 220 million litres of ethanol.  Therefore, a market for fuel that could be produced from the sugar factory already existed and all that was needed was for the Minister to put a tax relief scheme in place to make the proposition viable.</P>
        <P>The council study proved that the supply of wheat and beet would be available to the factory.  Some 10,000 hectares were likely to be available for beet production and 12,000 hectares for wheat.  These would have produced more than 220 million litres of ethanol.  The level of economic support required would be 26 cent per litre produced from beet and 14 cent per litre produced from wheat.  In total, it would only cost the Exchequer &euro;40 million per annum to run the plant to full capacity.  This support would enable reasonable prices of &euro;40 per tonne for beet and &euro;145 per tonne for wheat to be paid to farmers. <Col N="1801"/> Sugar beet grown for the production of ethanol would also provide an ideal rotation crop for cereals such as winter wheat and spring barley.</P>
        <P>The ethanol production process would help our economy overcome significant dependence on a foreign energy supply and improve the balance of trade and payments in the energy area.  Ethanol burns more cleanly than petrol and produces fewer emissions.  A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of up to two thirds can be achieved through the substitution of ethanol for petrol as a transport fuel.</P>
        <P>Everybody and every area wins in the ethanol production scenario.  The environment, the economy, security of supply and our balance of payments all benefit.  Less carbon taxes will be payable, farmers will have a viable crop and industry will create environmentally friendly jobs.  As far as I am concerned the ethanol proposal was a &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;, but we have failed to act on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Durkan on tabling this important motion.  This economy has moved from fifth most competitive to 89th in the world.  That gives a clear indication of the stacked up costs of doing business.  Regarding power, the stacked up costs are 9%, which is very high.  While VAT can be reclaimed on commercial property, it is an injustice that it should be charged on domestic use.  It is a huge taxation on those who can ill afford to pay, particularly the elderly.</P>
        <P>During the past five years, more than 33,000 manufacturing jobs have relocated to more competitive economies.  It is disappointing to hear the IDA acknowledge that we are seeking added value jobs which puts paid to the possibility of retaining jobs.  We all hear about the boom in the economy, which is driven by the construction industry.  Recent job announcements have been few and far between, bar high-tech jobs.  All the graduates in the north west have to leave the region.  That Ireland has moved from fifth place to 89th in terms of competitiveness indicates a problem.</P>
        <P>The latest ESB price increases are 19.4% for residential consumers, 19.6% for SMEs and 21% for large industrial consumers.  Such increases have a direct impact on large companies such as Abbott Laboratories in Sligo, which employes a large number of people.  A gas price increase of 34% will add up to &euro;300 to the average domestic annual bill.  The net losers are the consumers but equally important are employers who create jobs.  Given the enlarged Europe, one can relocate in a lower priced economy.  That is the point made by my colleague, Deputy Hogan, who has the review of the State regulators.  In respect of every job here, there is delegated responsibility.  The Minister is not responsible; he passes the buck to somebody else who has been appointed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the National Competitiveness Council is a damning account of the Government&rsquo;s failure to address spiralling business costs <Col N="1802"/>and the decline in competitiveness of the economy.  It shows that the Government has made little progress in addressing spiralling business costs in recent years.  This has resulted in the collapse of certain export markets and the repatriation to America of &euro;18 billion per year in profits.  As we speak, interest charges, which were 6%, are being increased.  All these increases are stacked up costs.  For every &euro;100 million borrowed from the banks, the State indirectly gets &euro;30 million arising from tax on tax as this is very much a taxation economy.</P>
        <P>That VAT on power supply in the UK is less than half the rate here is an indication of how wrong is our taxation system.  The problem arises when trying to generate jobs, especially in small companies, and ultimately their survival.  A new company, Mayo Power Plate, which will open shortly in Mayo and is backed by a consortium of investors, will be of major benefit to County Sligo.  The plant should provide a major source of employment to farmers who will use the wood and other products as a major field source.  This will be of substantial benefit to the region.  A massive area of ground is under afforestation.  It will take the thinnings of afforestation and wants to be backed as an alternative energy supplier in Mayo.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak and congratulate Deputy Durkan on tabling the motion.  The first line refers to the likelihood of major job losses in both the manufacturing and services sectors in the wake of recently approved gas and electricity price increases.  I can speak of job losses in my constituency of Limerick West &mdash; 400 in Castlemahon, 300 in Kantoher and 50 in Microtherm Limited in Bruff &mdash; during the past 12 months.  We have proposals to develop bio alternative energy in our constituency, which is an opportunity for the Government to support replacement jobs.  </P>
        <P>Capway Bioenergy is proposing to set up a bioenergy facility in Foynes which would employ more than 50 people.  There is Government support for this project.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment last week and I ask the Minister for Finance to look favourably on this project because it will counteract in some small way the job losses in Limerick West.  In Adare, we have a project for the growing of Miscanthus grass<b>.  </b>There are great opportunities in this project as we have seen in the UK and Europe where this environmentally friendly system could support farmers in the area whose life has changed dramatically during the past ten years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I wish to speak about bioenergy policy.  The level of funding available to energy action and all those similarly engaged with the specific focus of bringing existing housing stock up to the insulation standards of newly built houses is totally inadequate.  The grant should be extended to householders who wish to convert existing home heating technology to renewable energy up to the value of between &euro;500 and &euro;3,500.  The grant aid to householders who wish to properly insulate their homes should be up to the value of &euro;500.</P>
        <P>We should move towards a target of 33% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity needs from renewable sources by 2025 through a mix of direct State investment and a regulatory regime that gives access to the national grid to renewable energy sources above all others.  The State should prioritise the creation of a network of wind turbines to harness the potential of wind energy, especially offshore wind energy.  Our potential to do this is the best in the EU.</P>
        <P>Investment and commitment will ensure the putting in place of the necessary interconnecting infrastructure which will ensure continuity of supply in the event of a reduction in wind supply.  Consideration should be given to the separation of the ESB from the national grid, a matter on which I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view.  This would ensure a level playing field for all energy suppliers.  In my council area, there is a massive 200 acre landfill.  There is an opportunity to recover landfill gas in all landfill sites and waste water treatment plants as far as practicable for the generation of electricity to be fed into the national grid and for private use.  Bord na M&oacute;na should be included in the overall development of energy policy, given its expertise as an energy provider and its ability to play a meaningful role.</P>
        <P>With regard to the project for west County Limerick, all excise duty on biofuels produced from renewable crops should be removed.  That is key to developing a biofuel industry.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This Government is committed to creating the conditions to keep energy price rises to a minimum.  We are committed to a strong, vibrant and competitive economy.  While any increase in energy prices is unwelcome, these are primarily a function of an upward shift in global commodity prices, particularly in respect of oil and gas.  They are also a result of our location and of our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  The motion gives me the opportunity to outline the concrete steps which the Government has taken and is taking to mitigate the vulnerability we face as an island nation on the periphery of Europe with few interconnections and a heavy dependence on foreign fossil fuels.  This backdrop highlights the hypocrisy of Fine Gael Deputies in tabling this motion and reveals their tunnel vision and insular perspective on the global challenges we face.  It also reveals their short-sightedness in refusing to contribute positively to the development of an agreed policy on such important areas as renewable energy and a vision for the future on an all-party basis, as proposed by Deputy Eamon Ryan of the Green Party.</P>

	<P>We are all in agreement that the continued success of the Irish economy can only be guaranteed if it is underpinned by sound energy policies.  Fine Gael should not be playing political games with an issue critical to the well-being of our people, especially given that its Deputies know little about the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not be playing, either.  He does not need to prove his ineptitude any further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A recent programme of investment in the electricity networks has sought to address the need to meet ever increasing demands.  Further investment is required in areas such as interconnection and will have to be paid for by the consumer or, indirectly, by the taxpayer.  Ireland&rsquo;s main energy challenges are largely a consequence of its geographical situation.  As an island on the western edge of Europe, lacking significant confirmed hydrocarbon deposits and subject to rapid economic growth, it is inevitable that Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on external sources of fuel will, at least in the short term, exceed the average European level.  Over the longer term, however, our geography is also a source of opportunity for Ireland, particularly in regard to the potential for more intensive exploitation of renewable energy.  Success will require that the technologies involved are economical compared to traditional sources of energy and that market conditions provide appropriate incentives for producers.</P>
        <P>I commend the Government on its continued commitment to delivering on energy policy priorities and meeting national and international energy challenges.  As a direct result of Government policy, Ireland is well positioned to manage these challenges.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment was underlined by the launch of the energy Green Paper, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, which addresses the challenges for Irish energy to 2020 and beyond and sets out both the policy actions currently underway and the policy options for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s policies are all in the future.  It could not even produce a White Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Paper sets out the Government&rsquo;s priorities and forms a basis for consultation with the public and stakeholders.  It aims to engender serious, constructive and structured debate on energy policy.  The Government is open to considering all proposals for ensuring <Col N="1808"/>competitive, sustainable and secure supplies of energy to 2020 and beyond.</P>
        <P>The all-island energy market, which was not mentioned by any Fine Gael speaker, is a cornerstone of energy policy, in line with EU priorities on market integration and interconnection.  This project represents a co-ordinated approach to energy policy North and South.  The framework was developed by the authorities on both sides of the Border in the context of continuing co-operation between both Governments on common energy issues.  The all-island energy market will deliver a range of benefits, including a larger, single market with more competitive energy prices; open and transparent competition at all levels in the marketplace and for all energy sources, including combined heat and power and renewables; a more stable and attractive investment location and consequential improvements to national and international competitiveness of the wider industrial sector; greater security of supply; a robust, integrated infrastructure; a more diverse energy mix; greater energy efficiency; better consumer choice of supplier of energy or of energy services; longer term savings through rationalisation of functions in regulation, system operation and transmission asset planning and ownership; and improved organisation of energy research through the emergence of an all-island network of academic and industry expertise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, why is the Minister raising energy prices?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The all-island energy market will also serve as a stepping stone towards the development of European regional energy markets.  To ensure that Ireland reaps the benefits in terms of competition and security of supply from market integration, the Government has committed to enhanced physical interconnection with our neighbouring energy markets.  As a result of this policy, electricity interconnection capacity with Northern Ireland will be doubled by 2012.  The Government also approved an Exchequer contribution of &euro;12.7 million towards completion of the gas network in Northern Ireland, which will include an extension of the natural gas pipeline from Belfast to Derry and construction of a North-South interconnector.  The State&rsquo;s contribution recognises that cross-Border gas infrastructure is an essential part of the agreed North-South aspiration of an integrated all-island energy market.</P>
        <P>On foot of a recent Government decision, a new 500 MW east to west electricity interconnector between Wales and Ireland will be completed by 2012.  In its progressive decision to secure the construction of the east to west interconnector, the Government noted the advice of the Commission for Energy Regulation on the potential benefits to Ireland of interconnection with the UK market, which include enhanced security of supply, the promotion of competition <Col N="1809"/>in the electricity supply market and integration of Ireland&rsquo;s small, and largely isolated, electricity system into the wider European electricity market.  East-west interconnection will afford Ireland direct and secure access to the UK and EU mainland energy markets.  It will also offer potential opportunities for export of Irish wind generated electricity and to assist that sector.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted in this context that the Government has made specific provision for electricity interconnectors in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  This Act provides for a more streamlined planning procedure for a range of strategic infrastructure developments, including energy infrastructure such as interconnectors.  The Government policy of interconnection and integration with neighbouring markets goes hand in hand with its progressive approach to the liberalisation of the Irish electricity and gas markets.</P>
        <P>In 2005, we introduced a statutory instrument, SI 60 of 2005, which provided for the implementation of a suite of liberalisation measures, including the full opening of the retail electricity market in Ireland.  This occurred on 19 February 2005, when all 1.8 million customers became free to shop around for their electricity supplier.  This date is well in advance of the July 2007 deadline for full liberalisation of the electricity markets as set down by the EU in the Second Electricity Directive.</P>
        <P>To underpin and accelerate electricity market liberalisation, I asked Deloitte &amp; Touche, in the context of preparing the Green Paper, to undertake a review of the Irish electricity sector and provide a comprehensive in-depth analysis of institutional arrangements and market structures.  It found that the size of the Irish market is a significant factor as is the dominance of ESB arising from its ownership of a large and diverse portfolio of plant and particularly from its ability to set prices.</P>
        <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report states that without changing the current structure, we will continue to face difficulties in attracting new entrants to develop competition and choice for consumers.  The market will evolve slowly without a competitive downward pressure on prices.  There will be few opportunities to break the current cycle of market evolution.  None of the Fine Gael speeches referred to this matter.  This scenario is not in the interests of market players or consumers, nor is it in the interests of the competitiveness of energy costs and the economy.  The Deloitte &amp; Touche report is a useful contribution to the energy debate and the analysis is incorporated in the Green Paper.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises the fundamental role played by the ESB in the economic and social development of the State and the strategic value of maintaining the ESB as a strong and commercially viable company into the future.  The retention of natural monopoly networks in State ownership is also a core policy tenet for the <Col N="1810"/>Government.  What the electricity market needs is more competition, more innovation and more choice for consumers.  Threatening to sack the regulator, as Fine Gael has asked me to do tonight, will not enhance the market.  It will do nothing for confidence in the market and certainly will not increase competition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister not justify the reasons?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Structural reform is necessary in the interests of the market, the consumer and the ESB.  Enhanced competition in generation will act as a catalyst for improvements in operation and maintenance costs, productivity, availability, flexibility and innovation.  The ESB&rsquo;s dominance in mid-merit price-setting generation increases the potential for abuse of market power and thereby does little to incentivise investment by independent players.  I am very conscious that new players need to be encouraged to invest in this market segment to redress this position.  I am confident that the establishment of the single electricity market, with its proposed use of a capacity payment mechanism, helps the process of beginning to deal with this issue in a positive way.</P>
        <P>I am also proposing the option of creating a &ldquo;land bank&rdquo; of suitable power generation sites to offer a predictable pattern of access to suitable generation sites in Ireland for new entrants to this market.  This would remove a significant barrier to new entry and has been used successfully elsewhere to encourage new entry.  This option would see all suitable sites being effectively controlled by an independent body, such as CER or the TSO, which is EirGrid, and being made available to new entrants to the market as necessary.  These new structural and institutional arrangements are important features of the evolution of a truly liberalised and competitive electricity market in Ireland.  In this context I also welcome the establishment of EirGrid as a fully-fledged legally independent transmission system operator on 1 July.  This is another critical milestone in the process of opening up the Irish electricity market in line with Government policy and with the EU internal energy market.</P>
        <P>The Government has embarked on a process of opening the natural gas market progressively.  As of 1 July 2004, all industrial and commercial consumers are free to shop around for their own natural gas supplier.  The final stage in this process, the full opening of the gas market to the domestic level, is provided for in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, which is currently on Report Stage in this House.</P>
        <P>I have already outlined the challenges faced by all EU member states and the wider international community in dealing with increasingly volatile international fuel prices.  While it is clearly not within the power of any one country to impact upon this market volatility, we can take steps to <Col N="1811"/>mitigate our exposure to fuel price fluctuations through enhanced fuel diversity and energy efficiency, and this will be addressed fully in the White Paper.</P>
        <P>The Government has a long-term and ongoing commitment to encouraging and supporting indigenous fuel sources, exemplified by the public service obligation imposed on ESB to utilise peat for power generation.  The Government is committed to progress a full range of policy options to ensure that Ireland is not excessively exposed to any single fuel or supply source.  The Green Paper outlines a number of options, including co-firing, clean-coal technology and a significant expansion of the use of renewable sources.  While the Green Paper sets specific and ambitious targets, they are ultimately achievable for the proportion of electricity consumption the Government aims to have generated from renewable sources by 2020.  We have proposed a 30% target, which represents a doubling of the 2010 target.  We have set about supporting this objective by the new &euro;119 million renewable energy feed in tariff, which is a vital component of Government policy, representing the most important incentive mechanism for the construction of new renewable energy generation.  The REFIT scheme critically underpins the ambitious targets we have set.  As outlined in our programme, we are also committed to the use of wind and tidal energy.</P>
        <P>We can show real evidence of practical actions in other areas on the renewable side, including the comprehensive range of grant supports to develop greener homes, commercial bioheat, the CHP and the biofuels initiative.  The Government recently launched a major national awareness campaign focusing on energy efficiency, which is positive.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Fine Gael motion calls on me to do two things, to initiate a full review of the regulatory arrangements which approve price increases for electricity and gas and to introduce legislation to enable the Oireachtas to compel the CER to instigate a review of prices at any time so that price movements can be factored into the cost of energy.  Last April Fine Gael published what purported to be a national plan for alternative energy as its response to what it sees as the energy crisis that faces us.  That threadbare review makes no mention of regulation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to speak directly about the issues of electricity and gas price increases and the regulatory framework.</P>
        <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have operated in an open and constructive way at all times.  All of the industry stakeholders have been given their chance before the committee to have their say on energy policy and on issues such as prices, the need to keep the lights on and to keep industry in business with secure supplies, and the way the energy regulator operates.</P>
        <P>I am not entirely happy with some of the CER&rsquo;s decisions.  People cannot understand why electricity and gas prices are so high.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The CER is accountable to the committee which I chair and has been brought before the committee on numerous occasions to explain its decisions and its actions, in line with the statutory duties and responsibilities given to it by the Oireachtas under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, various other amending legislation in 2002 and all other statutory instruments introduced in recent years.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the Minister does not have a function regarding electricity and gas pricing.  If the Oireachtas decides otherwise, so be it but I have not heard many calls in our committee to reverse that decision.</P>
        <P>The CER is given responsibility for regulating ESB&rsquo;s public electricity supply tariffs under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  Prior to CER regulation, the ESB, by custom and practice, sought Government approval before increasing its tariffs.</P>
        <P>Confusion may exist about the relationship between the opening of the electricity market and the rebalancing of tariffs.  Tariffs rose by only 3.5% in nominal terms between 1986 and 2001 compared to 52.5% inflation in the same period.  That led eventually to generation costs being under-recovered and grid investment was postponed.</P>
        <P>The Government has undertaken a major investment programme on the electricity transmission and distribution systems to create the environment for additional generation capacity to meet increasing demand.  In this regard, it is <Col N="1814"/>worth noting that energy infrastructure is currently paid for by the users and not the State as is the case, for example, in regard to roads and water.</P>
        <P>The multi-billion euro infrastructure investment programme represents a trebling of the investment in the transmission system and a doubling in the distribution system in the period 2001-05 compared with previous years.</P>
        <P>The CER reviews ESB costs when assessing ESB applications for changes to its tariff prices.  As part of this process, the CER also operates a consultation process.  Regarding Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s natural gas tariffs, which are also regulated by the CER since 2002, it is important to keep in mind that natural gas is traded worldwide and prices are determined by supply and demand.</P>
        <P>Until 2002, natural gas tariffs had effectively remained unchanged in Ireland since the mid-1990s, despite a steep rise in the cost of natural gas during that period.  The price freeze was based on favourable long-term contracts negotiated by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann with suppliers and, as these have gradually run out, the price increases have come on-stream to ensure that BGE&rsquo;s supply costs are realistically reflected in the prices being charged.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the management and the board of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann for being able to keep those prices and for putting in place long-term contracts with suppliers over many years.</P>
        <P>I remind the Deputies that the challenge Ireland faces in managing increasing energy costs are not unique.  The European Union Green Paper, A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, notes that oil and gas prices are rising and have nearly doubled in the EU over the past two years, with electricity prices following.  It is important to note that two years ago the price of a barrel of oil was $35.  It went to a high of $78 and is back to $60 today.  OPEC said today it would reduce the supply by 1.2 million barrels a day to keep the prices as high as possible.</P>
        <P>The EU Green Paper points to greater energy efficiency and innovation as the means by which member states may realistically address rising energy costs.  In this context, I heartily commend the Government for its initiatives on both of these fronts, exemplified by the recent launch of the energy efficiency Power of One campaign and of the new Charles Parsons Energy Research Awards.  I commend the Minister for his Power of One initiative.  I encourage every citizen in the State to take notice of that programme and to be energy effective and efficient.  No Deputy is happy with the CER approved price increases, despite the fact that we are essentially price takers in this market.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach on energy policy is to be commended.  It is dealing with issues such as security of supply, energy pricing, fuel diversity, the environment, renewable sources of energy, infrastructure development and the all-<Col N="1815"/>island energy agenda.  Sterling work is being done and must be recognised.  I am disappointed that the Members on the opposite side of the House do not recognise that.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the single electricity market, SEM, has the potential to drive cost efficiency in the electricity industry which in turn can lead to consequential improvements to the national and international competitiveness of the wider industrial and commercial sectors of the economy.  I commend the Government for its planned contribution of &euro;12.7 million to the completion of the gas network in Northern Ireland in recognition that cross-Border gas infrastructure is an essential part of the agreed North-South aspiration of an integrated all-Ireland energy market.  I am pleased to note that the Government&rsquo;s decision to pursue east-west electricity interconnection will afford Ireland direct and secure access to the United Kingdom energy markets and onwards to the EU mainland market.</P>
        <P>My committee&rsquo;s energy report published last June contained 38 recommendations, following 18 days of hearings, and a detailed road map to energy policy development.  I thank my colleague on the opposite bench, Deputy Durkan, and Deputy Broughan for their valuable contribution to those 38 recommendations.  I am pleased to note, and I hope I have been reading the same Green Paper as Deputy Durkan, that the Green Paper absorbed many of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations and informed much of the Government&rsquo;s thinking on the new policy.</P>

	<P>I am particularly pleased that issues such as security of supply, competitiveness, market development and the whole renewable energy area have received attention, as well as the need for consumers and business voices to be heard in the interface with the regulator.</P>
        <P>I support with enthusiasm the Government&rsquo;s intention to bring forward a review of the energy regulatory framework.  The public needs to understand how and why price decisions are taken.  The public also needs to be satisfied that if fuel prices decrease, their bills will reflect that as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I therefore welcome the undertaking made by the energy regulator at a meeting of our joint committee on 4 October to consider the option of a fuel cost variation mechanism within energy tariffs.  I understand that the CER has now indicated that it will hold a public consultation on this issue by the end of this year.  I welcome that initiative.</P>

        <P>The question is whether we should remain with our current cost base regulation which we, as Members of this House, passed in this Oireachtas or move to incentive based regulation.  Those are the questions that must be put to Members when we review the regulator&rsquo;s role because the regulator has a function to ensure costs are recovered by the ESB.

        <P>Energy and energy price rises are probably the most important issues on the political agenda now and for the foreseeable future.  Since 2000, householders and businesses have been hit with unprecedented increases in energy prices.  Since then, there have been year-on-year price hikes of exceptional magnitude.  Electricity prices for domestic consumers have increased by more than 66% overall since 2002.  They increased by 13.2% in 2002, 5% in 2003, 8.6% in 2004, 4% in 2005 and 3.1% in 2006.  They will increase by 19.4% this coming January.  The cost of gas increased by 9.1% in 2003, 10.7% in 2004 and 25.26% in 2005.  There was an astonishing increase of 34% on 31 October 2006.  This has meant an incredible increase of 102% in gas prices since 2002.</P>
        <P>Despite the bluster of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, it is clear the Irish experience of deregulation has been an unmitigated disaster in terms of securing lower prices for consumers.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>IBEC called on the Government this morning to address the serious issues that are now facing the food and drink industry, which it described as one of the most important to the economy.  I back this call but I am sorry Government action was not instigated before the recent devastating announcement by Cadbury Ireland that 450 jobs are to be lost over the coming years in Coolock, which is in my constituency of Dublin North East.  The company stated one of the key reasons for the cuts is skyrocketing energy costs and the accompanying loss of competitiveness.  This constitutes another body blow for Coolock and the north side of the city.  The Acting Chairman and I have worked long and hard on a number of initiatives to try to reverse unemployment trends in the region.  Sadly, due to the incompetence of the Government, the jobs at the Cadbury plant are being placed in jeopardy.</P><Col N="1818"/>
        <P Just="Left">This week, we all received a very interesting document from Forf&aacute;s, Statement on the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland.  It states utility costs, especially the cost of electricity, comprise a key business input cost that weakens Ireland&rsquo;s overall cost competitiveness.  It emphasises that &ldquo;Food processing (23 per cent of total costs) and biopharmaceutical manufacturing (22 per cent) are particularly sensitive to utility costs&rdquo;.  This is very worrying as the pharmaceutical and food processing sectors play such important roles in our manufacturing industry.</P>
        <P>An interesting statistic in the Forf&aacute;s document is that Cork, Dublin and Galway rank as having more expensive electricity, gas, water and waste disposal costs than any other city surveyed across the world, apart from Maastricht in Holland.  The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s publication must now act as an urgent wake-up call for the lethargic outgoing Government with regard to energy.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recently received correspondence from Mr. R. G. Budden, the managing director of Wellman International Limited, a fibres manufacturer in Kells, which is in the Minister&rsquo;s backyard.  Mr. Budden stated: &ldquo;I should like to make abundantly clear the very serious consequences for my company, and for employment in manufacturing in Ireland that arise from the current malaise on government energy policy.&rdquo;  He refers to the &ldquo;wilful destructiveness&rdquo; of the energy regulator and states, astonishingly, that &ldquo;the increases in electricity costs currently foreseen for 2007 could be sufficient of themselves to force this company (employing 300 people) into liquidation&rdquo;.  If the Minister is not prepared to take care of his own constituency, he will not care for any.  Deputy Carty will agree with me in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>He is well able to take care of it.</P>

	<P>I hope he will.</P>
        <P>The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, has claimed the cost of electricity for SMEs has risen by 89% in the past five years.  It also claimed energy costs are now the &ldquo;number one enemy&rdquo; for SMEs.  ISME reported that the recently sanctioned 34% increase in the price of gas will result in an additional energy bill of &euro;13,000 per annum and that a &ldquo;typical SME will have to increase turnover by &euro;250,000&rdquo; to pay for the increased cost of gas.  Clearly, across the spectrum of opinion, business leaders believe the Minister and CER have totally failed to address the devastating impact of increases in energy costs, especially in respect of electricity and gas.</P>
        <P>In his motion, Deputy Durkan rightly dealt with the pernicious impact of soaring energy costs on national competitiveness.  Let me highlight the devastating problem of fuel poverty which these <Col N="1819"/>increases have caused throughout the country.  During my walkabouts and at my information clinics, it has become clear to me that the terrible financial burden price rises have imposed on families represents a disaster.  The Acting Chairman has had a similar experience in his constituency, which is beside mine.</P>
        <P>During last year&rsquo;s bitterly cold winter, I talked to numerous senior citizens who were wearing big overcoats in their homes during the day to stave off the cold and damp because they were so fearful of the bills that would accrue if they turned up their heating.  The past two winters were the coldest I can remember and it appears the coming winter will be similar.  In spite of this, energy prices are going through the roof as we are beginning to deal with the possibly disastrous impact of climate change.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, I raised the very serious matter of energy poverty with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on behalf of some very vulnerable senior citizens in my constituency.  Eastern Community Works Limited, with which Deputy Carey will be familiar, is an agency of the Health Service Executive that assists senior citizens and citizens with disabilities to carry out essential improvements to their homes.  When we contacted the organisation last May, we discovered its total budget to assist senior citizens and vulnerable families in 2006 had run out in the middle of April.  This shows the concern the heartless outgoing Administration has for the most vulnerable families in our HSE region.  This is an appalling state of affairs.</P>
        <P>We were told recently by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that a massive &euro;3.5 million of its annual budget will be used over the coming winter months to help families to pay gas and electricity bills.  The society also warned that far too few people are eligible to claim supports for fuel bills and that too many people will be left struggling to pay their heating and light bills this summer.</P>
        <P>I have quoted many times in this House the famous report of the sociology department in UCD which states excess mortality in this city and every county in the State could be directly attributable to fuel poverty.  Nevertheless, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, published a Green Paper on energy that contained only a single page on energy poverty.  This indicated his concern for the poor and vulnerable families.  This is totally unacceptable.  The Deloitte &amp; Touche report, which was published on the same day as the Green Paper, states almost one in five Irish people is defined as &ldquo;fuel poor&rdquo;.  This is an astonishing legacy for any Government.  One in five of our citizens will deliberately cut back on their energy use tonight and every night during the coming winter, which could be as cold as the last two winters, because they cannot afford the prices set by the Government.  We have gone <Col N="1820"/>through the rigmarole of hearing the bluster of the chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources about CER and regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is responsible for energy price rises?  I refer to the sky-rocketing prices of gas and electricity.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Taoiseach are responsible.  The Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Administration is totally responsible for the suffering that will ensue this winter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I urge the Minister to address this matter post haste and, in particular, to examine what can be done in the budget.  He should consider the miserable fuel allowance of &euro;14, the low number of fuel units that people are allowed in respect of electricity and the appalling response of the Government to those who need assistance with their fuel bills.  It is not just low-income families who are being pummelled by soaring fuel prices.  Families with relatively comfortable incomes are also feeling the increasing pinch on household budgets as family fuel costs soar above &euro;2,000.  If one adds the various costs together, they are heading for &euro;3,000.  This issue was discussed when I was on a radio programme with one of the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s colleagues.  When we spoke on 98FM about the size of household gas bills, for example, people came on the airwaves to read from their bills, citing figures of over &euro;1,500 per annum.  The Government&rsquo;s response has been to act like a bemused bystander.  It wants the electorate to think there is nothing it can do, but the electorate will remember.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is trying to hypnotise the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that the people will hold Government Deputies and Ministers to account in this regard.  It is clear that the current ministerial directives to CER urgently need to be reviewed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this aspect of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s motion.  I have tried to propose a number of key changes to the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill 2006, which we considered last week and which will come before the House again shortly, to try to ensure that the needs of consumers &mdash; small businesses and householders &mdash; are taken into account.  I have tabled an amendment to propose that a key consumer panel be established within CER.  Under the proposal, the three commissioners &mdash; there are just <Col N="1821"/>two at present &mdash; would have to take the views of the panel strongly into account.  They should not be able to gloss over concerns of this nature.  They should not be able to tell the joint committee that they are basically giving money to the utilities for increases last year and the year before.  It has to be said that profitable companies seem to have been able to manage such matters.  The ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann have made bumper profits in recent years, despite the so-called oil increases.</P>
        <P>I strongly back Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s call for a full review of the regulatory arrangements which have led to the sanctioning of unjustified price increases.  A number of organisations in the United Kingdom have been established by the Government there to represent the people in respect of energy costs, particularly in a deregulated market.  One of these interesting bodies is Energywatch, which has been put in place on a statutory basis on behalf of the people.  It is able to draw constant attention to what is happening in the gas, electricity, oil and car fuel sectors.  The Labour Party has long advocated the inclusion of a consumer panel and other mechanisms within the institutional structure of CER to ensure there is an adequate reflection of consumer views in energy pricing policy.  That is something we will ask the House to vote on over the next week or so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I hand over to my colleague, Deputy Lynch, I have to say that the Government&rsquo;s performance on energy pricing has been a disaster.  The Government, rather than the regulator, is responsible for this matter.  It has been a disaster for business in this country.  It is eroding our competitiveness.  It has been a disaster for householders, in particular.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been a disaster for the 20% of our citizens who are vulnerable.  I refer to senior citizens, other vulnerable families and families on welfare.  The Minister has to act by taking the necessary steps.  Perhaps he should just support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Fine Gael for tabling this motion and I thank my colleague, Deputy Broughan, for sharing his time with me, which I <Col N="1822"/>appreciate.  This is a fundamental issue.  We sometimes forget what people fundamentally need to lead healthy and comfortable lives.  The Members of this House are particularly likely to forget such matters, as we often become isolated.  At this stage of the country&rsquo;s development, we are right to expect certain things, especially in light of the buoyancy of our economy and the extent to which wealth is created in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>If one is to exist in a reasonable fashion, one needs a roof over one&rsquo;s head, a good diet and warmth.  They are basic and fundamental requirements.  The Government has ensured that people cannot afford to put a roof over their heads.  Most people are staying at home for far longer than they ever did before.  When people manage to put a roof over their heads, they have to work longer hours at an exorbitant rate to ensure it stays there.  They have to endure the constant worry that it will be lost.  I could go through the 30 stealth taxes which have been introduced by the Government since 2002.</P>
        <P>We also need to consider the compound effect of how much it costs to heat one&rsquo;s home.  People will be put to the pin of their collar this year to meet the cost of that compound effect, on top of their mortgages.  There was a very interesting programme on television last night, called &ldquo;In Search of the Pope&rsquo;s Children&rdquo;.  I compliment the producers and presenter of the programme.  While it showed an Ireland that we all recognise, the combined effect of the programme was to show us that we are in a new Ireland.  The fundamental things I mentioned, such as a roof over one&rsquo;s head, warmth, a good diet and a health service are still needed in the new Ireland.  People need more than BMWs and yummy mummies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about ministerial cars?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I must admit that there were no yummy mummies when I was a mummy.  Other things are needed as well.  Local authorities are installing central heating in all their old properties, starting with houses occupied by people over the age of 60, which is a very good idea.  As someone who was born and reared in a corporation house, I can tell the House that it can be quite cold when a three-bedroom house has just one fire, which is an open coal fire with no back boiler.  It is essential to have central heating in such houses.  However, I was shocked a few months ago to discover that local authorities are installing central heating systems in houses which have had their gas supplies cut off for the past year, and the residents of which cannot afford to have the supplies turned back on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1823"/>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Such houses now have a central heating system with no supply because people cannot afford it.  People living in such houses are turning to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>At this stage in our development, I would have thought that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul should be out of business.  Its philosophy is to put itself out of business when people no longer need its services.  The society has said it will spend half its budget this year on ensuring that people have sufficient heat and will not die of hypothermia.  If people cannot heat very humble homes in this day and age, where are we going?  There are families who are worried about the arrival of the next bill.  I refer not only to families which depend on social welfare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>People are worried that they will not be able to afford to heat their homes or will not be able to afford the hot water needed to bath their children.  Such families are operating with one fire in the sitting room.  I see television advertisements every winter reminding people to check on their elderly neighbours and to make sure they have enough heat.  It is a good thing to check on one&rsquo;s neighbour, but it should not be one&rsquo;s job as a neighbour to ensure that one&rsquo;s elderly next door neighbour has enough heat to stay alive.  That is the Government&rsquo;s job.  It appears we are asking our elderly people, who made the sacrifices that created the Celtic tiger, to make further sacrifices.  I am not an economist, but I find it staggering to read certain figures.  Even though the ESB made a profit of &euro;250 million last year, it is being given an increase of the size we are seeing here.  Of that &euro;250 million, the Government took between &euro;70 million and &euro;72 million, and yet the fuel allowance is &euro;14.  The allowance does not buy a bag of smokeless coal anymore, and it definitely will not pay one&rsquo;s gas or ESB bills.  The Government is a disgrace.  It cannot keep the roofs over people heads or a fire in the hearth.</P>

	<P>The predicament of drift net fishermen is another blow to people living in coastal communities.  These are a finite number of fishermen eking out a living.  They are mostly to be found along the west coast, and particularly in County Mayo.  They have been treated in an unfair manner.  This is something that has been in the pipeline for some time and perhaps it should have been introduced three or four years ago. <Col N="1824"/> These fishermen are being badly penalised because it did not happen at that time.  The amount they are now getting in compensation &mdash; a once off payment that will have to do them for the rest of their lives &mdash; is dependent on their catch, and this has been reduced by 75% in the last five years.</P>
        <P>We all know about how scarce salmon stocks are.  However, this group of fishermen has been badly treated and deserves better.  It is not just about the fishermen themselves, but also their families, particularly their sons who expected to continue the fishing tradition.  They now have no future.  What about the crews who are dependent on the licence holder?  The licence holder is getting a pittance in compensation and is expected to pay his crew from that.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that what has been proposed has been fully thought out.  Farmers, for example, were more equitably treated because they were more organised.  The drift net fishermen were badly organised; they trusted Government and felt it would do the right thing by them but they have been badly let down.  It is not too late for the Minister of State to announce further measures to help these fishermen, their families and their crews.</P>
        <P>This programme may not work out as well as Government thinks.  There was a big loss of salmon at sea.  Salmon will also return to the river of origin, and this may not necessarily be an Irish river.  Drift net fishermen also catch salmon from Scotland, England and elsewhere.  The Government has not given enough thought to what will happen if the increased numbers of salmon return to Irish rivers.  I do not believe the Government has increased the number of fisheries board staff.  I understand the number of such staff has been reduced as part of a plan to privatise and eliminate the body in the long run.  That would also be a retrograde step.</P>
        <P>What does the future hold for these men who will not be adequately compensated?  Hopefully they will not engage in any form of illegality.  Drift net fishermen have always respected and kept the law and, consequently, their catches were lower.  By only fishing when they were permitted to do so, their catches were reduced and they are now paying for that.</P>
        <P>In the north east of England, fishermen were given &pound;70,000 sterling a number of years ago in a buy out in the interests of salmon conservation, and &pound;110,000 sterling is now reported to have been offered to those remaining.  Approximately &euro;2,000 has been offered to our 850 drift net fishermen for a similar buy-out, with &euro;23 euro per salmon caught in the last five years even though a quota reduction of 75% was already operating.  No provision has been made for the drift net crews, nor has any other option been considered for them.  Considering the devastating effect on those men and their families in rural areas for the rest of their lives, this does not seem equitable.  They have no option for satisfaction in the event <Col N="1825"/>of resurgence in salmon stock.  Is the Minister of State considering any other options to help drift net fishermen, their crews and families?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am not in a position to comment on the specifics of the scheme introduced by the UK in 2003, nor am I privy to the arguments or methods used in their deliberations.  As far as I am aware, a much smaller number of licences were involved and it may be the case that average catches per licence were significant.  It must also be borne in mind that the UK licensing regime is different from that in operation in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In March of this year the Government made a commitment to aligning management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice for 2007.  The Government&rsquo;s primary motivation in committing to align with the scientific advice is that of conservation of the wild salmon species.  The salmon has long been regarded as one of Ireland&rsquo;s most prized fish, instilled in our traditional mythology as the brad&aacute;n feasa, the salmon of knowledge, and valued as a cultural, recreational and economic resource.</P>
        <P>Expert scientific advice shows that one third to one half of the salmon numbers returning to rivers in the 1970s and 1980s are currently returning to Irish rivers.  In this regard, it is vital to afford every protection to the remaining stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch.  The current imperative must be to maintain stocks above conservation limits, or at the very least halt the decline.  The scientific advice is unequivocal that the ending of indiscriminate mixed stock fishing at sea and the restriction of angling in certain rivers are essential parts of a national strategy to arrest the decline in wild salmon stocks.  If we do not take action now the relentless deterioration in stocks will continue, leading to the inevitable demise of wild salmon.</P>
        <P>International best practice for the management of North Atlantic salmon requires the adoption of the precautionary approach and the cessation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries.  These are the recommendations of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation and the International Council for the Exploitation of the Sea.  EU obligations require Ireland to comply with the habitats directive, which also prescribes the precautionary approach and requires an end to indiscriminate mixed stock fishing.  The EU Commission has issued a reasoned opinion against Ireland for non-compliance with the habitats directive in our management of the fishery to date.  Ireland could face substantial fines if the European Court of Justice upholds the Commission&rsquo;s complaint.  If we do not end mixed stock fishing in 2007, the EU Commission will unquestionably proceed in its action against Ireland.  We can on the other hand expect a bonus to our repu<Col N="1826"/>tation from neighbouring countries if we proceed on the proposed course.</P>
        <P>In future, the harvest of salmon by any means will be restricted to those stocks of rivers that are meeting their conservation limits.  This means there will be no more indiscriminate capture of fish.  The scientific advice is that this can be best achieved by restricting fishing to bays, estuaries and rivers.  Commercial fishing and recreational angling can continue only on the scientifically identified exploitable surplus.  We have no option, therefore, but to move to single stock management.</P>
        <P>The Government recognised that compliance with scientific advice from 2007 onwards could mean hardship for commercial fishermen and vulnerable coastal communities and appointed an independent group to examine all the implications of aligning with scientific advice for commercial salmon fishing.  The Government approved the implementation of the scheme recommended by this group.  The group informed the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that it regarded the scheme as generous.  There are 877 holders of drift net licences and the degree of hardship varies greatly among this group given that, in 2005, 445 licence holders caught fewer than 50 fish and only three licence holders caught more than 1,000.  Drift net fishing has also been a seasonal activity concentrated in only two months of the year.</P>
        <P>The Government has approved the establishment of a &euro;25 million fund to address this hardship and the amount to be paid to individuals will be determined by reference to their average verifiable catch for each licence holder for the past five years &mdash; 2001 to 2005 &mdash; and in all cases a payment equal to six times the current licence fee in respect of each licence surrendered will be made.  In addition the Government is establishing a community support scheme to a value of &euro;5 million to support the development of additional economic opportunities in communities affected by the closure of the drift-net fishery.  The focus of this measure will primarily be on those communities where drift net fishing has been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on their economic and social fabric.</P>

	<P>There is a real danger that Bluebell ABA School for children with autism will have to close if it is not assisted by the Government with funding this year.  That is why I am raising the issue as a matter of urgency.  Parents are fearful for their children, who have been making wonderful progress and are so very content in the Bluebell environment.  Bluebell was founded by parents in March 2004 and caters for six children in a rented house in a residential area of the Limerick suburbs.</P><Col N="1827"/>
        <P>Parents have managed to keep the school going through using home tuition grants and constant fundraising.  They are worried, however, that even that tenuous funding is now at risk because the Department of Education and Science has told some of them that home tuition grants may be withdrawn.  I urge the Minister for Education and Science to sanction the funding of Bluebell directly by her Department to put an end to the uncertainty and worry those families are suffering.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Already some 12 ABA schools have departmental funding, and I understand that two others have been approved.  None is in Limerick, the third city of the Republic, and it is about time that Bluebell ABA school in that city was recognised.  I know that the others that have received recognition are doing wonderful work, as is Bluebell, but its future is currently very insecure.</P>
        <P>I recently visited the school, one of the most positive experiences that I have had for some time.  It is clear that the children are benefiting from the environment and methods suited to their specific needs.  From observing them and seeing how they interact with those with whom they deal at Bluebell, I have no doubt that those children would not be able to adapt to the traditional school classroom at this stage in their development.  They do not have the skills to survive in a normal classroom.</P>
        <P>One of the Bluebell parents explained matters by saying that children with autism are trapped inside their own minds, aware of their surroundings but unable to make sense of them.  As well as teaching ABCs, they teach those children how to exist in the world around them, something that will be a cornerstone of their futures and a key to unlocking their potential to understand and participate in their world.  By investing in autism-specific education at an early age, we can give those special children a real chance in life.  If we do not, they and their families may face a future of constant battling for services and the understanding of those around them.</P>
        <P>If we want to be purely mercenary about it, I have no doubt whatsoever that the State will save a great deal by addressing the needs of those children appropriately at an early age.  I cannot overstate the commitment of the parents whom I met at that school.  They are desperate to keep it going and offer the same opportunity to other parents, but they are very tired of constantly having to raise funds and battling to maintain what they have put in place.  They are very concerned for their children&rsquo;s futures.  If the school is granted recognition, it will be able to move to a new site and take more children.  There is a long waiting list at present.</P>
        <P>I understand that it has been offered a site should it be given the go-ahead to establish a purpose-built school.  They propose to increase numbers gradually over a five-year period, taking an extra five children each year up to a maximum <Col N="1828"/>of 20.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to grant recognition and secure funding to Bluebell school.  It cannot be allowed to close its doors for lack of funds.  I make that appeal in the knowledge that the school is in genuine danger of closing owing to the loss of home tuition grants.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and apologise for the Minister&rsquo;s absence.  It provides me with the opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding educational provision for pupils with autistic spectrum disorders, ASD.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the commitment of the Department of Education and Science to ensuring that all children, including those with ASD, receive an education appropriate to their needs.  In that regard, the Department has established 171 special classes for children with autism attached to special and mainstream schools; five special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome; 16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum; and 12 stand-alone facilities providing an applied behavioural analysis, ABA-specific methodology on a pilot basis.  Approval has also been given for the establishment of a further two such facilities.  The group referred to by the Deputy has applied for inclusion under that scheme.</P>
        <P>The Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children, should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where the children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration.  Pupils with autism who are fully integrated into mainstream school receive individual teaching support for several hours per week, as well as support from special needs assistants and specialist equipment, if required.</P>
        <P>Pupils attending those classes benefit from having a wider range of ASD teaching methodologies open to them, fully qualified national school teachers, a school structure and the option of integration into mainstream classes immediately available, depending on each child&rsquo;s ability and progress.  Schools have the support of the Special Education Support Service, SESS, which is committed to providing continuing training as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Staffing supports for autistic children in special classes in ordinary schools and special schools have a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of six pupils to every teacher.  A minimum of two special needs assistants are provided per class, with the possibility of additional special needs assistant posts being made available up to a 1:1 basis where required.</P>
        <P>The newly established National Council for Special Education and its team of over 70 special <Col N="1829"/>educational needs organisers is also working across the country to ensure that new services are put in place where needed so that children with special needs, including those on the autistic spectrum, have access to appropriate school-based provision.</P>
        <P>I advise the Deputy that the Department of Education and Science is currently considering the application from Bluebell in Limerick for inclusion under the pilot scheme.  I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.  I assure her that I will bring her points to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  As the parent of a physically challenged child, I fully support the efforts of parents in Limerick to have such provision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, for taking this Adjournment debate.  The Kildare Town Ex-Service Men and Women&rsquo;s Association is a group of approximately 35 to 40 retired ex-service personnel.  In total, those men and women have given approximately 750 to 900 years&rsquo; service to the Army on behalf of the State.  Their service has seen them represent their country with distinction in many parts of the world, including the Congo, Cyprus, Lebanon and Iraq.  In total, they had 66 overseas UN service missions, 17 to the Congo, 20 to Cyprus, 28 to Lebanon and one to Iraq.  They acknowledge the work of other organisations and representative bodies and have no problem with them.  However, they feel that they would be best served by an organisation for ex-members in their own area.</P>
        <P>They are already involved in many social and community activities and recognised by their local community for their continued good work and assistance.  Those activities include fundraising for many worthy local and individual cases and assisting local community projects and causes of which they are rightly proud.  The reason for the Adjournment debate is that they feel left out given the fact that in all the years they have represented their members and their community, they have received official recognition on only two occasions, when the Taoiseach invited two of their members to ceremonial celebrations in Kilmainham.</P>
        <P>Given the wonderful service that each and every one of those people has given to the State, and as ambassadors of the State and Army on overseas duties, why have they received so little recognition?  I recently attended our annual commemorative Mass and wreath-laying ceremony and the wonderful turnout from the local community showed how much the people of Kildare appreciate the work the group has carried out and continues to carry out.  After the Mass and <?oasys _ch ?>wreath-laying ceremony, the group held a social function where it presented several cheques to projects and groups from the local community following many fundraising and voluntary efforts. <Col N="1830"/> In a confidential capacity, it also provides financial support for families, especially from the Defence Forces, that may require it.</P>
        <P>Last night, I attended the group&rsquo;s monthly meeting.  It was gratifying and humbling to listen to the letters of thanks and congratulation read out by the group from the various organisations, families and individuals that had received support from the organisation over the year.  However, the one defining issue that hurts this voluntary group more than anything is the total lack of recognition from the Department and the Defence Forces for which they served without fear or favour for most of their adult lives.</P>
        <P>When one considers what these ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen have achieved in forming a group to cater for discussion, debate and social inclusion, and, most importantly, to provide invaluable service to the local community, the least they might be afforded is a degree of recognition.  It is stated that a little recognition goes a long way and I know how much the latter would mean to the group in question, which, despite its wonderful service, feels discriminated against.  Its request for recognition and to be invited to the many parades organised by the Army and the Government would go a long way towards erasing that view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this matter.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, who sends his apologies for being absent.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the official recognition of organisations representing military veterans and the related question of these organisations being invited to appropriate State functions, ceremonies and parades of retired Army groups.  There are three national associations and organisations, representing ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen, which are recognised by the Defence Forces and by the Department of Defence.  These organisations are &Oacute;glaigh N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann Teoranta, ONET, more generally known under its English language title, the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women; the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, IUNVA; and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO.</P>
        <P>ONET holds regular meetings and, on occasion, takes part in parades and marches. ONET is nationally organised and has 48 active branches throughout the country.  Retired military personnel are encouraged to join an appropriate branch for local areas.  IUNVA is another national organisation which holds regular meetings and on occasion takes part in parades and marches.  ARCO is a relatively new association and has not yet taken part in parades and marches but, I understand, has a programme of regular meetings.  The membership of ARCO, as its name implies, is confined to former commissioned officers.</P><Col N="1831"/>
        <P>Both ONET and IUNVA are open to former members of the Permanent Defence Force across all ranks.  Understandably, a number of people would hold membership of both organisations.  Representatives of ONET and IUNVA are invited, as a matter of course, to all major military parades and reviews.  Representatives from both are invited, from time to time, to attend and participate in locally organised regional events at brigade and formation level.  Invitations are, for example, issued in association with events and religious ceremonies commemorating deceased members of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Taoiseach is centrally responsible for the organisation of major State functions such as the National Day of Commemoration and the recent Easter 1916 90th anniversary commemoration.  Both ONET and IUNVA were invited to participate in the Easter commemoration parade and representative contingents of both organisations, exceeding 100 personnel in each case, fully participated.  More generally, the Department of the Taoiseach consults the Department of Defence in respect of invitations for the Defence Forces and for ex-military personnel and veterans organisations, as may be appropriate, in the context of specific events or functions.</P><Col N="1832"/>
        <P>As regards the Kildare Town Ex-Servicemen and Women&rsquo;s Association and in respect of any other such local groups throughout the country, the position is that it is considered inadvisable to afford official recognition to a large number of relatively small organisations.  A multiplicity of such small local organisations would be considered to be detrimental to all concerned in the long term because it would result in duplication and would dissipate human effort and resources.  It would also present serious difficulties for the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces in managing the process.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces advise that, in their professional view, ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen are currently very well served by the officially recognised national organisations, ONET, IUNVA and ARCO.  They suggest that local groups such as the Kildare Ex-Servicemen and Women&rsquo;s Association may wish to consider joining ONET because they could then fully avail of the official umbrella recognition afforded to it.  The association could also then avail of the substantial existing organisational and administrative infrastructure and the vast body of experience that has been developed by ONET over the course of many years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that due to a delay in some Garda Stations making their returns to Garda Headquarters, a conclusive figure of weapons surrendered under the recent Amnesty will not be available until later this week.  However, to date 627 weapons, and not 368 as referred by the Deputy which were surrendered under the Amnesty, have been returned to Garda Headquarters.</P>
        <P>One cannot draw a valid comparison between the recent Amnesty here and the Amnesty in the UK in 2003.  Under the UK Amnesty persons were allowed to hand in illegally held guns and just walk away.  No questions were asked and neither were those surrendering weapons required to present any form of identification or asked for their names.  They were informed, in public notices announcing the amnesty, that there would be no arrests or prosecutions arising out of the surrender of any weapon.</P>
        <P>The basis of our Amnesty, and one which all parties agreed with in the course of the passage of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 through the Oireachtas, was that persons would be required <Col N="1835"/>to give their name and address when surrendering weapons, that the weapons surrendered would be forensically tested and where a surrendered weapon was found to have been used in the commission of a crime both the weapon and forensic evidence could be used in evidence in any subsequent proceedings.  To provide otherwise would, in my view, allow the possibility that criminals would avail of the Amnesty to &ldquo;dump&rdquo; weapons used in the commission of crime thus making it more difficult to secure prosecutions in any further cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to emphasise once again that I never held the view that large numbers of hardened criminals were going to hand over their weapons.  Such criminals can only be dealt with by applying the full rigour of the law; they are and will continue to be pursued relentlessly and brought to justice.  However, I did believe that there were people who had guns and offensive weapons and who would have found it difficult to come forward or to admit that they had weapons in their house or that they had neglected to license them.  The Amnesty afforded such people an opportunity to surrender such weapons safely and I am glad to see that so many availed of the opportunity before the introduction of the new minimum mandatory sentence provided for under the 2006 Act.</P>
        <P>The opportunity afforded by the Amnesty will make the new mandatory sentences fair as well as effective.  These sentences, which came into effect on 1st November, 2006 provide mandatory minimum sentences of between 5 and 10 years for a range of serious firearms offences.</P>
        <P>The court may exercise discretion and impose less than the minimum sentence prescribed where it is satisfied that there are exceptional and specific circumstances for doing so. However, it may only exercise its discretion in the case of a first offence.  Where a person charged with any of the above offences has been previously convicted of any such offence then the court has no discretion and must impose at least the mandatory minimum sentence.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 137 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, last month, the two Garda&iacute; in question were found not guilty on all counts preferred against them, on direction of the trial judge. Both persons had also been subject to disciplinary proceedings pursuant to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 1989.</P>
        <P>Regulation 38 of these Regulations provides that where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has either been convicted or acquitted of an offence, then proceedings under the Discipline Regulations for an alleged breach of discipline shall not be commenced or, if already commenced, shall not be continued if the breach of discipline is in substance the same as the offence for which he has been convicted or acquitted.</P>
        <P>In respect of one of the persons referred to, who is still a serving member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the alleged breach of discipline and the criminal charges of which he was acquitted were in substance the same, I am informed by the Garda authorities that disciplinary proceedings were discontinued in accordance with Regulation 38 of the Disciplinary Regulations.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that the second person acquitted last month of the charges preferred against him was medically discharged from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 18 September, 2006.  As this person is no longer a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, disciplinary proceedings were discontinued.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are, no doubt, also aware, in future, such matters could be addressed by the Ombudsman Commission.  In particular, under Section 102(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Commission will be able to investigate any matter, even where no complaint has been made, where it appears that a member of the Force may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.</P>
        <P>In carrying out a criminal investigation, designated officers of the Ombudsman Commission will have Garda powers, immunities and privileges.  They will be empowered to obtain search warrants, to arrest members of the Force, to detain and question members of the Force and take forensic samples, and to bring charges against them.  Such investigations will therefore be full criminal investigations, carried out independently by the Ombudsman Commission.  The members of the Ombudsman Commission were appointed earlier this year, and it intends to become operational in 2007.</P>
        <P>Finally, I should add that I have already published comprehensive proposals for reform of the Garda disciplinary regulations, and these are now being discussed within the Garda Conciliation Council.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In my reply to a Priority Question from the Deputy on 27 April 2006 I comprehensively set out the position in relation to the process of civilianisation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While I will recap on progress to date, I would like at the outset to state that significant progress is being made on recruitment to a range of new civilian posts, including:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />31 posts in the Garda Telecommunications area;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />28 staff for the Professional Standards Unit, comprising statisticians, analysts and administrative staff;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />10 internal audit posts;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />14 additional teaching / training posts in the Garda College in Templemore; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />29 crime analysts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">At the time that the Civilianisation Report was finalised in 2001 there were 818 civilians carrying out clerical or administrative functions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Today that figure is 1,223, a 50% increase in 5 years.  The recruitment proposals outlined in the course of this reply will add approximately 140 more to this number.  I remain committed to the greatest level of civilianisation consistent with the effective and efficient functioning of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Let me turn now to the 2001 Civilianisation Report under which the Government approved the civilianisation of 496 posts in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be filled on a phased basis over a twenty-year period through natural wastage.  The programme drawn up provided for: the civilianisation of these posts in the short, medium and long term; the transfer of the finance function from Garda District Officers to civilian staff; and the transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Of the 496 posts proposed in 2001 for civilianisation, 296 of these were administrative posts with the balance being specialist posts in areas such as telecommunications, mapping and photography.  While 161 posts were identified for civilianisation in the short term, only a further 27 posts were scheduled to be civilianised in the period 2004 to 2006.  The remaining posts were scheduled to be civilianised over the period up to 2021, including 121 which were to be civilianised in the final year of the programme.  The timescales for implemen<Col N="1838"/>tation reflected an agreement reached at the time with Garda Representative Bodies who I am glad to say have since expressed a wish for a more accelerated programme of civilianisation.  I personally regard that extraordinary lead-in time as completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The initial focus in implementing the programme was on the transfer of the finance function from Garda District Officers to civilian staff and 113 civilian District Finance Officers were accordingly appointed under this process.  The Deputy should be aware that the further replacement of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with civilian staff has been stalled for some time by Equal Pay cases taken by members of the Clerical, Public and Services Union.  The Equality Tribunal found in favour of claimants in seven of fourteen cases taken and an appeal which I have taken in relation to these cases is currently before the Labour Court.  I am, however, pleased to say that other elements of the civilianisation programme are continuing apace and are contributing towards the freeing up of Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.</P>
        <P>I would refer in particular to the establishment, at my own instigation, of the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) in Castlebar, which now has a staffing complement of 162 civilians and is servicing all Garda regions nationally.  Whereas previously Garda&iacute; had to return to their Stations following a crime event to enter data on the PULSE system, they now make a call to the GISC, where civilian colleagues input the data for them, allowing officers to remain &ldquo;on the beat&rdquo;.  This major initiative has freed up significant amounts of  Garda time for continued operational duty.  The Garda authorities are already considering what other tasks could be devolved to the GISC which would release additional Garda resources for front-line policing.</P>
        <P>A further key development has been the transfer of civilian staff to the direct control of the Garda Commissioner, as provided for in the Civilianisation Report and in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  This transfer took place on 16 October last.  In order to support the transfer of these staff to the Commissioner, a new Human Resources Division for civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been established, which when fully operational will have a staffing complement of 37 civilians.  This Division, which will look after the full range of HR requirements of the 1,900 clerical, administrative, professional, technical and industrial civilians now working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will also play a key role in driving forward the wider civilianisation programme.  The Head of the new HR Division has been appointed and a number of staff have now commenced duty, with the remaining staff in the process of being recruited.</P>
        <P>The Civilianisation Report envisaged an enhanced administrative career structure in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but not to the extent that has emerged.  The establishment of the GISC has <Col N="1839"/>added a significant number of supervisory and management posts to the civilian structure.  Furthermore, as part of an agreement reached with staff interests regarding the transfer of civilian staff to the Commissioner, sanction has been granted by the Minister for Finance for an additional 76 civilian clerical and administrative posts to be located around the country on a regional and divisional basis.  Recruitment to these posts will be progressed as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, the Commissioner became the Accounting Officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July of this year.  This transfer of responsibility is being supported by the recruitment of nine civilian staff for a new Finance and Procurement Unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would also mention that a new civilian Accommodation Manager has been appointed and commenced duty in September last.</P>
        <P>The Joint Implementation Group comprising management representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department is continuing its work on civilianisation.  Given that the 2001 Civilianisation Report was written at a particular point in time, the Group is taking account of changes which have occurred in the interim in the environment in which civilianisation is being pursued and looking at ways in which the civilianisation programme can be advanced in the shorter term, both in the context of the Civilianisation Report and otherwise.  As the Deputy can see, considerable progress has been made to date and I will continue to drive this civilianisation process forward.</P>
        <P>I should mention that I am in receipt of two reports, one from the Hayes Advisory Group, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, the other from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, both of which make a number of recommendations in relation to the civilianisation of senior corporate management positions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will be announcing further details of these reports later today and they will also be laid before both Houses within the hour, for the benefit of Members.  I look forward to discussing the proposals contained in the reports with the Garda Commissioner over the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 148 together.</P>
        <P>In my reply to Question 109 of 2 November, 2006, I noted that the circumstances under which a death is reported to the relevant coroner falls within the jurisdiction of that coroner, being a quasi judicial authority charged with the independent investigation of death.  A coroner has the entitlement, under section 18 of the 1962 Coroners Act, to require that certain information in regard to certain types of deaths be provided.  It is a matter for the coroner to determine what information regarding a death he or she requires in order to carry out his function.  I have no role in this process.</P>
        <P>My understanding is that there has been contact between the Health Service Executive and the Dublin City Coroner&rsquo;s office on the specific matter raised by the Deputies.  I take it that it is in this context that the Dublin City Coroner has requested such information from hospitals within his jurisdiction with regard to the concerns in ensuring proper death certification where MRSA may be involved.</P>
        <P>Again, I understand that other coroners, either formally or informally may also have requested or are informed of such information from hospitals within their jurisdiction so as to ensure that the most appropriate information is conveyed in the death certificate.</P>
        <P>As indicated in the Government&rsquo;s Legislative Programme published on 26 September, 2006, the Coroners Bill is in the course of being drafted with a view to publication later in the year.  My proposals for a Bill to comprehensively reform the legislation relating to coroners and the organisation of the coroner service are available on my Department&rsquo;s website having been approved by the Government for drafting.  The new legislation will radically overhaul and reform the coroner service.  It will provide for a modernisation of the death investigation, post-mortem and inquest procedures so as to ensure a better service to society in general, and to the relatives of the deceased in particular, than is currently possible under the 1962 Coroners Act.</P>
        <P>There are two critical elements involved in the reform of the service which will be reflected in the new legislation. These are:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Development of optimum structures and administration for a modern coroner service and</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Widening the scope of the inquest.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Bill gives effect to the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on the Review of the Coroner Service and it takes into account <Col N="1841"/>relevant jurisprudence of our courts and the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
        <P>Finally, I would like to refer the Deputies to the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s comprehensive reply to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s Parliamentary Question of 1 November, 2006 (No. 35573/06) concerning MRSA.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there have been seven proceedings commenced relating to fireworks offences under the Explosives Act 1875, as amended by Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which came into effect on 1 August, 2006.</P>
        <P>Under Operation Tombola there have been 64 seizures of fireworks recorded for the period September to October, 2006, with an estimated value of &euro;113,511.  Figures provided are provisional, operational and liable to change.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that to date no vehicles used for the transportation of fireworks have been seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Operation Tombola, the annual Garda operation to combat the  illegal sale of fireworks, was launched in September this year.  Under this Operation each Assistant Commissioner in conjunction with his or her senior management team, puts initiatives in place, based on information and intelligence available, in each Garda Division to prevent and detect the sale and organised importation of fireworks, particularly in the lead up to Halloween.  All operational Garda&iacute;, together with dedicated resources specifically deployed for this Operation, are tasked with preventing and detecting such offences.</P>
        <P>I am confident that with the introduction of the new offences and new penalties the Garda operations will be even more successful in combating the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>

	<P>Following an open tender competition I have accepted the highest offer for the site of 6.33 acres at Shanganagh Castle.The proceeds from the sale of this site in addition to approximately 21 acres previously disposed of to Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council will meet in full the cost of the site at Thornton Hall.  This, contrary to what the Deputy is suggesting, represents excellent value for the State. The sale of the 21 acres to the Council was concluded for a consideration of &euro;9M, a fraction of its market value &mdash; on the basis that it would be utilised by the Council for the provision of social and affordable housing.</P>
        <P>At the time of the sale of the 21 acres in 2003 Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council expressly stated that it had no interest in the remaining 6.33 acres including Shanganagh Castle a protected structure.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 123 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, Athlone and Mullingar are two of 17 areas set to receive a Garda CCTV system under the Garda CCTV Programme.   The Garda authorities are currently finalising a detailed Request for Tender (RFT) for the outsourced service provision of 14 of these Garda CCTV systems in the following towns: Athlone, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.  The locations are listed in alphabetical order.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated previously, I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.  Garda Management and my Department are currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems, including Athlone and Mullingar. <Col N="1843"/>This will be the subject of a &ldquo;peer review&rdquo; process organised by the Department of Finance.  Following the successful conclusion of this review it is intended to issue the Request for Tender.</P>
        <P>I  wish to inform the Deputy that, on 13 October 2006, the Garda authorities published a request for tender document (RFT) for the installation of three Garda CCTV Systems in Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Tullamore on the Government&rsquo;s procurement website <i>etenders.gov.ie</i>. The closing date for receipt of tenders is 22 November 2006.</P>
        <P>Under this tender process the Garda authorities propose, as a pilot project, to seek proposals which use wireless CCTV technology for the installation of these three CCTV systems.  This innovative technology will allow CCTV cameras to be redeployed as necessary to meet changing policing requirements.</P>
        <P>The emphasis in this project is on speed of implementation and contractors will be required to complete the deployment of these CCTV systems before the end of March 2007.   The implementation of these Garda CCTV systems will provide a strong deterrent to anti-social behaviour and an excellent tool for Garda&iacute; in Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Tullamore in their fight against street crime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that while there has been a slight increase in the quantity of freebase or crack cocaine seized in this jurisdiction over the past two years, this still represents a small proportion of the total number of cocaine seizures recorded annually.</P>
        <P>However, the Garda authorities also inform me that most of the recorded seizures of freebase cocaine, have to date been made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s North Central Division of the Dublin Metropolitan Region.</P>
        <P>This, of course, is a matter of concern and the Garda authorities have taken a number of measures to address the problem. The Garda National Drugs Unit and local drug units conduct intelligence-driven operations to target individuals suspected of involvement in the distribution of freebase cocaine. Drug units and community policing personnel are engaged in intelligence gathering on individuals and groups suspected of involvement in the sale and distribution of the drug. There is also targeted patrolling by uniform <Col N="1844"/>and plain-clothes personnel of problem areas in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in such activity.</P>
        <P>In addition. I am informed by the Garda authorities, that during 2006 the Garda National Drugs Unit, in conjunction with local Garda management in the DMR North Central Division, commenced an on-going investigation into the alleged distribution of freebase cocaine within that Division.  This initiative has resulted in the arrest of 15 persons for offences contrary to section 15, Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977/84 &mdash; possession of drugs with intent to supply.  Freebase cocaine has been confirmed as one of a number of drugs seized during this initiative to date.</P>
        <P>In terms of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to tackle drug misuse, the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 addresses the problem across a number of pillars &mdash; supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research and implementation of the strategy across a range of Government Departments and agencies is coordinated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>The Government is aware of the increased prevalence of cocaine usage in recent times and efforts to tackle it are broadly based to include measures aimed at both supply and demand reduction, including awareness initiatives.</P>
        <P>The national strategy specifies a number of supply reduction targets for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of all drug seizures and the Garda&iacute; have achieved considerable successes in relation to these targets to date.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that their strategies for dealing with drug offences are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs, including all forms of cocaine.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities advise that these strategies continue to result in operational successes, including successes against cocaine trafficking. The trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs, including hydrochloric and freebase cocaine, at local, national and international levels is constantly monitored by the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Criminal Justice Act 2006, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will further enhance the powers of the Garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of offences, including drug offences.</P>

	<P>Following the establishment of the Commission of Investigation set up to look into the Dean Lyons case,  I established an Expert Group to report to me on the adequacy of Garda training, protocols, regulations and procedures, in assessing the fitness of persons to be interviewed and on the recording of any bona fide reservations of an individual member of a Garda investigation team as to the truthfulness or accuracy of self-incriminating statements.</P>
        <P>The work of the Expert Group is still ongoing.  As I understand it, they have been making good progress in dealing with what is a complex and contentious brief. They have the opportunity of taking the Report of the Dean Lyons Commission of Investigation into account as well as similar type considerations which have arisen before the Morris Tribunal.</P>
        <P>I am hopeful that the Group will be in a position to report to me in early 2007.  As I have promised previously, I intend to publish the Report.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 25 October, 2006 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the assistance of a wide range of government and non-government agencies, dealt effectively with a major incident involving a serious threat to life and property, which resulted in a group of people being left homeless in the early hours of the morning.</P>
        <P>I understand that an offer was accepted from the Prison Service to accommodate these temporarily homeless people within the Mountjoy Prison complex, at short notice, and on an emergency basis.  Dublin Bus and staff at the Mater Hospital also greatly facilitated this immediate solution.  I am also informed that the relevant authorities resumed responsibility for the group&rsquo;s welfare the next day.</P>

I have similar concerns about the role of MI6 in the south . . .&rsquo;  In response to Parliamentary Question No. 168 of 25 October, 2006, I indicated that it was not clear what, if any, allegations were being made and, accordingly, that I was not in a position to make any substantive response.

        <P>The 1875 Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 and, on 1st August, I signed an order bringing all sections of the Act relating to fireworks into immediate effect.

	<P>Funding of &euro;110,000 in respect of a National Missing Persons Helpline made available by my Department in 2002 and 2003 was channelled through the Victim Support organisation, and was in addition to the ongoing funding that  organisation received for the provision of services to victims of crime. This funding of &euro;110,000 was provided subject to the conditions that no funding beyond the year 2003 should be implied, and audited accounts should be provided to my Department on a calendar year basis.  To date no audited accounts have been received in my Department.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2003, and as a matter of good practice in the handling of public money, my Department commissioned a review of the Helpline from the Department of Social Sciences, Dublin Institute of Technology, which recorded the number of phone calls to the Helpline up to that time in the region of 100.</P>
        <P>In March 2005, I decided that continued funding of the Victim Support organisation could no longer be justified due to serious concerns in relation to governance, accountability for public funds and poor service levels, after a lengthy period of instability within the organisation.   I understand that Victim Support closed down its headquarters operation during 2005 and that a number of staff were made redundant, including the person employed to operate the Missing Persons Helpline.  My Department had no role in the decision of Victim Support  to make a number of its staff redundant, other than to insist that statutory requirements (notice, holiday pay, etc.) be met and that the interests of the staff be protected.</P>
        <P>Also in March 2005, I established a new Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures.  The Commission is entirely independent in its decision making and examines each application on its merits.  The <Col N="1849"/>Commission received an application from Missing in Ireland Support Service for &euro;71,600 to establish, staff and operate a Helpline for missing persons.  After careful consideration of the application the Commission decided to offer funding of &euro;25,000.  However, this offer was rejected by the Missing in Ireland Support Service.  It should be borne in mind in this context that the Commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime, and that, while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most are not.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuously monitoring international developments in relation to missing persons in order to ensure that best practice is followed. If their professional judgement is that some change in the existing legislation, protocols or structures would be of assistance in improving investigations, this would be considered by me.</P>
        <P>The disappearance of any person is traumatic for their family and friends, and for this reason I am anxious to assist them in any way I can.  I am of the view that a Helpline for this purpose is best set up on an independent basis and by a non-official, voluntary organisation.</P>
        <P>A proposal for funding has been received in my Department from the Missing In Ireland Support Service to restore the National Missing Persons Helpline and officials are currently examining the proposal.</P>

	<P>The provisional headline crime statistics for the third quarter of 2006 show a decrease of 1.6% for the quarter compared with the same quarter in 2005.  These statistics are the first crime statistics to be published by the Central Statistics Office following my decision that new arrangements should be put in place.</P>
        <P>As I have consistently done since I directed the quarterly publication of the figures in 2003, I once again emphasise that care must be taken in interpreting the statistics, especially when considering short term fluctuations and extrapolating trends over short periods.</P>
        <P>Of particular note in the figures published for the third quarter are the decreases in murder and manslaughter offences (overall decrease of 6%) and sexual offences (overall decrease of 9%). There have also been significant decreases in the range of robbery and theft offences, including decreases of 43% in robberies of cash and goods in transit and of 24% in theft from the person.</P><Col N="1850"/>
        <P>The largest percentage increases have been in low volume crimes, such as aggravated sexual assault and false imprisonment, where a small increase in the number of crimes will result in a large percentage increase.</P>
        <P>I welcome the large increase of 183% in the detection of the offences of cultivation, manufacture and importation of drugs, which is due to professional and skilful police work by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as the increased resources available.</P>
        <P>Looking at longer term crime trends, the level of headline crime in 2005 was lower than that in 2002 by 4.4%.  Furthermore, in 1995, when we had a population of almost 3.6 million, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population &mdash; 15% less crimes per 1,000 of the population.  By way of comparison, during 1995 and 1996, the last full two years of the Rainbow Government, when the population was 600,000 lower than it is at present, there were 29 and 28 crimes per 1,000 population in each of the two years.</P>

	<P>As the deputy will be aware, the main purpose of this Bill is to provide specific arrangements for voting by prisoners by way of postal voting.  In Ireland, there is no legal prohibition on voting by prisoners, once they meet the standard qualifying criteria under electoral law which apply on a general basis. But, while a person in legal custody may be registered as an elector, under section 11(5) of the Electoral Act 1992 they are deemed to be ordinarily resident in the place where they would have been <Col N="1852"/>residing but for their detention and there is no specific mechanism to enable prisoners to exercise the franchise.  The Bill will modernise existing electoral law in this area and provide a practical framework for prisoners to vote.  It will bring certainty to Ireland&rsquo;s position in meeting fully our obligations under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Bill, relevant officials will be appointed in each prison who will be responsible for ensuring that prisoners who are eligible and wish to vote will be facilitated in exercising that right.  Officials of the Irish Prison Service are preparing draft operating procedures which will allow the implementation of this important piece of legislation, when enacted.  Of course, in implementing this legislation, it will be important to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, providing for and facilitating as much as possible the prisoner&rsquo;s right to vote and, on the other, the need to maintain an orderly and appropriate regime within our prisons.</P>
        <P>It is important that prisoners will be fully aware of their entitlement to vote and there are various mechanisms available in this regard.  I understand that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will arrange for the publication and distribution of appropriate literature concerning the new arrangements for prisoner voting.  It should be possible to arrange for posters to be devised advertising the new arrangements within the prisons. Leaflets can also be developed specifically for prisoners in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for distribution by the Prison Service.  In terms of information and assistance, section 5 of the Bill already requires local authorities to give public notice of the availability of prisoner postal voting.  Application forms have to be made available by the local authority, including in every prison, and these forms will contain appropriate explanatory information on what needs to be done. In addition, prisoners receive information on their arrival in prison and this provides a good opportunity for relevant details of voting rights to be given to the prisoner. Library facilities in prison will also be an important focal point for information on voting entitlements.</P>
        <P>Prisoner access to the media and coverage of political and electoral matters therein will, of itself, serve to raise awareness among prisoners of the postal voting arrangements. TV sets are installed in all cells in prison; in open centres, there are communal viewing areas. Prisoners are supplied with small radios in prisons and, in many cases, bring in their own units.  They also have access to a range of daily newspapers and weekly publications, in addition to what they might receive through the post. Prisoners have access to visits and a number of phone calls per week <Col N="1853"/>which will facilitate this process. I would also look to prisoners&rsquo; families, as well as to organisations representing prisoners, to play their part in helping to publicise the new arrangements and facilitating take-up.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be collating data on the numbers of prisoners taking up postal voting facilities. This will provide a good basis for monitoring progress with the new arrangements provided for under the Bill.</P>

        <P>JLOs are responsible for implementing the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme, which provides an opportunity to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity. The Programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age, who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident, may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for a change to the age of criminal responsibility and for the introduction of behaviour orders for children.  Officials of the Irish Youth Justice Service in my Department have begun consultations with the Garda authorities on the effect and resource implications which these changes will have on the work of the Juvenile Diversion Programme.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Juvenile Diversion Programme, there are also 74 Garda Youth Diversion Projects nationwide.  Garda Youth Diversion Projects aim to bring about the conditions whereby <Col N="1854"/>the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature. These projects cater for approximately 2,500 participants per annum and are particularly targeted at 10-18 year old &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youths. The allocation of funding for the 64 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (along with 7 Local Drug Task Force Projects) in 2006 is just over &euro;6.6 million, which is an increase of &euro;1.2 million on 2005.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.  Recently, I announced the establishment of ten new projects located in Blanchardstown, Birr, Carlow, Castlebar, Cavan, Clondalkin, Limerick, Tallaght and Tralee (two projects). The appointment of additional Juvenile Liaison Officers for these projects is under consideration.</P>

	<P>In order to further the proposals I made in my recent speech in Limerick concerning the issue of rebalancing criminal justice I have appointed an expert review group to examine and review certain aspects of the criminal law. The terms of reference of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group are to examine issues affecting:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the right to silence;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />allowing character evidence of an accused;</P>

      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />modifying the rule in relation to hearsay evidence;</P>
        <P FLI="0">and any other proposals regarding criminal law, criminal evidence and criminal procedure that <Col N="1855"/>may come to the attention of the Review Group in the course of their examination of those issues. I have requested the Review Group to report back to me by 1 March 2007.</P>
        <P>The members of the Review Group are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Dr. Gerard Hogan, S.C, Law School, Trinity College, Dublin, Chairperson;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Professor David Gwynn Morgan, U.C.C;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Mr. Richard Humphreys, Barrister-at-Law;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Ms Nora Owen, Chairperson of the Justice Group of the Institute of European Affairs and Member of the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime;</P>

        <P FLI="0">I consider that the members represent a solid blend of legal, academic and practical expertise and I am confident that their work will be a valuable contribution to what I described in my Limerick speech as a need to sometimes consider and review values and standards in our criminal justice system to ensure that the scales of justice remain balanced and are not tilted unfairly in one direction.</P>
        <P>In relation to the involvement of the Law Reform Commission I understand that the Review  Group is seeking submissions from interested parties and members of the public to assist it with its deliberations. Advertisements inviting such submissions by 5 January 2007 have already appeared in the press. This approach will afford the Commission an opportunity to present its views should it wish to do so.</P>

	<P>The Privacy Bill which was published on 4 July 2006 creates an offence to be known as the tort of invasion of privacy, for a person wilfully and without lawful authority to violate the privacy of another individual.</P>
        <P>Where material obtained from closed circuit television or other monitoring equipment may be used in an inappropriate manner then the aggrieved person will have an accessible  remedy in law.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Bill contains a defence (in Section 5) in a privacy action for a defendant to prove that the act in respect of which a privacy action is being brought consisted of the installation or operation, in good faith, of a closed circuit television system or other surveillance system for a purpose authorised by law, or for the purpose of detecting or preventing the commission of an offence or the protection of persons or property.</P>
        <P>The Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003 apply to personal data recorded through the operation of the CCTV systems or other monitoring equipment.</P>
        <P>With regard to the operation of CCTV systems in public places for the purposes of crime prevention by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and community based groups, section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides a legislative basis for the operation of such CCTV systems. It does not apply to persons operating CCTV cameras on their premises for the purposes of protecting persons or property on the premises or environs.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 in respect of which the Government gave approval to draft a general scheme in July of this year, I am considering the possible extension of the definition of harassment as set out in section 10 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 to include a new offence, on the basis of the evidence found, of video recording or photographing of persons without their knowledge in any place that a person could reasonably expect privacy.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commissioners were appointed by the President on the 10th February 2006, following nomination by the Government and recommendations by both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Commission is in a preparatory <Col N="1857"/>stage at present. I understand that the initial work of the Commission has involved study visits to their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK and initial meetings with the various stakeholders involved in the Garda complaints system, such as Garda management, the Garda representative bodies and officials of my Department.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that due to a delay in some Garda Stations making their returns to Garda Headquarters, a conclusive figure of weapons surrendered under the recent Amnesty will not be available until later this week.  However, to date 522 firearms and 82 knives, which were surrendered under the Amnesty, have been returned to Garda Headquarters.</P>
        <P>A successful national awareness campaign was undertaken to promote the Amnesty.  The campaign included advertisements in the national and provincial newspapers and specialist publications together with an extensive high visibility billboard campaign.  In addition 20,000 information leaflets were printed and circulated through Garda Stations throughout the country and a website was launched to provide extensive on-line information in relation to the Amnesty.</P>
        <P>I want to emphasis that I was never of the view that serious criminals were going to come into police stations and hand over their firearms.  However, I was satisfied there were people with guns and offensive weapons in their possession who might find it embarrassing to come forward or to admit that they had them in the house and that the amnesty would afford them an opportunity to surrender such weapons safely.  This indeed has proven to be the case.</P>
        <P>The Weapons Amnesty has afforded people an opportunity to hand in illegally held firearms and other offensive weapons before the introduction of new stringent sentences for firearms offences.  From here on, persons found in possession of illegal weapons will face very harsh penalties with the introduction of the mandatory minimum prison sentences provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, 2006.  From the 1st November, minimum mandatory sentences of up to 10 years, for a range of firearms offences, have come into operation.  Only in exceptional and specific circumstances, and in the case of a first offence only, can the court exercise discretion to impose less than the minimum sentence.  I am satisfied that the Amnesty has been a success and fully achieved its aims.</P>

	<P>The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 contains provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour. The Act empowers a senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner. In relation to children aged 12 to 18 years, specially tailored provisions, fully integrated into the Children Act 2001, provide for a number of steps. These culminate in court orders for those engaged in anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>The relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 will be commenced following consultations between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Section 1(3) of the Act makes specific provision to this effect. The purpose of this is to ensure that these provisions will only be commenced after the Commissioner has had the opportunity to make the necessary internal arrangements to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.  Work is underway in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to put these arrangements in place.</P>
        <P>I want to emphasise again that separate provision is being made in relation to young people. <Col N="1860"/> The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act, 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There has to be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme. Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the Courts.</P>
        <P>In addition to new administrative procedures within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, behaviour orders require changes to the existing Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme provided for in the Children Act, 2001.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 216 together.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil commenced in the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) on 17 May, 2005.  It is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The Operation remains in place and is on-going in the DMR.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil was also extended nationwide during 2006 and consists of a series of special operations, proposed by each Regional Assistant Commissioner, which are designed to focus on areas where there is a high incidence of crime.</P>
        <P>The Operation outside the DMR is significantly different from that in the DMR, in that initiatives have a short time-focus and are designed to address the particular needs of specific areas. A number of operations have been completed, while further operations are on-going. The methodologies utilised in doing this vary <Col N="1861"/>from area to area and from time to time, commensurate with the assessed need. For these reasons there is no comparable system in place for the systematic collation of statistical data in these Garda Regions.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the information requested in respect of the number of persons charged is not readily available as some of the incidents resulting in arrest are the subject of ongoing investigation. The information could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to examine each individual incident and resultant arrest or arrests.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in recorded crime in the target crime areas under the operation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil will continue to be funded to the extent and as long as the Commissioner considers that it is necessary to do so and it is fulfilling its objectives.  The tables show the successes of Operation Anvil up to 31 October 2006.</P>

	<P>The Probation Service has been re-vitalised over the last  twelve months and the process of change is continuing apace. I can advise the Deputy  that following an open competition a new Director was appointed to the Probation Service in September, 2005. To support the Director and strengthen the management of the Service a new senior management structure for the Service has now been put in place comprising three Deputy Directors and 2 Assistant Deputy Directors.    The services of an Accountant have been engaged in recent weeks and further work is ongoing to enhance the IT expertise available to the Service.</P>
        <P>The Probation Service Strategy Statement and Work Plan of Strategic Actions 2006-2007, which set out the strategic goals of the Service for the period, was launched by me on the 26 June, 2006.  This launch was also used to rebrand the Service.</P>
        <P>A Young Persons Probation Division (YPP) has been established within the Probation Service.  The YPP Interim Strategy 2006-2007 is due to be launched later this month by my colleague, Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D., Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that the Service has received increased resources including 30 additional staff <Col N="1863"/>as well as extra financial resources in recent years.  The need for additional resources, in the context of the 2006 Criminal Justice Act, will be kept under review.</P>

	<P>My Department has considered the issue of access to employment opportunities for older people in the preparation of Employment Equality legislation, in equality proofing initiatives and in the context of social partnership agreements.</P>
        <P>The Employment Equality Acts are framed on the basis of a general principle that there ought to be no discrimination on the grounds of age, where the employee is willing to undertake or continue to undertake, or will accept or continue to accept, the conditions under which the duties are required to be performed, and is fully competent and available to undertake, and fully capable of undertaking the duties attached to the position. There are certain exceptions provided in cases such as the Emergency services and Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The provisions in the Employment Equality Act 1998 for prohibiting discrimination on the ground of age were strengthened in the Equality Act 2004, which gave effect to the EU Anti-dis<Col N="1864"/>crimination Employment Directive. The Equality Act 2004 amended the exclusion in the 1998 Act from discrimination on the age ground of persons less than 18 years or 65 years or over. No upper age threshold is provided for; however, compulsory retirement ages may continue to be set.</P>
        <P>The Working Group on Equality Proofing is established under the aegis of my Department and is Chaired by the Equality Authority and Diversity &amp; Equality Law Division of my Department. The Working Group continues to work towards developing a system for the proofing of policies and services in the public sector in order to avoid unanticipated negative impact on any of the groups protected under equality legislation (including older people) and to ensure policy coherence and best use of resources.</P>
        <P>My Department has participated in the development of the new framework social partnership agreement, &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;, which includes priority actions for the promotion of education and employment opportunities for older people.  The Government will continue to encourage and to facilitate an increase in work force participation by older people.</P>

	<P>In August 2005, I received a submission from the Garda Commissioner on the resourcing requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The submission was based on the Commissioner&rsquo;s analysis of the policing challenges facing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the medium and longer term, including the implications of demographic change, the need to continue to combat crime and terrorist threats, and the requirements for enhanced enforcement of road traffic law and immigration control.  In the submission, the Commissioner proposed the future expansion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000 full time members.  He also proposed the expansion of the Garda overtime budget, the creation of a Garda Reserve and additional civilian support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On these last three issues, strong action has been taken.  The 2006 Garda overtime budget allocation has risen by &euro;22.4 million to &euro;83.5 million, an increase of 36.6% over the original allocation of &euro;61.1m in 2005.  The Garda Reserve has been established, with the first group of recruits expected to complete their training next month.  Significant progress is being made on providing additional civilian support for An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.</P><Col N="1865"/>
        <P>On the issue of an increase in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000, the priority has been the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137. This has involved a major redevelopment of the facilities at the Garda College, almost doubling its student capacity.</P>
        <P>I am now giving careful consideration to the case for a continuation of the current intensive recruitment drive beyond the target of 14,000, and I will shortly bring new proposals to Government in this regard.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the general increase in the cost of keeping prisoners in jail and particularly the fact that the cost of keeping a prisoner in Portlaoise is now close to a quarter of a million euro per year; his plans to examine ways of reducing such costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The average cost of keeping an offender in custody is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders in those institutions.  These costs include certain items which are fixed no matter what the number of offenders in custody, e.g. utilities, staff salaries, etc.  It also reallocates the cost of central services, e.g. H.Q., Prison Service Training Centre, I.T., etc. to each prison institution.</P>
        <P>The general increase in the cost of keeping an offender in 2005 relates to a number of specific areas:</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) pay increases in line with National Wage Agreements,</P>
       <P LI="1">(ii) an increase in maintenance costs associated with the higher costs of maintaining older prison building stock,</P>
        <P LI="1">(iii) higher than expected increase in the costs of utilities, and</P>
       <P LI="1">(iv) the provision of additional teaching staff.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The relatively high costs of keeping a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison arises primarily because of the unique nature of the prisoners held there and the consequent security considerations which require a higher staff to prisoner ratio.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will of course be aware of my determination to reduce costs in the Prison Service.  For example, following protracted nego<Col N="1866"/>tiations with the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association, agreement was reached last year on a major programme of change which has since been rolled out across the Service.   This agreement involves radical change, including new attendance arrangements which involve the elimination of overtime working.</P>

        <P>In tackling the problem of drug trafficking, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to record significant operational successes, directly attributable to increased law enforcement through intelligence-driven operations at national, regional, divisional and district levels, coordinated by the Garda <Col N="1868"/>National Drugs Unit in conjunction with other specialist Garda Units and local Garda Management, whereby criminals believed to be involved in the sale, distribution and importation of illegal drugs are identified and actively targeted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>On an international level the Garda National Drugs Unit continually strives to increase the level of cooperation, through international law-enforcement agencies, Interpol and Europol. Garda liaison Officers are currently in place in the UK, Spain, The Netherlands, and at Europol and Interpol.</P>
        <P>Ongoing cooperation through these arrangements continue to result in a number of significant drug seizures and arrests such as the recent seizure of approximately 50kgs of heroin, believed to be destined for Dublin, at a private airfield in Belgium. This police operation which was initiated in Ireland, developed into a joint operation with the Belgian and Dutch police.</P>
        <P>In terms of the Government&rsquo;s position in relation to these issues, I would refer the Deputy to my reply earlier today to Priority Question No. 82.</P>

        <Quest> when he intends to implement section 16 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 that provides that a video recording of any evidence given by a person under 17 years of age in respect of sexual or violent offences shall be admissible as trial evidence; the reason for the long delay in bringing this provision into effect, having particular regard to reduce the potential stress for young persons giving evidence in cases involving sexual offences; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 16 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, as amended, makes provision for the video recording of any evidence given, in relation to a sexual offence or an act involving violence, by a person under 17 years of age through a live television link in proceedings relating to indictable offences.  The relevant subsection &mdash; (1)(a) &mdash; was commenced in 1993.  It will be noted that this subsection covers persons under 14 years of age also.</P>
        <P>Section 16 also makes provision &mdash; in subsection (1)(b) &mdash; for the video recording of a statement made by a person under 14 years of age (in respect of whom a sexual offence or an offence involving violence is alleged to have been committed) during an interview with a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other person who is competent for the purpose.  It provides that such a video recording shall be admissible at a trial as evidence, provided that the person whose state<Col N="1869"/>ment was video recorded is available at the trial for cross examination.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform established a committee in 1998 to draw up guidelines for persons involved in video recording interviews with a complainant (aged under 14 years of age or with an intellectual disability) in relation to a sexual and/or violent offence during an interview with a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other person competent for the purpose, as he considered that it would benefit complainants and interviewers if good practice guidelines on the conduct and recording of such interviews were made available.  This committee subsequently submitted in 2003 advisory Good Practice Guidelines with related recommendations. The Guidelines cover a number of areas.  In addition, the committee made a number of recommendations, including recommendations that:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />there should be sufficient suitable facilities available for video recording evidential interviews;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />there should be a joint national programme in place for training interviewers, which should be regularly reviewed.  In tandem with this, there will be a need for a national training programme for all professionals who are likely to have reference to the Guidelines.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to assure the Deputy that I attach the highest importance to the setting up of these facilities.  Officials from my Department are actively working on setting up these facilities in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the Office of Public Works and the Health Service Executive.  My Department plans to have a network of suitable facilities to video record evidential interviews established at a number of locations throughout the country early in 2007. The Probation Service has identified suitable accommodation in a number of its premises. Arrangements are being made to view this week a similar facility in this jurisdiction which is used for therapeutic purposes and also a facility in Northern Ireland, and receive briefing on training and advice on other relevant service issues such as equipment and fitting out.  A specification for the facilities will be drawn up soon after, on the basis of which suitable accommodation will be identified. Work will then commence on fitting out and equipping the facilities.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is arranging for the training of a number of selected officers to enable them to conduct such interviews in accordance with good practice. It is expected that this training will be completed in January.</P>

	<P>In the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005, I made detailed provisions for the making of Disciplinary Regulations for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>In its report earlier this year, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act Implementation Group, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, acknowledged the requirement for changes to the Garda disciplinary regulations to coincide with the coming <Col N="1871"/>into operation of the Garda Ombudsman Commission. The Group was strongly of the view that the opportunity should be taken for a comprehensive revision of the Garda disciplinary framework so as to bring it into line with modern practice in human resource management.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, on 19th of May 2006, the Government statement regarding Reports of the Morris Tribunal acknowledged and accepted the views of the Tribunal that the current disciplinary regulations need to be replaced by a new less complex approach which will be swift and fair with a simple appeal process.</P>
        <P>On 17 August, on publication of the 3rd, 4th and 5th reports of the Morris Tribunal, I  published new draft Garda Discipline Regulations which were drawn up in consultation with the Garda Commissioner. These draft regulations take account of the recommendations of the Morris Tribunal, follow well-established principles in the public sector and beyond, and are significantly more streamlined than existing Garda Discipline Regulations. The new draft regulations have been put into the Garda Conciliation Council for discussion with the Garda representative associations and, in recognition of the fundamental changes now proposed, I have made available additional time beyond the original target date of the Summer recess.  I do expect, however, those discussions to be concluded promptly and effectively, and I will bring final proposals to Government for approval in the near future.</P>

        <Quest> the number of cases of murder in which firearms were used in respect of each year from 1998 to date in 2006; the number of such cases in which prosecutions for murder were initiated; the number of such cases where convictions were secured; if he is satisfied with the level of detection and conviction in such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36271/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the table shows the number of murder offences recorded, detected, proceedings commenced and convictions, where a firearm was used, for the years 1998 to 2005 and in 2006 up to 2 November.</P>
        <P>All killings regardless of the circumstances involved are the subject of a rigorous investigation by the Garda authorities.  The identification of the motive and the evidence available in its support are key elements of the investigation and prosecution process.  I am informed that Garda management analyses available intelligence and selects for specific individuals involved in serious criminal activity, particularly <Col N="1872"/>gun-related crime.  Intelligence-led operations against such individuals are used by Garda management to combat this type of criminal activity on an ongoing basis.  This involves the strategic deployment of both local and specialised Garda operation units to counter such activities.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil, which commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in May, 2005 and was subsequently extended nationwide at my request, has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in recorded crime in the target crime areas under the operation.  I am pleased to note that the number of offences of discharging a firearm was stable in the third quarter of this year.  I believe that Operation Anvil has contributed significantly to this situation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following the completion of the weapons amnesty on 31 October, the mandatory minimum sentences in relation to possession of firearms came into effect on 1 November. The penalties available to the courts have now been greatly strengthened and stringent penalties now apply:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Possession of firearms with intent to endanger life &mdash; maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Use of firearms to resist arrest or aid escape &mdash; maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Possession of firearm while hijacking a  vehicle &mdash; maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Possession of firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances &mdash; maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Carrying firearm with criminal intent &mdash; maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment; and</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Altering a firearm &mdash; maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment.</P><Col N="1873"/>
        <P FLI="0">The new law specifies that the courts may exercise discretion to impose less than the minimum sentence only where it is satisfied that there are exceptional and specific circumstances for doing so.  In addition, it may exercise its discretion only in the case of a first offence.  Where a person charged with any of the above offences has been previously convicted of any such offence, then the <Col N="1874"/>court has no discretion and must impose at least the mandatory minimum sentence.  I am confident that these stringent new provisions, combined with the continuing efforts of the Garda&iacute; in Operation Anvil, will go a long way to ensuring that those found in possession of firearms will pay a very serious price for their crimes.</P><Col N="1873"/>

	<P>The Annual Report for 2005 of the Comptroller and Auditor General includes a chapter on the acquisition of a Site for Prison Development.   The Department of Finance granted sanction for the acquisition of the site on the condition that procurement guidelines were followed.  Contrary to the implications of the Deputy&rsquo;s question all the relevant procurement guidelines were followed by my Department in acquiring the Thornton site.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did raise a question  with respect to the engagement of advisors by the Office of Public Works but that does not affect the sanction for the acquisition of Thornton.</P><Col N="1874"/>
        <P>I am satisfied that the site selected is an excellent site and will allow Mountjoy to be replaced by a modern high standard prison with conditions and facilities beyond anything that could be contemplated in Mountjoy.</P>
        <P>At its recent hearings on the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2005 there was an overwhelming consensus among the members of the Public Accounts Committee that it would have been wrong to buy a prison site by a secret deal or process. Accordingly, there was no agreement by the members that any premium on the sale value of the site arising from the open process of purchase adopted by the Committee should have been avoided by purchasing the site on a secret or confidential basis.</P>

	<P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that training and education programmes in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution are almost non-existent.  On the contrary, there are a number of workshops currently in operation &mdash; covering Woodwork and Joinery; Computer Training; Industrial Cleaning and Industrial Skills.  A Metal Workshop is also due to open soon.  Some young persons also work in the kitchen and laundry <Col N="1875"/>areas &mdash; with others engaged in painting, general cleaning and horticultural work around the Institution.</P>
        <P>Educational classes and courses are provided by a team of twelve full time teachers in the Education Unit.  Courses offered cover a wide range of subjects &mdash; including English, Maths, Computers, Art, Music, Home Economics and Guidance.  St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution also has a structured literacy programme.</P>
        <P>All young persons are interviewed for both Work/Training and the Education Unit and offered places in one or other of these activities.  In addition, all have access to library facilities and a fully fitted out gymnasium.</P>
        <P>I should also add that St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution has, in recent years, introduced important new programmes for the rehabilitation of young persons including a drug-free wing and a positive sentence management programme.  It also offers a range of in-house programmes in the areas of addiction awareness, treatment and counselling (i.e., drugs, alcohol).</P>
        <P>Furthermore, St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution takes a proactive approach in developing and maintaining links with a wide range of community and voluntary bodies.  There are about 50 such bodies and groups with which the Institution engages and interacts either on an in-reach basis or with a view to securing post-release placements for young persons from St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ongoing implementation of the new working arrangements agreed with the Prison Officers Association in the Proposal for Organisational Change should enhance prisoner regimes in the years ahead, particularly in terms of improving availability and facilities, and making the most of out-of-cell time for all persons in custody &mdash; including young persons in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware of my plans to close St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution as part of the redevelopment of the Mountjoy complex on the new site in Thornton Hall in North County Dublin. This major prison building programme will offer significant improvements in the areas of work, training, educational and medical services for inmates as well as predominantly single cell accommodation with proper in-cell sanitation facilities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 189 and 190 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has consulted with the Office of the Attorney General and with the Department of Finance about the implications of the judgment of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the case referred to by the Deputies.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, under EU law, indirect discrimination on the ground of sex, in issues relating to pay is unlawful. In such cases, indirect discrimination would be defined as  where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared with persons of the other sex, unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim, and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.</P>
        <P>The point at issue in the recent case under reference was: where the use by an employer of the criterion of length of service (an apparently neutral provision) as a determinant of pay has a disparate impact as between relevant male and female employees, does Article 141 of the EU Consolidated Treaties require the employer to provide special justification for recourse to that criterion?</P>
        <P>In 1989, in the judgment in Danfoss, the ECJ, after stating that it is not to be excluded, that recourse to the criterion of length of service may involve less advantageous treatment of women than of men, held that the employer does not have to provide special justification for recourse to that criterion. By adopting that position, the Court acknowledged that rewarding in particular <Col N="1878"/>experience acquired, which enables the worker to perform his/her duties better, constitutes a legitimate objective of pay policy.</P>
        <P>As a general rule, recourse to the criterion of length of service is appropriate to attain that objective. Length of service goes hand in hand with experience, and experience generally enables the worker to perform his/her duties better. The employer is therefore free to reward length of service without having to establish the importance it has in the performance of specific tasks entrusted to the employee.</P>
        <P>In the same judgment, the Court did not, however, exclude the possibility that there may be situations in which recourse to the criterion of length of service must be justified by the employer in detail.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case under reference the Court of Appeal of England and Wales was uncertain whether the case-law of the ECJ had departed from the finding in Danfoss that &lsquo;the employer does not have to provide special justification for recourse to the criterion of length of service&rsquo; and submitted the question for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 of the EC Treaty. The ECJ in their recent judgment found that Article 141 EC is to be interpreted as meaning that, where recourse to the criterion of length of service as a determinant of pay leads to disparities in pay, in respect of equal work or work of equal value, between the men and women included in the comparison</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the employer does not have to establish specifically that recourse to that criterion is appropriate to attain that objective as regards a particular job, unless the worker provides evidence capable of raising serious doubts in that regard, since, as a general rule, recourse to the criterion of length of service is appropriate to attain the legitimate objective of rewarding experience acquired which enables the worker to perform his/her duties better;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />there is no need to show that an individual worker has acquired experience during the relevant period which has enabled him/her to perform his/her duties better where a job classification system based on an evaluation of the work to be carried out is used in determining pay.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The ECJ characterised this judgment as containing only a clarification of the case-law in this field. It has, thus, clarified the meaning of Danfoss but confirmed that it remains good law and that, as a result, has confirmed, in principle, that the use of criterion of length of service is an appropriate means of attaining the legitimate objective of rewarding experience acquired which enables the worker to perform his/her duties better.  In general, the employer will not be required to prove that actual experience has been acquired.</P><Col N="1879"/>
        <P>Given that the judgment does not represent a significant change to existing case law, no change in Irish domestic law is required. The Government recognise that the gender pay gap, while narrowing, remains. It is committed to policy measures, to facilitate work-life balance, which enable parents to manage work and family responsibilities without breaching service, and thus maintaining pay scale progression.</P>

	<P>The provision of services to the Thornton Hall site to service the prison development has been the subject of detailed discussions between the relevant officials at Fingal County Council and the Irish Prison Service and its technical advisors.  Discussions have also been held with the various utilities including the Electricity Supply Board.  Arising from these discussions, agreement in principle has been reached with the Council for the servicing of the water and sewerage requirements along existing public roadways, i.e., the N2 and the R130.  It has, in addition, been agreed with the Electricity Supply Board that the required electricity supply will be sourced from existing lines adjacent to the site.</P><Col N="1880"/>

As such there is no requirement arising to provide additional roads to service the site.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that despite the high level of enforcement activity by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as evidenced by the number of arrests for drink driving over the October Bank Holiday week-end, there still exists a hardcore element in our society who persist in engaging in drink driving.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue this high level of enforcement activity, through the use of mandatory alcohol testing coupled with ongoing deployment of additional resources to the Garda Traffic Corps, in order to change driver behaviour and enforce compliance with road traffic legislation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to prioritise drink driving offences as one of the major causes of road traffic injuries and fatalities.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Authority, which is under the aegis of the Department of Transport and has responsibility in this area, is examining ways in which the level of compliance by motorists with the law and road safety can be increased and is preparing proposals in this regard for submission to the Minister for Transport.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 provides the legal basis for mandatory alcohol testing (MAT).  It confers a statutory power to administer a roadside breath test to a motorist stopped at a checkpoint without a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being required to form an opinion that the motorist has consumed alcohol, been involved in a collision or breached a provision of the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
        <P>Developments since the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing in July have been encouraging.  The number of road deaths in August was 17 &mdash; the lowest number for any month since November 1999.  This trend continued in September, when the number of deaths was 23, compared with 31 in 2005 and in October when the number of deaths was 32 compared with <Col N="1881"/>44 in 2005.  Up to and including the 2 November,  there were 315 deaths in 2006, 14 less than for the same period last year.</P>
        <P>The current strength of the Garda Traffic Corps stands at 745, with an additional 60 members to be allocated during the remainder of 2006 and is well on target to achieve the target strength of 805 members at the end of 2006.</P>

	<P>My Department approved funding in 2004 to the Institute of Criminology at UCD for research on sentencing under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998.  The research report was recently received by my Department and its findings are being considered by the Internet Advisory Board.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in all cases where criminal activity is alleged the matter is fully investigated and a file is prepared for the Director of Public Prosecution, who adjudicates on what action, if any, is to be taken.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is statutorily independent in the performance of his function, and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on his decisions.</P>

Under the Act, the possession, distribution, importation and exportation or sale of all forms of child pornography &mdash; films, videos, or material in written or auditory form including material produced or transmitted via the Internet &mdash; are offences with penalties of up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment.  Mere possession of child pornography can be punishable by imprisonment for up  to 5 years.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, amendments to the Children Act 2001, introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, effectively raised the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 7 years to 12 years, in all but the most serious cases, and this provision was commenced on 16 October 2006.</P>
        <P>In the preparation of the recent legislation on the matter, careful consideration was given to getting the balance right,  taking into account the vulnerability of young people and the consequential <Col N="1883"/>obligation on the State to respond appropriately to their needs and behaviours.</P>
        <P>In practical terms what this means is that no child under 12 years of age can be charged with an offence apart from unlawful killing, a rape offence or aggravated sexual assault; and no proceedings can be taken against a child under 14 years except by or with the consent of the DPP.</P>
        <P>Where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reasonable grounds for believing that a child under 12 years of age has committed an offence, the child is to be taken to a parent or guardian.   If it is thought that the child is not receiving adequate care or protection, the member has a duty to inform the Health Service Executive and a care order may be obtained if required.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive are in consultation on a set of guidelines around the practicalities of the implementation of the new provisions regarding children and the restriction on criminal proceedings against children.  In addition, the amendments introduced to the Children Act 2001 by way of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 make provision for the admission of children aged 10 and 11 years of age to the Garda Youth Diversion Programme.</P>
        <P>In respect of children who are 12 years of age and over the Children Act 2001, as amended, provides for the appropriate intervention of both care and sanction and I am confident that sufficient safeguards have been included to protect the interests of the child, the victim and society.</P>
        <P>It is my intention, and that of my colleague the Minister for Children, to see the outstanding provisions of the 2001 Act implemented in early 2007.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have also established an overarching executive office in my Department, the Irish Youth Justice Service, which will, as part of its overall remit, oversee the implementation of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and develop a wide ranging national youth justice strategy.  These along with other developments are already creating improvements in our youth justice system and delivering better outcomes for children who come into contact with the law.</P>

	<P>I made a speech in Limerick concerning rebalancing criminal justice arose from concerns that the rights of the prosecution and the rights of the defence be evenly balanced. Having regard to the major changes which our society has undergone in recent years <Col N="1884"/>I consider that the principles underpinning our criminal justice system, while having largely served us well, were developed in a different era and would benefit from a robust examination to ensure that the proper balance is struck between the needs of the accused on the one hand and the needs of the victim and the community on the other.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Since my announcement of a special &euro;5M Integration Fund to help integrate legally- resident immigrants, my Department has established a variety of schemes and initiatives for its effective dispersal. A total of &euro;2M has been allocated to local partnerships working on locally-based initiatives and a further &euro;1M to national and regional NGOs working in the relevant area. The funding is being distributed through Pobal who are at an advanced stage of project selection with final decisions expected over the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;.9M is being used to accelerate the implementation of the National Action Plan against Racism. While no final decision have been taken at individual project level, this part of the funding is being focussed on the promotion of integration through sport, publicity initiatives and research on the management of cultural diversity in the workplace. It is expected that specific project allocations will be made by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The balance of the Fund (&euro;1.1M) will be used to implement a wide range of initiatives being managed by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) which is now part of the new Irish  Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.  A total of &euro;96,920 has been allocated to two specific projects to date: &euro;25,000 in support of the EPIC programme &mdash; an employment-based initiative and  &euro;71,920 for a parish-based integration programme being run by the Inter-Church Committee on Social Issues. However, as with the Pobal and NAPR aspects of the fund, the selection of detailed projects are, in the main, currently being finalised and decisions are expected over the next few weeks.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 218 together.</P><Col N="1887"/>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the ten crime classifications used to show the more serious crimes (headline offences) were first introduced in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Report of 2000.  The Deputy will be aware that, with respect to the year 2000, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na changed the system of crime presentation as part of the PULSE information technology project.  Specifically, the changeover to the PULSE platform allowed the Garda&iacute; to reorganise its crime classification system, so that it more accurately reflects the complex, modern criminal activities reported or known to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The previous crime classifications and sub-categorisations, based essentially on the distinction between indictable and non-indictable offences, were many decades old and were becoming increasingly unsuitable.  PULSE proved a considerable improvement in this respect, and the new classification of headline offences contains ten sub-divisions which offer a comprehensive description of modern criminal activity in a much more readily understandable form.</P>
        <P>Classification changes, to reflect the introduction of new legislation, were made in 2002. Changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 which required a minor change to Group 6 Larcenies, by changing the name of the offences from Larceny to Theft Offences.</P>
        <P>The introduction of this Act required greater change to Group 9, Fraud where the offences of Embezzlement and False Pretences were repealed by the Act of 2001. Four new classifications were created to replace the Falsification of Accounts/ Companies Offences. Three new offences, European Communities Fraud, Counterfeiting Notes and Coins, and Possession of Article (Fraud), were included in Group 9, Fraud.</P>
        <P>Coinage offences were removed from Group 10, Other Headline Offences, but replaced with a new classification, Counterfeiting Notes and Coins, in Group 9, Fraud.  The removal of Coinage Offences had no statistical impact as no offences had been recorded since the introduction of the new headline groups in 2000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2003 a new crime classification, Criminal Assets Bureau Offences, was added to Group 9, Fraud.  In 2005 two new headline offences were added. Sexual Offenders Act Offences were added to Group 3, Sexual Offences; and Employer Permit (Employer) Offences were added to Group 10, Other Headline Offences.</P>
        <P>Reclassification of crime is due, primarily, to the introduction of new legislation which creates new offences or repeals old ones. Any changes to the crime classifications are identified in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Report of the relevant year.</P>
        <P>Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group <Col N="1888"/>on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation, production and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO established a dedicated Unit for this purpose.</P>
        <P>The CSO published the reported crime statistics for the third quarter of 2006 on 27 October, 2006 marking the formal transfer for the published crime statistics from the Garda&iacute; to the CSO. The figures released by the CSO did not involve any change in the methodology from that used by the Garda authorities in the production of quarterly headline crime statistics.</P>
        <P>The CSO has established an Advisory Group to assist it in the development of crime and criminal justice statistics. One of the first tasks of the Advisory Group will be to review current methodology and to make recommendations for the development and presentation of crime statistics. In particular it will involve examination of:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the distinction between headline and non-headline offences;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the impact of the counting rules used where there are multiple offences involved in the one crime incident; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the development of a new robust classification of offences /incidents to be used in the future.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This review, which is to be informed by best practice in other countries, will better align crime statistics with public and specialist user needs. This element of the work of the Group should be completed in the first half of 2007.</P>
        <P>The CSO is also preparing to develop a more integrated and comprehensive system of crime statistics on crime and victimisation. This will include offences which do not necessarily come to the attention of the Garda&iacute; as well as offences that are often under reported to the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Finally, the CSO is giving consideration to the development of statistics on the wider criminal justice system to include the courts, prisons and probation services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 205 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 262 of 3 October, 2006 in which I indicated that I was aware of reports which suggest that prisoners are attempting criminal activities from inside prison cells. I want to reiterate that I am committed to implementing all appropriate measures to prevent the possibility of such activity and to ensure that the contact that prisoners have with the outside world is tightly controlled and monitored in an appropriate way.</P>
        <P>In this regard, prisoner visits in all closed prisons are carefully controlled and held in sight of prison officers and monitored on CCTV.  In addition, new visiting arrangements are in place in almost all closed prisons whereby only persons who have been pre-approved by the Governor are permitted to visit.  Telephone calls in closed prisons are monitored by prison officers and incoming and outgoing mail is subject to examination by a prison censor.  There is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues and I can advise the Deputy that Garda&iacute; will be contacted whenever any suspected criminal offence has taken place.</P>
        <P>One of the major challenges in prisons today lies in preventing access to contraband items, primarily mobile phones and drugs, which for obvious reasons, are viewed as highly valuable commodities which could assist in illegal activity from the prisoner cells.  Efforts are made on a continuous basis to prevent the flow of such contraband into our prisons, by for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, upgraded CCTV monitoring, the use of screened visits and the use of daily prisoner and cell searches.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service is currently <Col N="1890"/>examining technological options for dealing with the use of mobile phones within prisons.</P>
        <P>Random searches of cells and their occupants and searching of correspondence and all other items entering the prison have all intercepted significant quantities of contraband in recent years.  When a person is admitted to prison custody, he or she is searched and prohibited items and money are taken.  Similarly, searching takes place of prisoners returning from court, temporary release or after visits.  Searches of prisoners also take place where their behaviour or information received raises suspicions that they may be in possession of contraband.</P>
        <P>The Prison Service has recently conducted a number of trial tests on modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, U-bends in toilets, drain holes, under floor boards and other cavities. Initial tests would appear to indicate that these new technologies will be a valuable asset in this area.  The new prison estates at Thornton Hall and Spike Island will also make it harder for contraband to enter the prison over the perimeter walls by means of locating recreation yards away from perimeter walls and having a cordon sanitaire.</P>

	<P>The International Remote Gambling Summit was held in Ascot on Tuesday 31 October 2006.  I attended at the invitation of the host, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the Rt. Hon. Tessa Jowell, MP.  The proceedings were chaired by the Rt. Hon. Richard Caborn, Minister of State for Sport.  In excess of thirty States participated in the Summit.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Summit was to have an open and high-level political discussion about the future direction Governments should take in regard to remote gambling and to seek agreement on a draft Communiqu&eacute;.  While this Communiqu&eacute; had not been agreed at the end of the Conference, and is still being worked on, it seeks a commitment from participants that in enacting legislation or regulations in relation to remote gambling the principal and over-riding priorities will be:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The responsible conduct of remote gambling with appropriate safeguards to protect children and	vulnerable people;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The regulation of  remote gambling in accordance with generally accepted international standards to prevent fraud, money laundering and other crime;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />That remote gambling, where offered, should be verifiably fair to the consumer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The draft Communiqu&eacute; accepts that each jurisdiction may choose to address these priorities differently and, within the scope of international law and trade agreements, may choose to control gambling within its borders in a way that is appropriate to its national regulatory approach and particular circumstances.</P>
        <P>In addition, the draft Communiqu&eacute; seeks to identify areas for greater international cooperation including effective measures to protect children and vulnerable people, sharing research and expertise on remote gambling as well as methods of preventing problems, promoting public awareness of responsible gambling and developing effective licensing regimes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware, I have established an inter-departmental committee chaired by Mr. Michael McGrath BL to report on the possibilities for a legislative basis for the strict regulation of casino-style operations in the State, the composition of a Casino Regulation Commission and related matters.  The Casino Committee has also been asked to consider the issue of remote gambling.  I expect to receive the Casino Committee&rsquo;s report in the near future.  I attended the Summit, without prejudice to the work of that Committee, because I am aware of the issues surrounding remote gambling and wished to hear the views of other States on this important topic.  The Deputy will understand that, having established a committee to consider these complex issues, I do not <Col N="1892"/>propose to comment on future policy in advance of receiving and considering the report of the Casino Committee.</P>
        <P>I cannot comment on the non-participants at the Summit as I did not organise the event and I do not know what other States were invited.  I found the Summit extremely useful and informative and I commend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the Rt. Hon. Tessa Jowell, MP, for her initiative in organising such an opportune and well-timed political discussion.</P>

	<P>The Government decided not to participate in the adoption and application of the proposed Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003 (Brussels II bis) as regards jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning applicable law in matrimonial matters (COM2006 399), published on 17 July 2006.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission published the proposed Council Regulation following its Green paper on this subject in 2005 which launched a wide-ranging consultation process. The Government&rsquo;s decision not to opt-in to the adoption and application of this proposal is in line with its response to the Green Paper in November 2005. If Ireland were to accept this measure, it would permit EU nationals resident in Ireland to obtain a divorce in our courts on substantially different grounds than that provided for in our Constitution as allowed by the referendum on divorce in 1995, which is 4 years separation of the parties. It would also mean that the present Constitutional requirement on Irish Courts in divorce proceedings to grant a divorce only where proper provision is made for the parties involved and for dependent children would not apply in such cases.</P>
        <P>Under EU Treaty provisions in the area of civil law, Ireland does not participate in the adoption and implementation of such measures unless we exercise an option to so participate. In view of the concern that this measure would facilitate some couples in bypassing the special provisions introduced following the 1995 Constitutional amendment, which I have outlined, the Government <Col N="1893"/>took the decision not to exercise the option to participate in the adoption and implementation of this measure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the guidelines in An Bhratach N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, it is the normal practice to fly the National Flag daily at all military posts and from a limited number of important State Buildings equipped with a permanent flagpole. State Buildings equipped with more than one flagpole, including Government Buildings, the Four Courts, the General Post Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin also fly the European Union Flag at the same time.</P>
        <P>All Government Departments are notified by my Department on an annual basis of specific occasions during the year on which the National Flag should be flown from buildings under their <Col N="1894"/>control, equipped with a permanent flagpole,  e.g. Easter Sunday/Easter Monday and The National Day of Commemoration.</P>
        <P>Additionally, my Department advises on occasions when the National Flag should be flown at half mast such as on the death of a national or international figure.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The official population projections for the period since 2002 have been exceeded because the net inward migration flows in recent years have been higher than those assumed for the Census 2002-based population projections exercise. While no official forecast for 2007 exists, the recent experience would suggest a continuing annual increase of around 2 per cent in population and a slightly higher increase in the number of households.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 163 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an investigation was conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the incident referred to which concluded that no crime of forgery had been committed in this jurisdiction.  The matter was reviewed in 1997 and 2003 when the investigation file was submitted to the Law Officers, who directed no prosecution in the matter.</P>
        <P>Further documentation has recently been provided to Garda&iacute; by the person referred to and this is currently being examined.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware I have no role in the investigation or prosecution of cases.  This is a long standing principle of our system of justice.  The role of the Garda&iacute; is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP.  The Director, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law.  In the circumstances it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment further on the case.</P>

	<P>The average processing time for applications for certificates of naturalisation is approximately 24 months and this is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years. The table below shows the number of applications received in the years 2000 to date. These figures illustrate a significant upward trend.  With over 5,500 applications <Col N="1919"/>received to date in 2006, this upward trend looks set to continue and it appears likely that some 6,500 will be received this year.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>The documentation accompanying the application form for naturalisation provides potential applicants with a general overview of the procedures and processing times, although further information can be obtained, if required, by telephoning the Citizenship Section helpline on Tuesdays or Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. at Lo-call 1890 551 500 or (01) 6167700.</P>
        <P>The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation are as set out in summary form below.  Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, over 3,000 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant&rsquo;s financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time enquiries are also made with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.  Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.  The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.</P><Col N="1920"/>
        <P>The above procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  Consequently, having regard to the resources currently available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.</P>

        <P>With regard to two specific major incidents involving security companies I am informed by the Garda Authorities that, in relation to the false imprisonment of a family and the robbery of over &euro;2 million from a security company in April, 2005, following an intensive investigation a &lsquo;search and arrest&rsquo; operation took place on the 27th April, 2005 during which twenty-six people were arrested and detained under the provisions of Section 30 Offences Against the State Act 1939/98. A number of firearms, drugs with an estimated street value of &euro;750,000, and a large quantity of cash were seized. A significant amount of documentation and other evidence was also recovered.</P>
        <P>Two persons were charged with offences relating to the drugs and firearms. An investigation file was submitted to the Law Officers in respect of the other people arrested and charges of robbery and false imprisonment against eight other individuals were directed.</P>
        <P>In relation to a second robbery in April 2005 during which &euro;1.9 million was taken from another security company, a number of searches were carried out the following day and significant evidence was seized. The investigation is on-going.</P>
        <P>Intelligence-led operations and initiatives are continuously being conducted by local Garda management, at District, Divisional and Regional levels, in conjunction with the national specialist units under Assistant Commissioner, National <Col N="1921"/>Support Services, to target criminals, their associates and crime gangs, and their finances, respon<Col N="1922"/>sible for this type of criminality in order to disrupt and disband such crime networks.</P><Col N="1921"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 to 173, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The provision of services to the Thornton Hall site to service the prison development has been the subject of detailed discussions between the relevant officials at Fingal County Council and the Prison Service and its technical advisors.  Discussions have also been held with the various utilities including the Electricity Supply Board.  Arising from these discussions, agreement in principle has been reached with the Council for the servicing of the water and sewerage requirements along existing public roadways i.e. the N2 and the R130.  It has, in addition, been agreed with the Electricity Supply Board that the required electricity supply will be sourced from existing lines adjac<Col N="1922"/>ent to the site.  It is not the case, therefore, that these services will be run through significant areas of land that are zoned agricultural.  The security aspects of allowing other parties access to services for the prison in the immediate proximity of the site is still under consideration.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to Part 11 of the Planning and Development Act 2001, I can only assume that this should be a reference to the Act of the same name of 2000.  I am advised that the provision of the services referred to the Thornton site does not fall within the remit of this section of the Act.</P>

        <P>The Louth/Meath Division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units, all of which have had increased resources to provide a comprehensive policing service to the community.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P><Col N="1924"/>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the attested strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Navan Garda Station will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State and claimed asylum on 10 November, 2000.  He failed to attend at interview with the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and a recommendation <Col N="1925"/>that he should not be declared a refugee was made on 18 April, 2002.</P>
        <P>Consequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed on 31 October, 2002 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.   He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before a Deportation Order is made; or consenting to the making of a Deportation Order.  No representations were received from or on behalf of the person concerned.  I subsequently signed a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned on 16 December, 2002.   He was notified of his impending deportation from the State by letter dated, 27 January, 2003.</P>
        <P>On 31 January, 2003 the person concerned informed the Department through a legal advisor that he was the parent of an Irish born child and that he intended to apply for residency on that basis.  He further stated that he intended to initiate Judicial Review proceedings.</P>
        <P>As a consequence of the Judicial Review proceedings this person&rsquo;s case was further reviewed and I decided to revoke the Deportation Order and grant him temporary leave to remain in the State.   This decision was communicated to the person concerned by letter dated 15 January, 2004.</P>
        <P>The leave to remain was subsequently extended for a further year on 02 June, 2005.  The person in question applied for further renewal of his leave to remain by letter dated 03 May, 2006.   Permission to remain in the State for a further year has now been granted to the person concerned and a letter of confirmation will issue in early course.</P>

	<P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the cases before the Equality Tribunal. The Equality Tribunal is the impartial forum to hear or mediate complaints of alleged discrimination under equality legislation. It is independent and quasi-judicial and its decisions and mediated settlements are legally binding. The equality legislation prohibits discrimination on 9 grounds &mdash; gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. </P>
        <P>For the period January to June, 2006, the number of cases referred to the Equality Tribunal under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2004, on the race ground alone, was 64 involving 105 individuals. There were 6 decisions issued by the Equality Tribunal and of these one was upheld in favour of the complainant. The figures for previous years are set out below:</P><Col N="1925"/>

        <P FLI="0">While there is a rise in &lsquo;cases&rsquo; on the race ground taken to the Equality Tribunal, this is more likely to reflect the huge growth in the numbers of workers from abroad who are now in the workforce rather than any increase in intolerance in the workplace.  It should also be borne in mind that these figures refer to &lsquo;cases&rsquo; and not to &lsquo;decisions&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>I would also like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the increased awareness of the needs of the intercultural workplace and the renewed emphasis on the enforcement of employment protections so as to tackle workplace discrimination and exploitation. The Equality Authority, with the support of the social partners and the National Action Plan Against Racism, organises Anti-Racist Workplace Week which is taking place this week. This will be the eight year of operation. The aim of the week is to raise awareness in organisations of the need to combat racism and promote support for the accommodation of diversity in the workplace.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016, the Ten Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015, while recognising the broad level of compliance with employment rights across the economy generally, includes a commitment between the parties to securing enhanced compliance with legal requirements, underpinned by adequate enforcement. It was agreed, in particular, that an effective employment rights compliance system should be put in place. The parties to Towards 2016 have agreed a major package of measures with these aims in mind. The package makes provision for the establishment of a new statutory Office of the Director for Employment Rights Compliance (ODERC) under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, led by a Director at top management level.</P>
        <P>The number of Labour Inspectors under this Office will be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by end-2007, as part of an initiative to increase the staffing resources of the Employment Rights Bodies generally. In addition, the new Office will be provided with legal, accounting and other administrative support to ensure its effective functioning.</P>
        <P>The necessary legislation to establish the new Office will be published during 2007.  In the meantime, the ODERC and its Advisory Board will be established on an interim basis.</P>

Local Garda management has also appointed a Garda Liaison Officer to the commercial centre in Wexford, who has visited a number of business premises offering crime prevention information, including security advice.  In August, 2006 the local Superintendent met representatives of the local business associations and the Chamber of Commerce. Arising from this, a Crime Prevention Seminar has been organised for 14 November at which the Divisional Crime Prevention Officer and a representative from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigations will be available to offer crime prevention advice to local business owners and staff.</P>

	<P>Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, dealing with public service employment of persons with disabilities, came into effect on 31 December 2005. It places the 3% employment target in the public service on a statutory footing. Under section 48 of the Act, a public service body must prepare a report for submission to the relevant monitoring committee established under the Act on its compliance with the requirements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2006 by 31 March 2007 at the latest. The monitoring committees established by Ministers in respect of the public bodies under their aegis have until 30 June 2007 at the latest to report  both to the relevant Minister and the National Disability Authority on compliance by the relevant public bodies with the requirements. The Act confers significant new monitoring functions in this regard on the National Disability Authority.</P>
        <P>It is in the context of these new statutory arrangements and timeframes that the current position will be formally reported for all areas of the public service.</P>
        <P>In the implementation of these provisions, Government Departments and any other public body staffed by civil servants are accountable to the Minister for Finance, while local authorities and organisations within the Health Service Executive are accountable respectively to the Ministers for Environment, Heritage and Local Government and for Health and Children.  All other public bodies are accountable to the relevant Minister.</P>

	<P>The number of applications for naturalisation on hand as of 2 November 2006, including applications based on marriage to an Irish citizen, is approximately 11,000.

        <Quest> the reason applications for certificates of naturalisation, lodged by persons who are married to Irish citizens for three years, take a further two years to process from the date of application; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that such delays cause hardship and inconvenience to many families; and if he will take steps to have such applications dealt with efficiently in his Department within a reasonable time. </Quest>

	<P>Applications for <Col N="1931"/>certificates of naturalisation, including those from persons married to Irish citizens, are generally dealt with in chronological order as this method is deemed to be fairest to all applicants. The average processing time for such applications is approximately 24 months and this is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years.</P>
        <P>The table below shows the total number of applications received in the years 2000 to date. I should point out that statistics are not maintained in such a manner as to readily identify applications from the spouses of Irish citizens from other applicants. These figures illustrate a significant upward trend in the number of applications received in recent years.  With over 5,500 applications received to date in 2006, this upward trend looks set to continue and it appears likely that some 6,500 will be received this year.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation are as set out in summary form below.  Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, over 3,000 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant&rsquo;s financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time enquiries are also made with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to <Col N="1932"/>clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.  Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.  The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.</P>
        <P>The above procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  Consequently, having regard to the resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are no plans at present to provide a Garda CCTV system for Longford Town.  I understand, however, that there are a number of CCTV cameras in operation on Main Street, Longford which were funded and installed by local business people and are operated voluntarily.  Neither the Garda authorities or my Department have any involvement with this CCTV system.</P>
        <P>I am advised that there is no record of any formal application for a Garda CCTV system in Longford.  All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda District and Divisional Officers and must receive their full support.  Applications must then be submitted by the Divisional Officer to the Garda Advisory Committee for consideration and evaluation on the basis of Garda operational needs.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that an application for grant-aid funding under my Department&rsquo;s Community Based CCTV Scheme was received from Longford Town Council.  The Scheme is being administered by Pobal  on behalf of my Department.  I understand that following a thorough assessment of their application, Longford Town Council&rsquo;s application for funding was deemed not to reach a high enough standard to be granted funding.  I am further advised that Pobal provided feedback on applications directly to all unsuccessful applicants under the Scheme, including Longford Town Council.</P>
        <P>Applications for funding are thoroughly assessed by Pobal against the criteria set out in the Community Based CCTV Scheme Application Guidelines with a view to forming a list of projects suitable for funding under the Scheme. <Col N="1933"/> All applications, including those recommended for funding by Pobal, are then considered by the Community Based CCTV Project Board, which is chaired by my Department, before a final decision is taken on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I intend to invite a new round of applications for funding under the Community Based CCTV Scheme in the coming weeks, and it will be open to Longford Town Council to submit another application for funding at that stage having taken on board the feedback from Pobal about their earlier application.</P>

	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy has expressed an interest in transferring to a prison in Ireland under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  However, the formal application and necessary supporting documentation has not been received to date from the United Kingdom authorities.  My Department has already written to the United Kingdom authorities requesting them to commence processing this individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>The Convention requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered.  A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here.</P>
        <P>These procedures are required under the Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, and must be adhered to in processing each application.</P>

Fuel is supplied through retail forecourts in each Division and is paid centrally through Finance Section on a monthly basis.  The forecourts used under this arrangement are Esso, Texaco Statoil and Shell.</P>
        <P>In some rural areas (where a major fuel dealer is not present) fuel is purchased locally and paid monthly from the local Imprest Account (District Office).

      </Qst>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As and from 1 January, 2007 the main immigration law which will apply to Romanian and Bulgarian nationals is the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No 226 of 2006).  Those Regulations, which I signed on 28 April 2006, transposed into Irish law the European Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.  Visa requirements will no longer apply to those nationals and they will be able to enter the State on production of their passport and/or national identity card and they may reside here for up to three months.  Thereafter, they must be: in lawful employment; self-employed; enrolled on a course of study or vocational training and have private medical insurance; or, self-sufficient and have private medical insurance.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is well aware, in respect of Romanian and Bulgarian nationals the purpose of their short-term visit is not of importance as they will be citizens of the European Union.  They will have the same rights as other EU citizens apart from one restriction whereby Romanian and Bulgarian nationals may not enter employment in the State except in accordance with an Employment Permit, or where they are otherwise exempt.  Apart from that, there will be no special rules applicable to Romanian and Bulgarian nationals arising from those countries&rsquo; accession to the EU.</P>
        <P>Nationals of Romania and Bulgaria who have been the subject of Deportation Orders cannot expect to be automatically allowed to reside in or re-enter the State following the accession of their countries of origin to the European Union.  Freedom of movement for European citizens is not an absolute right.  It is subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security and public health.  Where a deportation order has been made against an individual from either of the two countries it is open to the person concerned to apply for revocation of that order if <Col N="1936"/>they wish to ensure that there will not be a bar to free movement.  I will consider any such applications under the power conferred on me by section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999.  I would be open to the revocation of deportation orders which were made in respect of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens solely on the grounds that they were failed asylum seekers or general illegal immigrants where issues of security or criminal behaviour did not arise in the particular cases as a reason for their deportation.</P>
        <P>Under the Free Movement Regulations, I have the power to make an Expulsion Order or Removal Order in respect of any EU citizen who might seek to enter this State, or who resides here, on limited grounds set out in the Regulations.</P>

        <P>I am further informed that Garda Fleet Management policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that official vehicles are maintained to a standard where there are no unsafe vehicles in use by the Force.

The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that within the range of vehicles available to the Garda Traffic Corps there are currently 62 marked Garda patrol cars.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that Garda Traffic Corps vehicles are sufficiently equipped to carry out speed enforcement.</P>
        <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are not members of the Traffic Corps have the responsibility, inter alia, to deal with traffic duties when breaches of road traffic law occur.  Marked and unmarked patrol vehicles driven by these members are therefore also available for road traffic law enforcement.</P>

        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allo<Col N="1939"/>cations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the attested strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Garda Stations will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>Further to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 275 on 24 October last, I have checked the matter further with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who is responsible for the issuing and renewal of Registration Certificates.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the person in question did call to Abbeyleix Garda Station on 14th March 2006 with a view to renewing his Registration Certificate.  The Commissioner informs me that the Certificate could not be issued at the time by the local Immigration Officer pending the consideration of certain issues.  A renewed Certificate of Registration has since issued and is now available for collection by him from Abbeyleix Garda Station.  I regret the inaccurate information given in my earlier reply with regard to the person not reporting to Abbeyleix Garda Station which was based on general enquiries that have since been corrected by an up to date Garda report.  I trust this now clarifies the matter.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of persons reported missing and remaining untraced at the end of 2005 was 395.  The figure for 2006 will not be available until after year end.</P>
        <P>The Missing Persons Bureau in Garda Headquarters is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons.  The District Officer in the area where a person has been reported missing takes direct responsibility for all issues relating to the investigation of the circumstances of the missing person.  All cases of a person reported missing in suspicious circumstances remain open and under ongoing review and investigation until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner.</P>
        <P>At present, local Garda management takes direct responsibility for missing person cases, and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary.  All missing persons are recorded on the PULSE system.  When a person is reported missing, the local Garda Superintendent will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, for example, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation or the Technical Bureau.  The systems put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to manage and deal with reports of missing persons are in line with best international police practice, and Garda management have assured me that they are satisfied that the systems in place are adequate to deal with any reported case of a missing person.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na interacts fully and as appropriate with all of the media outlets &mdash; print, radio and TV &mdash; in highlighting cases involving missing persons.  The services of other external agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation.  In addition, every Garda District has a specially trained search team that is familiar with the locality.  The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated <Col N="1941"/>subject on the curriculum at the Garda College, Templemore, and is also a subject covered in in-service training.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities are continuously monitoring international developments in relation to investigations of missing persons in order to ensure that best practice is followed.  If their professional judgement is that some change in the existing legislation, protocols or structures would be of assistance in improving investigations, this would be considered by me.</P>

        <P Just="Left"><i>Note: </i>All prisoners in the Training Unit Place of Detention and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution were single occupants of a cell on 3 November 2006.  Accordingly, neither institution is included in the above table.  Where possible, it is the aim of the Prison Service to provide single cell occupancy for all sentenced prisoners.  Exceptions are made for some prisoners who actually seek to double-up.  Prisoners may ask to share a cell with a friend or relative in custody and such requests are facilitated where possible.  Doubling up may also occur from time to time to meet concerns about the physical/mental health of a prisoner.  On Friday 3 November 2006, a total of 1,744 prisoners were single occupants of a cell or unit.</P>

</table><Col N="1941"/>
                <P FLI="0" Just="Left">It is anticipated that the new prison buildings at Thornton Hall and Spike Island will allow for increased single cell usage.  The construction of new facilities will address the issue of cell occupancy levels and will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work training, education, medical services and in-cell sanitation.  It must be noted, however, that accommodating prisoners is not simply a matter of matching the global prisoner population to a global figure for beds or cells.  A number of factors have to be taken into account including the prisoners' age, gender, the nature of the offence, location, security and whether they are on remand or sentenced.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all incidents involving the use of firearms, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation.  The identification of the motive and the evidence available in its support are key elements of the investigation and prosecution process.  Speculation as to the nature of the motive could serve to jeopardise successful investigation and prosecution of these serious crimes.</P>
        <P>Garda management have introduced a number of intelligence-led policing initiatives, including Operation Anvil and Operation Steel, specifically targeting those involved in armed crime.  The focus of such operations is the targeting of active criminals and their associates by preventing and disrupting this type of criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling, static checkpoints and by uniform mobile and foot patrols supported by armed plain-clothes patrols and other specialist units.</P>
        <P>This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  These initiatives are reviewed by Garda management on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.</P>
        <P>In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.</P>
        <P>With regard to legislative measures, the Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides a comprehensive package of <Col N="1946"/>anti-crime measures which enhance the powers of the Garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of offences.  In addition, the Act contains an essential updating of our criminal law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society.</P>
        <P>In relation to firearms, the new Act updates and strengthens the law.  With effect from 1 November, mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, came into effect for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest came into effect.  There are also new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as &ldquo;sawing-off&rdquo; a shotgun.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that based on the definitive Census figures available, which is the 2002 census population figure, the ratio of Garda&iacute; per 100,000 of the civilian population for the years 2000, 2002, 2005 and as at 3 November, 2006 was as set out in the table hereunder.

        <Quest> if garda&iacute; have sufficient resources to respond to the needs of residents and community groups who bring to their attention the growing incidents of anti-social activity, more often in the vicinity or adjacent to public open space or recreational areas in housing estates and where serious drug dealing, car theft, malicious damage and intimidation of residents takes place on a regular basis; if he will appoint a dedicated task force to deal with such activity which is becoming more sinister with the passage of time; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36586/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns expressed about anti-social behaviour and its effects on communities.  In many anti-social incidents, vulnerable people, often the elderly, are subjected to serious nuisance and forms of harassment which cause significant and persistent distress to the those concerned, and interfere fundamentally with their capacity to enjoy quiet and peaceful lives.  Often such people are simply too frightened to stand up to their persecutors.  Equally, few of them have the financial resources to engage lawyers to seek private law injunction-type remedies to protect their rights to enjoyment of their property.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 contains provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour.  The Act empowers a senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner.</P>
        <P>Separate provision is being made in relation to young people.  The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act, 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There will be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.  Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the Courts.</P>
        <P>The relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 will be commenced following consultations between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The purpose of this is to <Col N="1948"/>ensure that these provisions will commence as soon as the Commissioner has made the necessary internal arrangements to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.  Work by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is underway to draw up the necessary procedures to implement the provisions.</P>
        <P>Strong provisions are in place to combat vandalism and anti-social behaviour.  The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I have brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.  One of the provisions of the Act is to broaden the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which was originally introduced to combat under-age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of offences, such as a licensee supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and permitting disorderly conduct on the licensed premises.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licences, late night clubs and food premises where there is disorder or noise on or close to the premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals convicted of a range of public order offences, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the 1994 Public Order Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a pro-active approach to policing anti-social/public disorder issues by immediate intervention, arrest and prosecutions or advice, as appropriate.  Local Garda management  provide for this in policing plans and make every effort to provide a highly visible police presence on the streets of our towns and villages through the deployment of uniform Garda&iacute;, detective units, divisional traffic corps, community policing units and mountain bike units as appropriate.  Garda patrols pay particular attention to areas where the public tends to congregate such as licensed venues and fast food outlets while awaiting transport, so as to prevent and detect incidents of public disorder.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that Operation Encounter which was introduced by Garda management in 2002 targets public disorder offences including assaults and drinking by underage persons.</P>
        <P>Under the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme Divisional Juvenile Liaison Officers regularly visit schools, youth clubs and social services to give presentations under the education programme and highlight alternative options for reg<Col N="1949"/>ular offenders.  Community Garda&iacute; and the Garda Schools Liaison Officers also visit schools and address young people on a variety of topics including anti social behaviour.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are frequently in contact with other Government and non-government agencies, including the Health Service Executive and the local authorities in order to have a multi-agency approach to addressing criminal issues.  This multi-agency liaison will continue.</P>
        <P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development and promote civic responsibility.  The Garda Youth Diversion Projects are funded by my Department and administered through Garda Community Relations Section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The allocation of funding for the 74 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (along with 7 Local Drug Task Force Projects) in 2006 is just over &euro;6.6 million, which is an increase of &euro;1.2 million on 2005.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.  As part of this expansion, ten new projects were established this year and they are located in Blanchardstown, Birr, Carlow, Castlebar, Cavan, Clondalkin, Limerick, Tallaght and Tralee (two projects). I expect to announce a further ten projects in the near future.</P>
        <P>In relation to Garda Resources I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,137.</P>
        <P>There has also been excellent progress made in relation to the establishment of the Garda Reserve.  Over 7,000 have applied to join the Reserve.  Reserve members will provide valuable support for their full-time colleagues and will enhance the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to emerging policing challenges and allow for more Garda&iacute; to be visibly deployed on the street.  The first group of trainees are due to graduate in December.</P>
        <P>The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, which represents a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.  In addition to expenditure on operations, these resources are <Col N="1950"/>also being used to provide required facilities.  Most recently, significant property has been purchased in Tipperary to provide a major tactical and practical training centre for the Force.  This will enable a broad range of training facilities to be developed.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

        <P>All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuing to conduct an ongoing major crackdown on organised crime, including drug trafficking and other types of organised criminality and the Garda authorities now have a record level of resources available, both in financial and personnel terms, in order to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out its functions.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities advise that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na made up of the number of attested Garda&iacute; plus recruits in training now stands at a record high of 14,137 and that the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government to recruit an additional 2,000 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been met.</P>
        <P>The Garda budget is now at an all-time historic high having reached &euro;1.310 billion, which is more than double the budget for 1997.  The 2006 Garda overtime allocation has risen by &euro;22.4m to &euro;83.5m, which represents an increase of 36.6% over the allocation of &euro;61.1m for 2005.  This will facilitate, among other things, the continuation of operations targeted at the prevention and detection of crimes such as gangland murders, organised crime, racketeering and other criminal activity which gives rise to serious community concern.</P>
        <P>I am informed by Garda management that they are satisfied that the Criminal Assets Bureau has sufficient resources for it to operate effectively pursuant to its statutory remit.  The Criminal Assets Bureau has been at the forefront of the fight against organised crime in this jurisdiction since its inception in 1996.  The manner in which <Col N="1953"/>the Bureau operates has, in that 10 year period, come to be viewed, both domestically and internationally, as a very successful model for targeting persons seeking to derive profits from criminal activities.</P>
        <P>The assignment of staff to the Bureau from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs ensures a multi-disciplinary, coordinated and integrated approach to the identification, freezing and seizure of criminal proceeds, the assessment and collection of unpaid taxes, and the recovery of social welfare overpayments.</P>
        <P>The resources available to the Bureau, including manpower, facilities and technology, are kept under continuous review to ensure that it is fully able to fulfil its statutory remit.  In this context, in late 2005 following consultation with the Garda Commissioner, my Department secured Department of Finance sanction for two additional specialist staff for the CAB.  These staff, a financial crime analyst and a forensic accountant have recently been recruited.  There is also now a Divisional criminal assets profiler based in every Garda Division nationwide, increasing the capacity of the organisation to target the finances of criminals.  The Chief Bureau Officer closely monitors the allocation of personnel and the matter also remains under constant review by local Garda management.</P>
        <P>In addition, Operation Anvil was launched on the 17 May, 2005 in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  It is an intelligence-led policing initiative the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associated involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting this criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling, and static checkpoints, by uniform mobile and foot patrols supported by armed plain-clothes patrols.  Operation Anvil has been extended nationwide during 2006 and consists of a series of special operations, proposed by each Regional Assistant Commissioner, which are designed to focus on  areas and incidence of high crime.</P>
        <P>In November 2005 an additional 55 members were allocated to augment the Organised Crime Unit of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation to address the problem of criminal gang activity and serious crime continues to be detected through police operations resulting in significant numbers of firearms and quantities of drugs and money being seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are a number of persons currently before the Courts arising from these policing initiatives.</P>
        <P>On an international level An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na constantly strives to increase the level of cooperation, through international law enforcement agencies, Interpol and Europol in the enforcement of drug legislation and to proactively target those individuals and criminal gangs involved in criminal activities to disrupt and disband such networks.  Garda Liaison Officers are currently in <Col N="1954"/>place in the UK, Spain, the Netherlands, and at Europol and Interpol.</P>
        <P>Finally, I can assure the Deputy that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling serious crime under continuing review, and to this end I will continue to ensure that every necessary resource is made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 to 225, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The CONNECT project was launched in 2000 as a part of the Prison Service Training and Development Programme under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006.  There is no separate budget for this programme and it was not funded by the European Union; all funding during the period 2000 to 2006 was provided annually by the exchequer as part of the Prisons Vote.  This followed on from the piloting of the project from 1998 to 2000, which was carried out under funding from EU INTEGRA Employment Initiative.  This EU funding related only to the piloting period and no EU funding was available to the project thereafter.</P>
        <P>Expenditure since 2000 has gone to funding salary and incidental costs incurred in providing vocational training in the prisons and the provision of support to the Project by the National Training and Development Institute (NDTI), as well as meeting the cost of some capital works, notably the new laundry training facilities at Wheatfield Prison, and materials used in the manufacture of products in prison workshops for the Special Olympics in 2003.  While the industrial relations and attendant financial difficulties during the period impacted on the CONNECT Project, the ongoing operation of the work training element, while somewhat constrained, resulted in the significant majority of the National Development Plan funding being expended.</P>
        <P>The future roll out plans for the various elements of the CONNECT Project are being considered in the context of the elaboration of a system of Positive Sentence Management in the prisons.  Specifically, the individual programme planning elements that were part of the project need to be more centrally located in the Prison Service&rsquo;s sentence management systems.  Experience of the project was that while its original purpose was to assist prisoners in making vocational choices, in fact much work focussed on personal development which would assist prisoners pursuing a crime free life on their release.  The work training elements envisaged under the project are currently being enhanced across the prison system.  This involves the provision of dedicated new staffing and funding for the expansion of work training in the prison system, which will result in an increase in the number of authorised work training staff posts from c. 215 to c. 250.</P>
        <P>A group to examine the elaboration of Positive Sentence Management has reported to the Director General of the Irish Prison Service.  Their Report details a proposed model of sentence management based on multidisciplinary working.  The Report also details a number of areas that require further work to underpin the process; these include assessment processes, information sharing systems and working relationships, both with the prisons and with the community.  Piloting <Col N="1957"/>of the proposed system on an action research basis will begin in at least one institution in the coming month.  The purpose of the piloting process is to further develop the system by getting feedback from prison-based staff on the practical operation of the structures and processes proposed.  In parallel to the prison based piloting, working groups have also been established to examine specific elements of the underpinning processes (i.e. assessment and information sharing).</P>
        <P>Finally, the work training elements envisaged under the CONNECT project at Limerick Prison are being developed as part of the overall expansion of work training in the prison system, which I have outlined above.  The sentence management elements of the project will be addressed in the context of the roll-out of Positive Sentence Management.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a repayment of nursing home charges in the case of a deceased patient would form part of the estate of that deceased person, and would be paid out to beneficiaries under the terms of the deceased patient&rsquo;s will or, in accordance with the Succession Act 1965 where the patient died intestate.</P>
        <P>The capital acquisitions tax code charges to tax any benefit taken by a beneficiary upon the death of another person.  In the case of a repayment of nursing home charges, the benefit of the repayment (or part thereof) is taken by the beneficiary, since the patient who incurred the charges in the first place is deceased and consequently, inheritance tax is potentially due from the beneficiaries concerned.  It should be noted that the capital acquisitions tax code also provides for very generous thresholds which may result in a beneficiary not paying any inheritance tax on a benefit.  The threshold amounts for 2006 (after indexation) are:</P>

I am further advised that the treatment for tax purposes of the repayment is exactly the same as it would be if the Estate of the deceased had been enlarged, by for example, a previously <Col N="1958"/>unknown bank account, where the proceeds pass on to the relevant beneficiaries.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for an allowance at the standard rate of income tax for individuals who, for a tax year of assessment, prove that they have paid rent in respect of a residential premises that is their main residence.   The definition of rent for the purposes of Section 473 is such that it refers only to the bare right to use, occupy or enjoy the premises and it also excludes payments in respect of the provision of goods and services.  For example, payment in respect of &lsquo;board and lodgings&rsquo; would not be considered rent for the purposes of the rent allowance.</P>
        <P>Where it appears that a payment is made partly on account of rent and partly on account of an amount which is not rent, Section 473 provides that an apportionment of the payment may be made in order to determine for the purposes of <Col N="1960"/>that section the amount paid on account of rent. The legislation further provides that, where such apportionment is required, such apportionment shall be made by an inspector of taxes according to the best of his or her knowledge and judgment.</P>
        <P>There is no requirement in Section 473 that, for the purposes of that section, rent must be charged at a commercial rate and, accordingly, the market value of the family home is not a factor for the purposes of Section 473.</P>
        <P>There is no special treatment for individuals residing in the parental home wishing to claim the rent allowance.  However, in such cases there is the question as to whether an amount paid by such individuals to their parents represents rent within the meaning of the Section 473 or whether such amount represents a payment in respect of board and lodging including items such as heat and light. For example, in the case of working individuals who continue to live with their parents, it would not be considered unusual if such individuals contributed to normal family outgoings.   Whether such contribution can be categorised a &lsquo;pure rent&rsquo; or whether it is, or includes, an amount in respect of normal outgoings such as the cost of food, light, heat, etc. is a question of fact to be determined having regard to the facts and circumstances of the relevant case being examined.  In addition, claims for the rent allowance are examined on their individual merits and what may prevail in one case may not necessarily be replicated in another case.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; customer service staff process claims for rent allowance, as they do with claims for other allowances and tax credits.  Local managers monitor claims and critically examine a number of such claims as part of their normal compliance programmes.   As regards written guidelines and instructions, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that staff instructions are in place outlining the basis for the allowance and that staff also have access to the necessary legislation and to the Notes for Guidance to that legislation.</P>
        <P>As regards a review or appeal process generally, these are outlined in the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Customer Service Leaflet CS4 available at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>. In brief, there are separate mechanisms in place for persons to:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Lodge a customer service complaint about the standard of service received in their personal contact with the Revenue Commissioners, e.g. by phone, correspondence, fax, e-mail or as a caller at one of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Public Offices.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Request an internal review in relation to any aspect of the way in which their tax affairs have been handled (there is also provision for this review to be carried out jointly by an internal and external reviewer).</P>
       <P LI="1">3. Lodge an appeal under statutory provisions (such appeals are heard, in the first <Col N="1961"/>instance, by the Tax Appeal Commissioners).  Section 473(7) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines a specific right of appeal against apportionment and any person who is aggrieved by a decision of an inspector as regards such apportionment may, by notice in writing to that effect given to the inspector within thirty days from the date on which notice is given by the inspector, make an application to have his or her claim for relief heard and determined by the Tax Appeal Commissioners.  In addition, any person dissatisfied with any aspect of Revenue&rsquo;s handling of his/her tax affairs may take the matter up with the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Finally, where an individual rents out a room (or rooms) in a qualifying residence (being a residential premises in the State, which is occupied by that individual as his or her principal private residence during the year of assessment) and the gross amount received by that individual, including sums arising for food, laundry or similar goods and services does not exceed &euro;7,620, then such income will be exempt from income tax. Parents in receipt of amounts paid by persons living in the parental home are not precluded from entitlement to the rent a room exemption.	</P>

        <Quest> if he will change the system of benefit in kind in order that the tax burden would no longer decrease in inverse proportion to the number of miles covered and the size of the vehicle&rsquo;s engine. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are special rules for estimating the value of the benefit of company provided cars which are available for the private use of employees.  Where annual business mileage is 15,000 miles or less the benefit of the car is calculated at 30% of the original market value with this figure reducing in the context of higher annual business mileage categories.  For example, where the business mileage is 30,001 business miles and over the cash benefit is calculated at 6% of the original market value of the car.  </P>
        <P>This tapering of rates is designed to ensure that employees who need to travel significantly in the course of their work can incur a lower benefit-in-kind charge, based on their actual yearly mileage. There is no evidence to suggest that this encourages employees to artificially increase their business mileage in order to maximise their tax position.  Indeed as such an approach would result in additional costs for employers (e.g. by way of extra fuel costs) they would be unlikely to countenance it.  Overall I would regard the current scheme as relatively neutral in terms of its effect on the environment.</P>

	<P>The Deposit Protection Scheme is a system to compensate depositors in the event of the failure of a credit institution.  The European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations, 1995, which came into effect on 1 July 1995, set out the terms and conditions governing deposit protection in Ireland.  Responsibility for funding the Irish deposit protection scheme rests with participating credit institutions, which are authorised by the Central Bank &amp; Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The system is administered by the Central Bank &amp; Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  Deposits with credit institutions authorised in another European Economic Area (EEA) country and operating in Ireland on a branch basis are covered under that country&rsquo;s system. </P>
        <P>The level of contribution required from each credit institution is 0.2% of deposits held at all branches of the credit institution in the EEA (EU member-states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).  A minimum contribution of &euro;25,400 is required.  Each contribution is maintained in a Deposit Protection Account at the Central Bank &amp; Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The maximum amount payable to any depositor is 90% of the aggregate deposits held by that depositor subject to a maximum compensation payment of &euro;20,000.  Thus, a depositor with a deposit account totalling &euro;5,000 would receive compensation of &euro;4,500 while a depositor with deposits of &euro;22,222 or more would receive the maximum compensation of &euro;20,000.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank &amp; Financial Services Authority of Ireland (or liquidator, where one has been appointed) is expected to pay compensation to depositors within three months of a determination by the Central Bank &amp; Financial Services Authority of Ireland that deposits are unavailable, or of a ruling by the court (subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Regulations).</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.</P>
	<P>There is no State savings guarantee for savers with Irish credit institutions generally.  There is, however, a deposit protection scheme funded by credit institutions (other than credit unions) which are authorised by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The Deputy should note that a key principle underlining the operation of the deposit protection scheme is that the full cost of financing the scheme must be borne by the participating credit institutions. The level of contribution required from each credit institution is 0.2% of deposits held at all branches of the credit institution in the EEA, including deposits on current accounts and share accounts with a building society (but excluding certain other specified deposits). Contributions are maintained in a Deposit Protection Account at the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations, 1995 set out the terms and conditions governing deposit protection in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the case of credit unions the Irish League of Credit Unions operates a separate Savings Protection Scheme (SPS). The SPS aims to protect the individual savings of members by making sure that the credit unions are financially and administratively sound and by providing remedial help to any participating credit union which shows signs of weakness in these areas.  Savings of individual credit union members are also protected. The operation of the credit union SPS is consistent with the specific regulatory approach adopted for credit unions under the Credit Union Act, 1997 which is differentiated from that applying to mainstream commercial financial institutions on account of the unique ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement.  In this context, the 32 county all-island basis of the current SPS is valuable and one that it is important to maintain. In May 2006 the Financial Regulator agreed to <Col N="1964"/>examine proposals for the reform of the existing Savings Protection Scheme  for credit unions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I received the correspondence dated 17 October 2006 and  have already acknowledged its receipt. A substantive reply, along the lines set out below, has also now been issued.  The position is that prior to the passing of the Finance Act, 1999, any person going on pension under a defined contribution scheme or a retirement annuity contract  was required to purchase an annuity with  any remaining pension fund moneys, following the drawdown of the appropriate tax-free lump sum.  The Finance Act, 1999 introduced changes which gave a significant degree of flexibility and personal choice to certain categories of individual in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans. These choices include the options to purchase an annuity, receive the balance of the fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) or to invest in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) or Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), depending on the circumstances. Proprietary directors, self-employed individuals and certain employees/directors in non-pensionable employment represent the categories of individual who can exercise these options in relation to their pension plans. </P>
        <P>While these flexible options for drawing down pension benefits are not available to members of employers&rsquo; defined contribution schemes (who are outside of the categories of individual described above) in respect of benefits derived from standard contributions to the schemes, the flexible options do apply as regards any Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) made by such members either to their main schemes or to separate AVC schemes. The flexible options also apply to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) introduced in the Finance Act, 2002 to create an alternative pension product which is flexible, portable and user-friendly.</P>
        <P>The question of extending the flexible options described above to the broad membership of defined contribution or defined benefit schemes, generally, is a complex matter and needs to be considered as part of the wider issue of pension and retirement provision in Ireland. In this regard, the Government is committed to the publication next year of a Green Paper on Pensions Policy. The Green Paper, into which my Department (among others) will have an input, will out<Col N="1965"/>line the major policy choices and challenges facing us in the pensions area and important issues such as the significant extension of flexible options for drawing down pension benefits are best left for consideration in that context.</P>

It is expected that offers of compensation in respect of most of the elements comprised in the claim will issue within the next few days but further information and clarification is still required in relation to a few remaining elements of the claim before these can be progressed further.

	<P>Tax relief for health expenses is allowable as a deduction against income at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal rate for annual expenses incurred in excess of  &euro;125 per person. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that data on health expenses incurred by  individuals where the total amount of expense falls below the threshold are not recorded centrally on Revenue tax records. There is, therefore, no statistical basis on which an estimate of the potential cost to the Exchequer of abolishing the <Col N="1966"/>threshold could be compiled in respect of these expenses.</P>
        <P>The cost to the Exchequer of abolishing the threshold in respect of claims where the total amount of qualifying expenses exceeds the threshold is estimated at &euro;9 million in a full year based on Revenue tax records of such claims for the income tax year 2003, the most recent year for which the relevant information is available.</P>

	<P>In Budget 2005, I announced a special stamp duty relief relating to an exchange of farm land between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer&rsquo;s holding. The relief is contained in section 121 of the Finance Act 2005 which provides that no stamp duty will be charged on an exchange of such lands where the lands are of equal value. In a case where the lands exchanged are not of equal value, stamp duty will only be charged on the amount of the difference in the value of the lands concerned.</P>
        <P>The scheme was introduced on 1 July 2005 for a period of 2 years.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that from 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2005 there were two cases of farm <Col N="1968"/>consolidation relief.  In 2006, from 1 January to 31 September there were 12 cases.</P>
        <P>At the Partnership talks earlier this year it was agreed to look at the possibility of extending this relief to cases where only one farmer is consolidating his/her farm holdings.  However, as was stated at the time, if such a measure was introduced, it would probably be subject to EU Commission approval.</P>

	<P>There are three significant financial elements of the sugar compensation package, as far as farmers, as sugar beet growers, are concerned. The first is an amount of &euro;123 million, payable over the next seven years via the single payment scheme, as compensation for the drop in the support price of beet. The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring aid. In July 2006 the Government decided that a sum of &euro;40m restructuring aid be reserved for beet growers. This decision has been challenged by the Irish sugar processor by way of Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court.  The third element is the diversification aid worth almost &euro;44m, which will be drawn down in the framework of a National Restructuring Programme to be prepared and submitted to the EU Commission by the end of this year.</P>

	<P>The Group thresholds, below which no Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is liable, are increased automatically each year according to the Consumer Price Index.  With regard to the exclusion of principal private residences from assessment, I assume the Deputy is referring to the gross assets test contained within CAT Agricultural Relief.  In order to qualify for Agricultural Relief, at least 80 per cent of the assets of a beneficiary of a gift or an inheritance, after taking the gift or inheritance, must consist of agricultural property, as defined in section 89(1) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003. The 80% test was designed to ensure that the relief applies to farmers and as such to exclude individuals with substantial non-agricultural assets from qualifying for the relief.</P>
        <P>If the principal private residence of the claimant is part of a farm, it will be considered as agricultural property for the purposes of the 80% test.  Where the claimant has a principal private residence that is unconnected to farming, this will be included in the 20% section of the test.  Capital Acquisitions Tax, along with all other taxes, are subject to review every year in the context of the annual Budget.</P>

        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />cost over &euro;200m over 5 years;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />when fully operational, result in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />meet a target of 2% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2008;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, and</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The level of excise relief available is that which had been proposed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in advance of last year&rsquo;s Budget and is regarded as a figure which is sufficient to match Ireland&rsquo;s output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the period of the scheme.  Opting for a Scheme where project applications are assessed in preference to a general blanket excise relief for biofuels ensures that projects chosen offer a greater degree of quality control to end-users and are best positioned to promote the long-term use of biofuels in the Irish market.</P>
        <P>As regards other fiscal supports for the Biofuels industry, I would point out that also in Budget 2006, I introduced a 50% VRT relief for flexible fuel vehicles.  These are defined as cars or small vans produced so as to be capable of using a blend of ethanol and petrol containing a minimum of 85% ethanol.  This should encourage the purchase of vehicles that have been manufactured with flexible fuel capabilities which will result in lower pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles fuelled exclusively by petrol/diesel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 251 together.</P>
        <P>The position is that traders making supplies in the State are obliged to register for VAT where certain turnover thresholds are exceeded or are likely to be exceeded in any continuous period of twelve months. However, businesses may if they wish opt to register for VAT where their turnover <Col N="1971"/>is below these thresholds. Businesses generally choose to register where they have a large input cost element to their turnover. It is important to note that VAT registered businesses are entitled to claim the VAT back on their expenses.</P>
        <P>Under EU law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, Member States may only increase thresholds in line with inflation.  The VAT registration thresholds for small businesses have been increased from &euro;25,500 to &euro;27,500 in the case of services (including Bed and Breakfast) and from &euro;51,000 to &euro;55,000 in the case of goods with effect from the 1 May 2006.  As a result some 2,200 businesses were removed from the VAT net reducing the administrative burden for small businesses.  The VAT registration thresholds were previously increased in 1994.</P>
        <P>While the VAT registration thresholds in the UK are higher than ours it has also to be noted that the VAT rate applied to the provision of such services in the UK is 4 percentage points higher than our own at 17.5% compared to 13.5% in Ireland. I would add that Ireland has the fifth highest registration thresholds for services in the EU. Indeed, some EU Member States have no registration thresholds at all.</P>
        <P>Any further consideration of the current thresholds would have to be balanced between the desirability of reducing the administrative burden on small businesses and the Revenue authorities and the need to avoid undermining tax compliance or causing competitive distortions.  Finally, it is not customary for me to comment on any possible tax changes which may or may not arise in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of tax collected on cigarettes was &euro;1,059 million in 2004 and &euro;1,079 million in 2005.  The position up to end October 2006 is that tax revenue on cigarettes is 1.3% above the corresponding period in 2005.  It is not possible to estimate how much revenue has been lost during 2004 and 2005 due to smuggling.  The number of cigarettes seized in 2004 and 2005 amounted to 60.9 million and 50.7 million respectively while seizures up to 30 September 2006 amounted to 39.7 million.  In many cases both the cigarette brands and the circumstances in which they were seized would, however, suggest that a significant portion of what was seized was intended for the UK market leading to the conclusion that the <Col N="1972"/>penetration of the domestic market by smuggled cigarettes is low.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, there has been a noticeable increase in the frequency and volume of cigarettes being seized from passengers and couriers arriving by air from Eastern Europe where prices are significantly lower than in Ireland.  This is a cause for concern as these cigarettes are intended for a certain segment of the Irish market.  This matter is being kept under review.  The number of convictions for cigarette smuggling was 49 in 2004, 102 in 2005 and 105 up to 30 September 2006.</P>

	<P>The Climate Change Strategy says that from 2002 onwards taxes will begin to take into account the amounts of greenhouse gases produced in any activity. It is indeed Government policy to take greenhouse gas emission into account when formulating or developing tax policy in any particular area.</P>
        <P>In September 2004, the Government decided not to introduce a specific carbon tax, following <Col N="1974"/>a thorough examination of the issues involved, including how a carbon tax would be implemented and the associated environmental, economic and social impacts.  In addition, my Department carried out an extensive consultation process in which 117 written submissions were received. Following this examination, the Government decided that a carbon tax was not an appropriate policy option and that, instead, it would intensify action on the other measures under the National Climate Change Strategy.</P>
        <P>The Government concluded that the environmental benefits of a carbon tax would not justify the difficulties that would arise, particularly for households, from the introduction of such a tax.  In this respect, the carbon energy tax would have imposed price increases on many products already suffering sharp increases, particularly as a result of increases in international oil prices.  While a carbon tax would have involved a range of compensatory measures, these would not fully address the adverse economic and social effects arising.  Moreover a carbon tax would apply to products which are in the main already subject to excise duties and where a new tax is not specifically necessary to increase tax rates.</P>
        <P>The carbon energy tax was just one possible element of the Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to which the Government remains fully committed.</P>
        <P>Taxation can play a part in attaining environment objectives.  However, as Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that in developing policy on tax measures we take into account any effects on Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy.  I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the Consumer Price Index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>
        <P>Apart from the carbon tax, the National Climate Change Strategy does envisage other initiatives in the tax area with one such example being tax reliefs for &ldquo;green initiatives&rdquo;.  Essentially this approach uses the tax system to provide incentives for certain behaviour.  Such incentives include the significant Biofuels excise relief scheme which I announced in the Budget and for which provision was made in Finance Act 2006. The scheme will:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;</P>

	<P>The search for the site for a Garda Station in Leixlip commenced in 1997.  In 1997, 2000, and 2002 ten sites, four sites and two sites were examined, respectively. All of the sixteen sites investigated were located within a reasonable distance from the centre of Leixlip, in line with OPW&rsquo;s understanding of Garda operation requirements but no suitable site was identified until a site at Station Road came to attention.  The acquisition of the site at Station Road, Leixlip was completed in October 2002.</P>
        <P>Following the acquisition of the site at Station Road the Garda accommodation requirements increased to reflect newly increased policing operations generally within the force.  Consequently OPW sought to acquire additional land adjacent to the Station Road site.  In May 2005 agreement was reached with Kildare County Council to transfer this plot of land to OPW.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform approved the revised sketch scheme and the Part 9 consultation began in December 2005.  Some 98 submissions were received in response to the Part 9 Notice and the Commissioners of Public Works appointed an independent assessor to consider the submissions.  In September 2006 the Commissioners made a formal decision to proceed with <Col N="1976"/>the construction of the Station.  The tendering process will commence shortly. It is expected that works will commence on site early next year and that the building will be completed mid 2008.</P>

	<P>The current minimum wage is &euro;7.65 per hour.  On an annualised basis, this is equivalent to &euro;15,515 assuming a 39 hour working week.  The present entry point to income tax under the PAYE system is &euro;15,600 per annum for a single person under 65.  The position is, therefore, that no employee who benefits from entitlement to the employee (PAYE) tax credit in addition to the basic personal tax credit will be subjected to income tax in 2006.  However, a small number of persons with income at or below the current minimum wage annualised who do not have entitlement to the employee tax credit are likely to be liable for a small amount of income tax in 2006.  This group comprises, in the main, proprietary directors.</P>

        <Quest> the cost of achieving the target in 2007 that only 20% of persons in the income tax net would pay tax at the 42% rate; and the value of the standard rate cut-off point which would then apply for single, one parent, married one earner, and married two earner families. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is estimated that of the 2.16 million taxpayers on the tax record, just under 36% are exempt from tax as low earners, 32% have their tax computed at a marginal rate of 20% and just under 32% have a computed marginal rate of 42%.  If one looks, however, at effective tax rates actually paid by taxpayers, there are many who are nominally liable at the higher rate of tax but who effectively pay tax at no more than they would at the standard rate of tax.  It is estimated that, allowing for <Col N="1977"/>this effect, the latest data indicate that for 2006 about 80% of income earners pay tax at no more than the standard rate.  Put another way, tax credits fully offset the 42% liability in the case of all but about 20% of income earners.  For 2007, allowing for wages growth and before any Budget day changes, it is estimated that around 77% of income earners would actually pay tax at no more than the 20% rate.  The cost of bridging the remaining 3% gap will vary depending on the <Col N="1978"/>extent to which bands and credits are increased in value.  As the Deputy will be aware, it has been the practice of successive Ministers for Finance not to comment on what may or may not be contained in upcoming Budgets and I do not intend to depart from this approach on this occasion.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Many income earners pay no tax at all; many pay tax at a standard rate but pay a much lower average rate because of the application of credits.  And for many taxpayers who are, strictly speaking, liable for tax at the higher rate on part of their income, the amount of their liability at the higher rate is fully offset by their tax credits.  In fact, tax credits fully offset the 42% liability in the case of all but about 20% of all income earners.  Effectively, therefore, many of the &ldquo;top rate&rdquo; taxpayers actually pay at an average rate of 20% or less.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have any record of receipt of the letter of 4 July 2006, a copy of which was supplied with the question.  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that rent relief claims, in accordance with section 473, of the Taxes Consolidation <Col N="1978"/>Act 1997, were received in Sligo District for the person in question on 14 February 2006.  The rent relief claims related to the tax years 2002 to 2005 inclusive and, on the basis of the information furnished in the letter accompanying the claims, it was understood that tax relief at source for home loan interest had been granted. Since simultaneous claims for rent relief and home loan interest cannot be allowed, a letter in response to the claims was issued on 24 February 2006 advising the person that the rent relief claims would not be allowed.</P>
        <P>On a review of the position it has emerged that the person in question has not received, and may not have claimed, tax relief in respect of home loan interest.  Accordingly, Sligo District is arranging to contact the person in question to clarify the position as to what, if any, tax relief is due in respect of home loan interest or rent paid.</P>

	<P>I am fully committed to the development of high quality and quality assured cancer care for all patients regardless of geography.  Outcomes for patients is what drives our policy and investment in cancer care.  This objective is shared by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and is reflected in the Executive&rsquo;s National Service Plan, 2006.  There has been significant investment in cancer care in the North West since 1997.  Additional medical Consultants have been appointed in the region in key areas of cancer care, including medical oncology, surgery, histopathology, haematology and palliative care.  Over twenty cancer care nurse specialists have been appointed. </P>
        <P>Last June the HSE concluded its review of options for the future provision of breast care services for Donegal.  The HSE decided to develop breast care services within a framework that merges the Specialist Breast Care Unit at University College Hospital Galway (UCHG) with that at Letterkenny General Hospital (LGH).  The HSE intends to appoint a permanent breast surgeon who will be primarily based at LGH with sessions at UCHG.</P>
        <P>I have met with representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of my wish to have a quality assured programme rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible. BreastCheck is confident that the target <Col N="1982"/>date of next year for the commencement of roll out to the Western and Southern regions will be met.</P>
        <P>Last May I officially opened an 11 bed oncology ward at LGH.  The development is supported by an oncology day case area, breast care suite and a clean air pharmaceutical preparation room.  The provision of a 30 bed modular short stay ward at LGH has been announced and this project will be funded from the A &amp; E initiative monies.  A new purpose built Emergency Department and 12 bay Medical Assessment Unit is currently in design stage.  The capital plan announced by the HSE includes provision for additional ward space over the proposed new Emergency Department.  This has been incorporated into the overall Emergency Department project.</P>
        <P>At the last meeting of the British-Irish Inter Governmental Council on 24 October 2006, it was announced that agreement has been reached for the referral of about 50 radiation oncology patients annually from Donegal to Belfast City Hospital.  It has also been agreed that the number will be increased if there is sufficient demand from patients in Donegal.  The first referral clinic is scheduled to take place tomorrow.</P>
        <P>The HSE is committed to supporting the travel needs of patients in Donegal referred to BCH. and currently provides a range of transport services for patients who require radiation oncology treatment.  At the request of my Department, the HSE is to examine existing transport arrangements and develop a national integrated plan for the delivery of dedicated transport services for radiation oncology patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I should explain at the outset that the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive (HSE) administers the supplementary welfare scheme on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It has now been decided to transfer the scheme, together with associated resources, to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  My colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and I believe that this presents an opportunity to bring about positive change for social welfare customers while advancing the Health Reform Programme. </P>
        <P>The wider welfare role undertaken by Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) includes information provision, advocacy and referral to services provided not just by the HSE but also by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, local authorities, F&Aacute;S, MABS, Community Information Centres and a range of other bodies.  It is not necessary for CWOs to be employed by the HSE in order to carry out this wider welfare role as the role is broader than liaising with for example, personal social services professionals on behalf of clients.  It also extends to other Government services to combat social exclusion such as employment and training opportunities.</P>
        <P>Agencies other than the HSE also have a welfare role and work with statutory and non-statutory bodies where appropriate to promote participation and social inclusion.  Transferring the Community Welfare Service to the Department of Social and Family Affairs will maximise CWOs&rsquo; wider welfare role by enhancing their ability to provide an effective service to their customers both in terms of their immediate income needs and their wider welfare while working with their colleagues in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and in other bodies.</P>
        <P>The background to this decision is that the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service (the Brennan Report) noted that, over the years, the health system had been assigned responsibility for a number of what might be regarded as non-core health activities.  It recommended that the Government consider assigning non-core activities currently undertaken by agencies within the health service to other bodies.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental group was subsequently established to examine this issue.  The Group&rsquo;s report (Core Functions of the Health Service Report) was submitted to, and accepted by, the Government in February 2006.  Among other recommendations, the Group considered that income support and maintenance schemes administered by the HSE, together with associated resources, should be transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I should also mention that this approach had been advocated previously in the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 and in the Review of Sup<Col N="1986"/>plementary Welfare Allowances by the Combat Poverty Agency in 1991.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental group is now working to progress the implementation of the transfer.  As indicated by the Deputy, CWOs have an important role in addressing cases of immediate and urgent need.  I am confident, along with my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, that this transfer process can be carried out without any negative effect on the standard of service currently provided by CWOs, or in the important role that they play in addressing issues of disadvantage in the community.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 to 291, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the 5th Annual Report of the Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) which is comprehensive and provides an important overview of the services provided to children in residential care.</P>
        <P>The emphasis of the Child Care Act, 1991 is on supporting children and families in their own communities having regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of the child to be brought up in his or her own family.  However, children are taken into the care of the Health Service Executive or placed voluntarily in care due to a range of family circumstances and the Health Service Executive has a statutory responsibility to provide appropriate services for these children.  Children are placed in foster care or relative care, or in residential care, by the Health Service Executive, in accordance with the Child Care Regulations, 1995, which set out the requirements to be complied with by the HSE when placing children in care.</P>
        <P>Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children who cannot, for a number of reasons, be looked after in their own home.  My Department and the Health Service Executive have placed considerable emphasis on the further development and strengthening of the foster care service for children in need of alternative care.  However, foster care placements may not always meet the specific needs of individual children and it may therefore be necessary to place these children in residential care.</P>
        <P>Children&rsquo;s residential centres include community based centres which are small centres based in local communities, high support units which are open units offering more intensive levels of care for children with assessed difficulties and special care units which are secure residential facilities for young people aged between 12 and <Col N="1990"/>17 years who are detained under court order for their own safety and welfare.  The criteria used in the determination of care placements is a matter for the Health Service Executive, whose staff work directly with the children and their families.  I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to this matter.</P>
        <P>Having completed a full round of inspections of approximately 90 statutory children&rsquo;s residential centres in 2004, the SSI were able to focus inspection resources in 2005 on selected areas with a view to improving outcomes for services that were identified as experiencing specific challenges.  This helps to explain why this report has more critical findings than perhaps other reports have had.  The SSI focused on two themed inspections.  The emergence of the Health Service Executive (HSE) as a national body facilitated a national themed inspection of the management of behaviour in high support units (HSU&rsquo;s).  A cluster inspection of children&rsquo;s residential centres in the former South Western Area Health Board (SWAHB) was also conducted after a number of previous inspections had given rise to concerns about the quality of care provided in this former health board area.  The SSI also conducted its annual inspection of the two Special Care Units, focusing on the standards that had been the subject of concern in previous inspections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The focus of the inspections of the HSU&rsquo;s was on their capacity to manage the behaviour of the young people safely and well.  A total of 56 children were accommodated in the units at the time of inspection.  The inspections identified the factors which contribute to young people's behaviours being well managed.  These include good management, a clear statement of purpose and function, an agreed model of care that is understood by the care staff team, a good standard of primary care and last but not least, respect for the rights of the young people.  While many of the units were providing a good standard of care, inspectors identified a number of areas where improvements were required and made a number of recommendations in this regard.  The SSI will be monitoring the implementation of these recommendations.</P>
        <P>The cluster inspection of children&rsquo;s residential centres in the former SWAHB was conducted between September 2005 and January 2006.  As the report states, a cluster inspection facilitates the identification of common issues that may be best addressed at a regional or national level.  Between them, the thirteen centres inspected accommodated 43 children at the time of inspection.  Arising from the inspections, recommendations were made in relation to the services&rsquo; review process, the purpose and function of centres, policies and procedures, management and staffing, monitoring, care practices, children&rsquo;s rights, care planning, planning for aftercare, and accommodation.  The report acknowledges that <Col N="1991"/>the former SWAHB had the second largest concentration of children&rsquo;s residential centres in the country and did not have the management resources of areas with fewer centres or better community resources.  It is inequities such as this that the HSE, with its national remit can address.  Indeed the report acknowledges the significant progress made by this region since the inspection in addressing the deficiencies highlighted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am pleased to say that in relation to the two special care units in the country, the SSI conducted their annual inspection in 2005 and found that both were meeting the standards.  In fact the report states that the children in both units spoke highly of the care they received and the relationships between the staff and children were described as warm and respectful.</P>
        <P>Whilst there have been clear improvements over the last few years areas of concern still remain and I in no way want to minimise the seriousness of these issues.  However, it is only when we openly acknowledge the problems that exist that we can begin to work to find solutions to these problems.  Many of the more serious difficulties clearly stemmed from inequities in the services and as I have already stated the move away from regional health boards to the establishment of the HSE with its national remit for services is key to addressing such inequities.  It must also be remembered that the Report deals with inspections that were conducted last year and the SSI have already been back to the centres on follow up visits.  Some of the centres have since been closed by the HSE and recommendations have been implemented by the HSE in relation to others.  The SSI will continue to monitor the implementation of the recommendations and I am confident that with the ongoing cooperation of the HSE the services provided for the children in these centres can be brought into line with the required standards.</P>

	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility.</P><Col N="1994"/>
        <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month, or approximately &euro;20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the question refers to the charging of people with intellectual disabilities in long stay care.</P>
        <P>The charging for long stay care under the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005 is being implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005. These Regulations were signed on 14 June 2005 and reinstated charges for in-patient services and provided for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of in-patient services.  The Regulations were prepared following extensive consultation with the HSE and others.</P>
        <P>Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, (as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005) provides, inter alia, for the levying of a charge where in-patient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months.</P>
        <P>In this regard, charging of patients in long-term care commenced on 14 July 2005, which was after the expiration of 30 days after the Regulations were signed.</P>
        <P>The Regulations, in keeping with Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Class 1</i></P>
        <P>Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser.</P><Col N="1996"/>
<?oasys _fc ?>
          <P el="10"><i>Class 2</i></P>
        <P>Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;. Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to a specific case that involves the management and delivery of health and personal social services and which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy in relation to this case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993  provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds.  General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993, as amended by the Nursing Homes (Subvention)(Amendment) Regulations 2005.  </P>
        <P>There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum and these rates apply in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>Under the Regulations, when considering an application for subvention, the Health Service Executive carries out a means test which takes into account the means (including assets) of the applicant and his or her spouse/cohabiting partner, where appropriate.  The HSE may impute an income of 5% of the estimated market value of <Col N="1997"/>the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, regardless of market value, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or son or daughter aged less than twenty one years or in full time education or in receipt of certain social welfare pension/allowances and generally does so unless there are exceptional circumstances. The Regulations provide that the HSE may refuse to pay a subvention if the value of the applicant&rsquo;s principal residence is in excess of &euro;500,000 (where the residence is located in the Dublin area) or &euro;300,000 (where the residence is located outside the Dublin area) and the applicant has an income of at least &euro;9,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted.  The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004.  The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on nursing home fees for example.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006. The additional &euro;20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to subventions support throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. It was prepared on a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; basis. In addition, national guidelines on nursing home subvention are currently being developed by the HSE to ensure an even and equitable application of the regulations nationally.</P>
        <P>The Government is currently considering new policy on Long Term Care and several principles underlying this were agreed with the social partners in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;. These principles include, for example, that there should be one standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised.  Sheltered housing options will be encouraged.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility. The financial model to support any new arrangements must also be financially sustainable.</P><Col N="1998"/>
        <P>The Department is currently drawing up proposals for the Government&rsquo;s consideration based on the principles in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.  </P>
        <P>As I recently advised the Deputy, the Group in question has been provisionally approved capital funding of &euro;1.4 million under the EOCP in respect of a proposal to develop a childcare facility.  This funding is approved subject to the Group concluding a satisfactory contractual agreement with Pobal, which is engaged to <Col N="2002"/>administer the grants on behalf of the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>Following my meeting with the Group in June 2006 to discuss the amount of capital funding provisionally approved in line with the programme criteria, I understand from enquiries I have made that revised plans for the proposal have been submitted by the Group to Pobal and that discussions are continuing with a view to bringing the project to contract.  However I understand that, to date, the Group has not submitted a formal request for further EOCP funding of their capital project.</P>

	<P>The expertise and professional commitment of the staff at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will continue to be <Col N="2006"/>an essential element in the development of cancer care.  The decision to transfer this resource was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.</P>
        <P>In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke&rsquo;s are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  Medical and scientific experts from the hospital are involved in developing the output specifications for the delivery of new radiation oncology services nationally.  The Chief Executive at St. Luke&rsquo;s will lead the management team of the new facility at St. James&rsquo;s.  I also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke&rsquo;s to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group to advise me on progress on the implementation of the plan.</P>
        <P>I have approved the provision of two additional linear accelerators at St. Luke&rsquo;s to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the national plan.  I expect these services to commence late next year.  I also recently announced the approval of two radiation oncology facilities at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, comprising of two linear accelerators and associated treatment planning at each site, to be delivered in early 2009.  These are key elements of the delivery of the National Plan.</P>

        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme, which is part of Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s Low Income Housing Programme, aims to improve the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of homes occupied by low-income households. The scheme provides funding to community-based organisations for the installation of energy efficiency measures including attic insulation, draught proofing, hot water cylinder insulation and cavity wall insulation (in some areas, and where technically appropriate), in homes in their respective localities. The scheme is intended to benefit those who need it most and the eligibility criteria vary from <Col N="2010"/>region to region, depending on the target group of the community organisation in question.</P>
        <P>There are 15 community-based organisations that are approved for funding to complete homes in 2006. The service is available in Dublin, Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Westmeath, Roscommon, Cork, Kerry, Wexford, Cavan, Limerick and Leitrim.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to developing domestic scale renewable electricity and heat technologies. Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has undertaken work on Metering Options for Small Scale Renewable and CHP Electricity Generation. The study identified a number of areas which require further analysis including the ability of such processes to secure adequate payment for their exports, a review of connection standards and processes for smaller generators, and the implications of the Single Electricity Market for small-scale electricity generation.</P>
        <P>These technical and administrative issues are currently being addressed, and my Department is working with the relevant agencies, including SEI, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), ESB Networks and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland in this regard.</P>
        <P>As part of the ongoing work to progress this area, the CER launched a public consultation in early October on arrangements for micro generation which deals with metering issues.</P>
        <P>We are working to ensure that the appropriate administrative, technical and safety standards and practices are in place to underpin programmes for the widespread deployment of micro generation technologies. I am confident that appropriate solutions suited to the context of the Irish electricity grid and for non-grid connected technologies will be developed with a view to progressing this emerging sector.</P>

	<P>Since my reply of 6 December 2005, the protections afforded by the Civil Service anti-harassment, sexual harassment and bullying policy, A Positive Working Environment, have been extended to all unestablished employees at diplomatic missions abroad. A Departmental circular to this effect was issued in late December 2005. It provides for: </P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />formal and informal procedures for the handling of complaints of harassment, sexual harassment and bullying;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the possibility of mediation, where appropriate;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />action where a complaint is upheld;</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />action where a complaint is not upheld;</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />and, review procedures where the complainant is not satisfied with the conduct or outcome of the investigation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition to the above protections and procedures, a separate Departmental circular covering grievances in the workplace was issued in late December 2005. It provides a process for locally recruited employees at missions abroad to have work related grievances (other than pay and related matters) dealt with. The circular details full procedures for dealing with grievances in the workplace, including the possibility of mediation, and an appeal mechanism.</P>
        <P>A disciplinary code for locally recruited employees at diplomatic missions abroad was also introduced in late December 2005. The purpose of the code is to ensure that all locally recruited members of staff at Irish missions abroad are dealt with in a fair and equitable manner in relation to disciplinary matters. The code provides a transparent disciplinary procedure, including an appeal mechanism.</P>
        <P>The two circulars and disciplinary code referred to above were issued, in translation where appropriate, by Heads of Mission to all locally recruited employees at missions abroad in late December 2005. They were re-circulated to all missions abroad in September of this year.</P>
        <P>As regards the Labour Court&rsquo;s expression of concern that no formal mechanism exists for locally recruited staff in Irish Missions abroad to pursue grievances with regard to pay, grade and related matters, the Department is close to completing a review of best practice among other EU Member States. Once this review is complete, the Department expects to be in a position to formulate a new procedure to address this issue.</P><Col N="2015"/>

      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Based on this identification and estimate, to make recommendations for the future provision of services to overseas prisoners, taking into account the services available in comparable countries.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I understand that the study is at an advanced stage, and that a significant number of organisations have been consulted. I look forward to receiving the completed report in due course from Mr. Flood.</P>

	<P>On 21 September 2006 I received an invitation from Carlos Coelho, Chairman of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, inviting me to attend one of the Temporary Committee&rsquo;s meetings.</P>
        <P>In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s policy of full co-operation with the European Parliament in its investigation into this matter, I replied to Mr Coelho stating that I was very happy to accept his invitation. In my reply I also indicated my intention to appear before the end of November. It remains my expectation that I will do so, though I also drew the Committee&rsquo;s attention to the possible demands of the Northern Ireland situation during this month. Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the European Parliament remain in close contact on the matter.</P>
        <P>I have repeatedly made clear the Government&rsquo;s total opposition to the practice of so-called extraordinary rendition and to any form of illegal detention of prisoners. I have also emphasised the Government&rsquo;s determination to continue our full co-operation with the investigations into these matters being conducted by both the European Parliament and the Council of Europe.</P>
        <P>The European Parliament hearings will provide the Government with another opportunity to reiterate our outright condemnation of such practices and to assure the European Parliament of our full support for the Temporary Committee&rsquo;s mandate.</P>

	<P>Following his receipt and analysis of the Member States&rsquo; responses to his Article 52 questionnaire, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr Terry Davis, has submitted a number of proposals to Member States on ways in which they should reinforce the protection of human rights.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General&rsquo;s proposed measures include drawing up minimum standards to prevent human rights abuses by security services, in particular foreign security services active on the territory of a Council of Europe member <Col N="2017"/>state, mechanisms to enforce existing human rights obligations with respect to transiting aircraft, and a legal instrument permitting diplomatic immunity to be waived in cases of serious human rights violations.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General sent these proposals to Member States on 4 July 2006. In early September, the Committee of Ministers took note of the Secretary General&rsquo;s proposals and agreed to resume consideration of them at one of its forthcoming meetings. Ireland has welcomed the Secretary General&rsquo;s initiative. It is our firm view that for the Secretary General&rsquo;s proposals to be effective, action will require to be taken on a Europe-wide basis.</P>

        <P>Through the bi-annual EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, the most recent round of which was held in Beijing on 19 October, the EU, expressing its concern at the high number of human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists in prison, urged China not to harass or punish individuals exercising their right to freedom of expression in a peaceful manner. The Dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises human rights issues and concerns with China. Equally, over a number of years, the EU has pressed the Chinese authorities to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which contains provisions on freedom of expression.</P>
        <P>Ireland continues to raise its human rights concerns in its relations with China, where most recently the official visit to Ireland Chinese Vice-Premier Zeng Peiyan in September afforded an opportunity for the T&aacute;naiste to convey our concerns to the Vice-Premier bilaterally. For my part, I took the opportunity to raise human rights issues and concerns, including the importance we attach to freedom of speech and religion, when I met with Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr. Li Zhaoxing, during a visit to Beijing in May.</P>

        <P>The Sports Council provides funding to recognised National Governing Bodies (NGB) of sport including Special Olympics Ireland. NGBs are dealt with as autonomous organisations and grants are allocated under agreed funding conditions and with specific priorities in mind. The grant allocation process is run on an annual basis by the Sports Council, with NGBs submitting an application form covering their programmes for the coming year. I recognise the extensive benefits which accrue to persons with intellectual disabilities through the sporting and social activities provided by Special Olympics Ireland. Since 1999, Special Olympics Ireland has received over &euro;4 million in funding from the Sports Council with grants of  &euro;596,473 in 2006.  Special Olympics Ireland has made a submission to the Government on the development and funding of the Special Olympics Programme and this submission  is being considered.</P>

	<P>There is no compulsory retirement age in employments rights legislation. Generally such legislation describes an employee as &ldquo; a person of any age who has entered into or works under (or, where the employment has ceased, entered into or worked under) a contract of employment . . .&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In some employments, a &ldquo;normal retirement age&rdquo; exists for that employment only.  In such cases, the normal age of retirement tends to be below 65 years of age but can be above that, thus giving flexibility to employers and employees, having due regard to the nature of the work being <Col N="2022"/>performed.  Any proposed change to the normal retirement age should first be negotiated between employee and employer.</P>
        <P>Terms and conditions of employment, including proposed changes to such terms and conditions, are determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the employers and employees or their representatives. The State facilitates the bargaining process by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper. Institutions are in place that can assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers such as the Labour Relations Commission, including its Rights Commissioner Service, and the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>Disputes that arise in relation to provisions in contracts of employment may concern matters of contract law.  Advice on contract law, if required, should be obtained from a legal professional.</P>

	<P>On the 26th of April 2006, the Labour Court made a recommendation regarding the redundancy terms for Irish Sugar workers at the Mallow plant.  The recommendation provided that redundancy should be 5 weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service, where a week&rsquo;s pay would be defined as actual finishing salary, excluding overtime, plus <Col N="2023"/>statutory redundancy entitlement, plus a bonus payment for an orderly wind-down.  The Court issued two clarifications in May, but these failed to achieve a resolution to the dispute.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court invited the parties to return to the Court with a view to resolving the dispute. However, the company rejected the Court&rsquo;s invitation. I very much regret the decision taken by the company in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court issued a third clarification of its Recommendation on the 17th of October 2006. The company has indicated that it is not prepared to alter its offer.  Similarly, the trade unions have not changed their position and are not prepared to accept the company&rsquo;s existing offer.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Minister Miche&aacute;l Martin, has met with representatives of both the trade unions and the company and urged them to resolve their differences and to avail of the dispute settling machinery of the State, as necessary.  I have also met with union representatives to discuss this matter. The National Implementation Body has also worked with the parties concerned to seek to identify an agreed procedure to resolve the issue in dispute.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.</P>
        <P>Where the Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal in trade disputes, its recommendations are not enforceable.  In such cases, the Court hears both sides and then issues a recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled.  While these recommendations are not binding on the parties concerned, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the Court&rsquo;s recommendation.  As the Labour Court is a Court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and, consequently, are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, namely, the Labour Court recommendation.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the recently approved EU Commission Regional Aid map for Ireland; the effects this map will have on north Tipperary; his further views on whether the approval further degrades the emphasis placed on north Tipperary as an attractive location by the job creation agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Given Ireland&rsquo;s economic performance since the current Regional Aid Map was approved by the European Commission in 1999, it was to be expected that our scope to designate areas for regional aid for 2007-2013 would be significantly reduced.  The European Commission initially proposed that only the Border, Midlands and West Region, representing 26.5% of the country&rsquo;s population, would be designated for regional aid for 2007-2013.  However, Ireland successfully negotiated scope to designate areas covering 50% of the population.</P>
        <P>In selecting the areas within the Southern and Eastern Region which could, in addition to the BMW Region, be designated for the new regional aid map, Ireland had to observe a strict EU requirement that the areas selected be relatively more in need of economic development.  Accordingly, I consulted the Southern &amp; Eastern Regional Assembly for their views.  The Assembly accepted the findings of an independent report, which it commissioned, from the National Institute for Spatial and Regional Analysis, at NUI Maynooth.  The Assembly&rsquo;s proposals were included in the proposed Regional Aid Map which the European Commission has now approved.</P>
        <P>Under the new map, North Tipperary will retain entitlement to regional aid from 2007-2013.  The maximum aid rates will be 30% for small firms and 20% for medium-sized firms.  Large firms will permitted an aid rate of 10% until end 2008.  Apart from the BMW region, no other part of Ireland will be permitted higher aid rates during these periods.   While I am satisfied that North Tipperary, and Ireland as a whole, has achieved a very good outcome under the Regional Aid Map for 2007-2013, the role of regional aid in attracting foreign investment should not be exaggerated.  Such globally significant decisions are founded on a variety of elements.  Factors such as the availability of skilled labour, modern infrastructure and a flexible regulatory environment are of fundamental importance to potential investors.  IDA Ireland is constantly innovating by <Col N="2025"/>adapting and changing the value proposition it offers its clients.  This means exploring new areas and strategies, improving Ireland&rsquo;s physical and digital infrastructure and, most importantly, investing in people through education and, in particular, research funding.  IDA Ireland remains committed to regional development as a core part of its strategy and is constantly working with relevant national and local partners to develop and build the infrastructure necessary to make regional locations attractive for international business.</P>
        <P>I would also like to point out that, regardless of the Regional Aid Map, all parts of Ireland will continue to enjoy potentially significant financial supports for research and development and training initiatives.  They will also remain eligible for a range of non-financial supports.  All such supports are designed to drive on-going company growth by ensuring success in overseas markets, increased competitiveness and productivity and enhanced R&amp;D and innovative capabilities.  These are the factors which will drive company success and ultimately ensure overall job creation.</P>

	<P>The primary purpose of CE is to provide short-term work experience and training opportunities for long-term unemployed persons and other disadvantaged groups with a view to facilitating their progression to work in the open labour market.</P>
        <P>Community Employment has two categories of participants, Part-time Integration Option and Part-time Job Option, each option having its own set of qualifying conditions and the main conditions are set out below.</P>
        <P>The main qualifying condition for the Part-time Integration option is for a person to be 25 years or over and in receipt of specified payments from Department of Social and Family Affairs including Unemployment Benefit (UB) or Unemployment Assistance (UA) for 12 months or more.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Part-time Job Option the main qualifying condition is for a person to be between 35 years of age and 65 years of age and in receipt of specified payments from Department of Social and Family Affairs including Unemployment Benefit (UB) or Unemployment Assistance (UA) for 3 years or more.</P>
        <P>In certain circumstances, persons aged 18 years or over may also participate on CE if they meet the relevant eligibility criteria such as being in receipt of Disability Allowance or Blind Pension.</P><Col N="2026"/>
        <P>Having completed 12 months participation on CE a person must normally be on the Live Register for a further 12 months before recommencing CE participation.</P>
        <P>As part of the restructuring of CE approved in 1999, future participation in CE by an individual was capped at 3 years, effective from April, 2000. This measure was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through CE, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity to avail of the programme.  However, depending on the circumstances, F&Aacute;S may approve additional time on a scheme in order to address the needs of individual participants or to maintain service provision.</P>
        <P>Following a review of policy on the operation of Employment Programmes, from 10 November 2004 those aged 55 years of age and over are eligible to participate on CE for a maximum period of 6 years, based on participation since 3rd April 2000.</P>
        <P>More recently, in July of this year my Department published its Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, 2005.  One of the key initiatives of this Plan is to increase participation rates of people with disabilities on CE over the period of the Plan and to raise the CE participation limits for people with disabilities, in order to provide additional training to assist progression to employment:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />For people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit has been raised by one year from 3 to 4 years</P>

	<P>On being made redundant, an employee is entitled to receive two weeks notice of the date of termination of his/her employment. He/She would also be entitled to notice or pay in lieu of notice under the provisions of the Minimum Notice and Term of Employment Act 1973 if, depending on length of service, he/she is entitled to longer than two weeks notice. Both notices can run concurrently.</P>
        <P>On date of termination of employment, an employee should receive his/her statutory redundancy lump sum based on age, length of service in the employment and gross weekly pay at the time he/she is declared redundant i.e. at the time notice is given. He/She should also receive a copy of form RP50 that shows the calculation of his/her statutory redundancy lump sum payment.</P>
        <P>At the present time, the statutory rate of redundancy is two weeks pay per year of service plus one extra week&rsquo;s pay at the gross rate of pay up to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.</P>
        <P>If an employee is due holidays at the time he/she is made redundant, he/she is entitled to all outstanding holiday pay accrued  to date of termination of employment with his/her final week&rsquo;s pay.</P>

        <Quest> the cost of crediting homemakers&rsquo; work in the social insurance system by changing the disregards in the homemakers scheme into credits, and making them retrospective; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme which was introduced from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</P>
        <P>The scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the appropriate rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, a person who cannot satisfy the basic requirements outlined above or whose contribution record is based solely on modified contributions, payable in the public service, cannot benefit from the scheme.</P>
        <P>Because the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme only covers caring periods from 1994, it is not yet a factor in determining eligibility for social welfare pensions. In the circumstances, it is difficult to say what the cost implications of changing the basis of assessment to credits will be or when they are likely to arise.</P>
        <P>Back-dating the scheme could benefit women in two ways. Those who are currently receiving a reduced rate pension could see their payment increase while it might also assist those who are currently outside the social welfare pension system to receive a payment.  It is difficult to estimate the cost of this improvement but my Department considers it could be in the range of &euro;110 to &euro;220 million.   A proportion of the additional cost would involve improvements in the level of payments to people who are already on reduced rate contributory pensions.</P>
        <P>A review of the homemakers scheme and other issues relating to social welfare pensions is taking place in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions, to which the Government is committed as part of the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  At this stage it is <Col N="2032"/>planned to publish the Green Paper by the end of March next year.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy later next year.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The social welfare system comprises two types of pension; contributory pensions based on social insurance contributions and non-contributory pensions, payment of which are subject to a means test. The maximum contributory pension is paid at a slightly higher rate; however, the main advantage of contributory pensions is that they are paid regardless of any other income a person might have.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the state (contributory) pension a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record.  The scheme also features a range of reduced rate pensions, which are designed to ensure that the contributions people have made to the social insurance fund receive appropriate recognition. The range of reduced payments has been expanded over the years to allow more people to qualify for a contributory pension.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-contributory pensions, the new state pension (non-contributory) was introduced in September and replaces the old age (non-contributory) pension and, for recipients aged 66 and over, blind pension, widow/er&rsquo;s pension, one parent family payment, deserted wife&rsquo;s allowance and prisoner&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>The non-contributory scheme is a social assistance measure which is intended to provide a basic income to those with no, or very limited, means.  Qualification is based on a person satisfying a means test and the rate of payment depends on the level of means which are assessed. At present the rate of payment can, depending on means, range from a maximum of &euro;182 per week to as low as &euro;4.50 per week.</P>
        <P>As already indicated, the main advantage of the contributory over the non-contributory payment is that it is paid regardless of other means. It is, of course, open to those on reduced rate contributory pensions to apply for a non-con<Col N="2034"/>tributory pension and their means would be assessed to determine the level of pension to which they would be entitled.  If this rate is higher than the rate of contributory pension to which they are entitled then the contributory pension would be discontinued in favour of the higher rate pension.</P>

        <P>The Public Appointments Service (PAS) established the Central Applications Facility (CAF) through which all applications for decentralising locations must be submitted.  According to figures received in my Department from the CAF, the number of first preference applicants for Buncrana is 34.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agreed protocol for the recruitment of staff for these positions is that first preference priority applicants on CAF will receive an offer for their preferred first location. Where there is a shortfall in numbers, officers who have selected Buncrana as a second or subsequent preference and have applied on the CAF prior to 7 September 2004 will be given the opportunity to change this to their first preference.  Applicants who applied after the September 2004 deadline will be considered subsequently.  It is therefore not possible to say at this stage how many people will eventually exercise the option to go to Buncrana. The CAF will remain open for new applications until the full decentralisation programme is complete.</P>

	<P>People on a qualifying non-contributory pension or other social welfare payment are normally eligible for a fuel allowance without further means test, subject to the other conditions <Col N="2035"/>for entitlement.  Other applicant households may have a combined income of up to &euro;51.00 above the current maximum weekly contributory old age pension rate, and still qualify for a fuel allowance.  Based on this formula, the current upper limit income for fuel allowance eligibility is &euro;244.30 for a single applicant or &euro;373.10 for a couple, with further additions if there are any qualified dependent children, or if the applicant is over 80 years of age.</P>
        <P>The fuel allowance income limit increases each winter season in line with the reference rate of state pension (contributory).  On this basis, there have been significant real increases in the income limits for fuel allowance applicants in recent years.  This situation will continue automatically in future seasons, in line with prevailing pension rates.</P>
        <P>Any changes to the fuel allowance scheme such as rates of payment, income limits or eligibility would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.  Announcement of any changes of this kind would have to await publication of the budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 and 391 together.</P>
        <P>Where couples are actively engaged in a commercial enterprise as a business partnership, they are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are liable to social insurance contributions accordingly.  These contributions enable them to build up an insurance record in their own right and to receive the accruing benefits.  This would apply equally to married couples.</P>
        <P>In situations where the common business is incorporated as a limited company, each of the couple involved in the business can establish a PRSI record either as employees or as self-employed contributors &mdash; depending on whether a contract of service exists or not. Again, this is equally relevant to couples working together who are married.</P>
        <P>However, where a person is in a marital-type relationship and working for the other in a common business, be it casually or on a more ongoing basis, the question as to whether PRSI Class A contributions would be due &mdash; as an employee &mdash; would depend on whether a contract of service exists.  A contract of service implies that the worker is subject to direction, control and dismissal and brings with it rights, obligations and responsibilities on both sides.  If it is determined that a contract of service exists, then, in general, Class A PRSI would be the appropriate class.</P>
        <P>If a contract of service does not exist, there is scope for the activity to be considered to be a contract for services, with each of those in the business to be considered to be self-employed and insurable at PRSI Class S.  By contrast, where a person is employed under a contract of service (i.e. as an employee) by his or her spouse, the employment is specifically excluded from PRSI liability and the worker is viewed as an &lsquo;excepted&rsquo; contributor under social welfare legislation.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that where formal employment or partnership relationships are intended between spouses, or couples in a marital-type relationship, the legislation provides the scope necessary, as outlined above, to allow parties to enter into arrangements that will enable them to gain access to social insurance coverage.</P>

	<P>Decisions regarding the location and operation of taxi ranks on public roads are matters for consideration by the relevant local authority.  Under section 84 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as substituted by section 15 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, a local authority is empowered to make bye-laws in respect of any specified area in its functional area appointing the places at which taxis may stand for hire.  The making of such bye-laws is a reserved function of a local authority. Funding for taxi ranks is a matter for local authorities.</P>
        <P>Section 11 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 provides that the Commission for Taxi Regulation may provide financial assistance to local authorities to support the development or provision of infrastructure to facilitate and support the operation of small public service vehicles.  The provision of any such financial assistance is a matter for decision by the Commission for Taxi Regulation.</P>

	<P>The EU US Open Skies deal was discussed at the Transport Council on 12 October 2006.  The Council underlined the importance it attaches to the conclusion of the EU US air transport agreement.  It reaffirmed its unanimous satisfaction with the text of the draft agreement negotiated in November, 2005 but regretted the further delay in the US  rule-making procedure relating to the ownership and control issue.  The November, 2005 text includes the transitional measures relating to Ireland that I had agreed with my counter<Col N="2040"/>part in the U.S. relating in particular to a phased change in the arrangements relating to Shannon.</P>
        <P>The Council requested the Commission to continue its efforts, on the basis of further contacts with the United States to secure a satisfactory and balanced outcome with the necessary safeguards, including the transitional provisions, with a view to a decision at the December Transport Council.  This would fulfil the commitments set out in the conclusion of the June 2006 EU US Summit in which both parties reaffirmed the commitment to reach agreement by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I again drew attention to the negative consequences of failure to finalise the agreement for those Member States that do not have open skies agreements in place already.  I emphasized therefore the urgency of concluding this matter in December.  In the meantime the existing arrangements in the Ireland US bilateral agreement will continue to apply.</P>

I intend to meet the RSA Board in the coming weeks to discuss these matters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 sets a primary target of a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998-2003 period.  This was always an ambitious target and one that required the continued commitment to a strategic, integrated approach by all of the road safety agencies. </P>
        <P>A major independent review of the previous strategy confirms that basing the primary target on the achievement of progress in the areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing remains the correct approach and these remain the key areas central to the implementation of the Strategy.</P>
        <P>Significant initiatives identified in the Strategy that have been realised to date include the introduction of a new system of metric speed limits, the further extension of the operation of the penalty points and fixed charge systems from April 2006, and, the establishment of the Garda Traffic Corps.  The Corps, provides the basis for the achievement of the significant gains in road safety that emanate from consistent high levels of traffic law enforcement.  Other major proposals iden<Col N="2043"/>tified, such as the plans to establish a system of private sector operation of speed cameras under the auspices of the Garda&iacute;, are well advanced.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Act 2006 has been enacted and a number of key measures commenced.  These include the provision to combat drink driving through enabling roadside Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) and a ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving.</P>
        <P>Since the commencement of MAT checkpoints by the Garda&iacute; the number of road deaths and collisions have fallen.  The number of deaths in August 2006 was 17, the lowest number for any month since November 1999 comparing to 24 in August 2005 and 35 in 2004.  This downward trend has continued into September 2006 with 22 deaths as compared to 31 for September 2005, and on into October 2006 with 31 deaths compared to 44 deaths in 2005.</P>
        <P>We are making progress across the wide range of initiatives identified in the current Strategy, which is now coming to an end, and I am satisfied that all of the agencies involved are fully committed to the achievement of the goals that underpin the Strategy.  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is working on developing a new road safety strategy for the period beyond 2007 and went out to public consultation on this last month.  Proposals can be e-mailed to <i>strategy@rsa.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The RSA recently submitted to me, a range of proposals, to further augment road safety initiatives with a particular focus on licensing reform, and, on targeting drivers between 17 and 24 years old.  I equally share the concern of the RSA Board about the high risk factors of death and serious injury to this particular category of drivers and I will be considering these proposals in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>I also recently met with the Chief Executive Officer of the RSA and asked that the Authority come back to me as soon as possible with a structured approach to a complete transition, with time lines, from the current regime of provisional licences to a regime of learner permits and restricted category drivers and related learner/driver formation arrangements.  I know that such a complete transition will take some time, but I genuinely feel that there is great <Col N="2044"/>potential for saving young lives in this approach.  I intend to meet the RSA Board in the coming weeks to discuss these and related matters.</P>

	<P>The Sheep Industry Development Strategy Group issued its report in June 2006. This is a comprehensive study of the sheep industry which sets out a Development Plan for the industry contained in 37 recommendations.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The production of Biofuels is one of the main elements in developing the renewable energy sector in Ireland. In the recently published Green Paper &ldquo;Towards A Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland&rdquo; the Government made a firm commitment that the development of an indigenous biofuels industry is a core component of Government policy to improve energy sustainability. My Department has been working with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to develop biofuel policies and I am participating in a Ministerial Taskforce on Bioenergy to oversee preparation of a National Bioenergy Action Plan by end 2006. The Plan will establish a firm road map and set challenging targets to develop biofuels and biomass resources up to 2020. </P>
        <P>On the demand side, I am confident that the recently announced Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme valued at &euro;205m will help drive additional demand for the production of energy crops. When fully operational in 2008, it will deliver some 163 million litres of biofuels per year and should result in Ireland achieving 2% market penetration of biofuels.</P>
        <P>On the supply side, support to farmers for growing energy crops may only be provided in accordance with EU Regulations. Under the Energy Crops Scheme, aid of &euro;45 per hectare is available for energy crops provided they are intended primarily for use in the production of biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. In addition to this scheme, set aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses including the growing of crops for energy purpose and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme. The EU has agreed that sugar beet <Col N="2051"/>will be eligible for aid under the scheme and may also be grown as an energy crop on set aside land. At the February Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting, I called for a review of the energy crop premium as it was not proving effective in Ireland and I subsequently raised the matter with the Agriculture Commissioner.  The EU Commission has published a Report on implementation of the scheme and has made a Proposal, which would allow member states pay national aid up to 50% of the costs associated with establishing multi-annual crops. The Proposal is currently being discussed in Brussels.</P>

        <P>My Department will continue to support the development of emerging biofuel technologies through the Department&rsquo;s Research Stimulus Fund Programme. Last year, we began providing direct funding worth &euro;4.5 million, on a competitive basis, to support priority research projects in the bioenergy sector. Five of the projects selected under the 2005 and 2006 calls for proposals directly relate to biofuels and energy crops and received total grant assistance of some &euro;1.5m. Projects supported under this Programme will complement the research work being done by Teagasc and others in this area.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe that the development of an indigenous biofuel sector presents a new opportunity for farmers and rural communities. Biofuel development will help stimulate diversification of farm incomes, generate sustainable employment and contribute to the development of rural economies. I will continue to work closely with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that agriculture contributes to the development of biofuels as part of a coherent energy policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The responsibility for implementation of the Health (Country of Origin of Beef) Regulations 2006 (SI 307 of 2006) lies with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  There are over 44,000 food businesses in Ireland of which 29,000 are in the service sector. This includes restaurants, hotels and pubs.  These food businesses are inspected on a routine basis by some 220 Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) in the Health Service Executive (HSE) operating under a service contract with the FSAI.</P><Col N="2052"/>
        <P>Inspections primarily focus on compliance with hygiene and food safety requirements.  Checks on compliance with the Health (Country of Origin of Beef) Regulations are now incorporated into routine inspections for establishments covered by these Regulations.  To date no prosecutions have been taken for breaches of the Regulations.</P>
        <P>The FSAI is preparing written guidance for all caterers on how to comply with the Regulations. In the meantime, consumers are advised of their right to have the country of origin of beef provided to them by a caterer. Where such information is not made available they should bring this to the attention of the HSE in the first instance, or the FSAI.</P>
        <P>The enabling legislation passed by the Oireachtas in March of this year, under which these regulations were made, also facilitates the extension of country of origin labelling to all meats. However, because different origin labelling requirements apply to other meats in the retail sector, under current EU legislation, and there are also different systems of traceability as well as some import/export complexities, it is not as straightforward as it is for beef. The European Commission has opposed Member States introducing legislation in this area that is in excess of common EU requirements.  Nonetheless, my Department is at present in the process of drafting new regulations to require operators in the retail and catering sectors to provide country of origin information on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat.  It is my intention to submit these regulations, when they are finalised, to the European Commission for approval as required by EU legislation. I am also taking every opportunity to press the European Commission, both bilaterally and in the Council of Ministers, to take measures to introduce compulsory country of origin labelling on all meats at EU level. I have used opportunities presented by bilateral meetings with other Member States to seek their support for extended country of origin labelling rules.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payments Scheme National Reserve under categories A and D. </P>
        <P>Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000-2002.  The person named was not deemed successful under this category as the land was not acquired free of charge or for a nominal amount.</P>
        <P>Category D caters for farmers who inherited or purchased land and who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  The person named was not successful as the land acquired was leased land which did not qualify for this category.</P>
        <P>A formal letter outlining my Department&rsquo;s decision issued to the person named and the person named submitted an appeal against this decision and provided additional documentation in support of his appeal. In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision. In this case the documentation was examined by my Department but did not provide grounds for a change to the original decision. This case has since been forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who will carry out a full review of the case and will correspond directly with the person named following the outcome of their review.</P>
        <P>Under the 2006 National Reserve there are provisions for New Entrants to farming who have leased land.  This category (Category B) caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who, while farming during 2002, did not receive any direct payments in respect of that year.  The income and educational qualification that applied in 2005 will again apply to this category.  In addition, new entrants who <Col N="2055"/>are farming leased / rented land will be eligible for an allocation provided they can demonstrate a genuine commitment to farming.  In this context the leased/rented land must have been declared on the 2004 Area Aid application and on the 2005 and 2006 Single Payment Scheme application.</P>
        <P>My Department has forwarded a 2006 National Reserve application form to the person named for his attention. Should the person named feel that he qualifies for the 2006 National Reserve he should return the completed application form to my Department offices in Portlaoise at his earliest possible convenience.</P>

	<P>A revised Farm Waste Management Scheme was introduced by my Department in March 2006 in order to assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the Nitrates Directive.   As the Scheme forms part of the current EU Rural Development Round, it must close for new applications at the end of this year.  However, I am aware that some farmers are experiencing delays in preparing planning applications, particularly in regard to the preparation of drawings.  I have, therefore, recently announced that my Department is prepared to receive applications up to 31 December 2006 when accompanied by written confirmation by the agricultural planner that it is intended to lodge a planning application on the farmer&rsquo;s behalf.  The planner will be required to lodge with the Department by 31 March 2007 both written confirmation that such a planning application has been lodged and also a copy of the set of drawings which accompanied the planning application. Before final consideration of the application can take place, full and final planning permission, including conditions, must be received. All applications which do not require planning permission must be lodged by 31 December 2006.  I am satisfied that this additional flexibility should provide every interested farmer with an opportunity to submit an application before year-end under this most attractive grant Scheme.    </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 432 and 434 together.</P>
        <P>The authorisation, marketing and use of plant protection products is controlled by the Department of Agriculture and Food by way of Statutory Instrument No. 83 of 2003.  Residues of pesticides in food of plant origin, including mushrooms, are controlled by Statutory Instrument No. 179 of 1999.  There is an annual pesticide residue monitoring programme agreed between the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Food Safety Authority (FSAI) which determines the number of samples of different food items to be analysed for pesticide residues.  Since 2000, some 183 samples of mushrooms have been analysed for pesticide residues under the official monitoring programme.  The <Col N="2060"/>results from 2000 to 2005 have been published and no maximum residue level (MRL) exceedance was detected during this time.</P>
        <P>If there is a suspicion or an allegation of the illegal use of a plant protection product, then the Department of Agriculture and Food by way of its Pesticide Control Service carries out inspections to investigate the matter.  Where illegal use occurs controls are applied as stipulated in Statutory Instrument No. 83 of 2003.  The penalties in place for the illegal use of plant protection products are, on conviction, a fine of up to &euro;5000  and/or six months imprisonment.</P>
        <P>On foot of allegations made to my Department, an inspector from my Department visited one of its premises on 24/10/06.  At the time of inspection no evidence of the illegal use of a plant protection product was detected.  Also on the 24th of October a further premises of the company was visited.  At the time of the visit there was no visible sign of activity at the premises so an inspection was not carried out.  The inspections on the 24th of October were unannounced.</P>
        <P>This company also participated in the Bord Bia Quality Assurance scheme up until 2005.  The aim of this scheme is to set standards in relation to all aspects of production, handling, packing, storage and transport of produce.  All participants undergo a minimum of one full inspection annually conducted by an independent National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) inspector against the Bord Bia standard for horticulture producers.  This is a voluntary scheme.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that our pesticide controls which are governed by EU and national legislation are sufficiently robust to provide the consumer with the highest standards of food safety and to ensure that workers along the food chain are protected.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The criteria for eligibility for the NDP grant aid are set out in the Terms and Conditions which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  All projects are approved subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  When a claim for payment is made a detailed inspection of the project is carried out by an inspector from the Department.  All documentation is checked including invoices, bank statements and tax clearance certificates before payment is made.</P>

	<P>The disposal of waste materials generally is covered by the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2005, which apply to all sectors of society including the agricultural sector, and is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, manufacturers and importers of farm plastics, that is, silage bale wrap and sheeting, are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market, or alternatively to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes to recover the waste in question.  The Irish Farm Film Producers Group (IFFPG) is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.  Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste.  The Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and my Department has no involvement in the running of the IFFPG scheme.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the IFFPG scheme has lacked sufficient resources to satisfy the demand that existed for collections of farm plastics.  Therefore, following discussions with the IFFPG, farming <Col N="2062"/>organisations and local authorities, last May, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, announced amendments to the scheme to support improved services to farmers.  Under the new arrangements, the scheme is being funded by a combination of the existing levies paid by the producer members of IFFPG who run the scheme and funding from weight based collection charges to be paid by farmers availing of the service.  I have been informed that the effect of the new arrangements will be to ensure that the farm plastics collection service provided by the IFFPG to farmers can match the demand on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>I understand from my colleague, Minister Roche, that, to address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  This service, which operated on a pilot basis in some counties during the summer, is free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government through the Environment Fund.  The scheme is being rolled out to other counties on a staggered basis and I have been informed that announcements regarding further extensions of collections to other areas will follow completion of the collections in those counties taking part in the recently announced second phase of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Participants in REPS are required to avail of a recycling collection facility (such as the IFFPG scheme) where one exists, and to store such waste plastics neatly and safely on the farm pending disposal.  This advice is applicable to all farmers, whether they are in REPS or not.  Officials of my Department who carry out on-farm inspections have been made aware that some farmers, for reasons outside their control, do not currently have access to the IFFPG scheme.</P>

	<P>The EU Directive providing for exemptions from the mandatory veterinary prescription requirement was adopted by the Standing Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use on 10 October last.  The Directive concerned does not specify a list of products to be exempted, but rather contains a set of criteria on the basis of which Member States, if they choose to do so, may exempt products from the prescription requirement.  As the Irish Medicines Board is designated under national legislation as the competent authority, it will be a matter for that body to apply the criteria in individual cases.  As I have already informed the House, I am satisfied that the criteria, as adopted, will not require &lsquo;off prescription&rsquo; veterinary medicines to be reclassified.</P>
        <P>The Directive concerned requires each Member State which decides to avail of the exemptions provision to notify the EU Commission by 31 March 2007.  My Department will send the appropriate notification to the Commission before this deadline.  While it is ultimately a matter for the IMB, it is not envisaged that existing &lsquo;off-prescription&rsquo; products will have to go through a formal approval process arising from the criteria.  In terms of reformulated products, it is understood from IMB that such products, in the normal course, must go through the appropriate approval process specified by the Board.  In any event, as part of its statutory functions, IMB is required to keep the risk benefit profile of all products under ongoing review in light, for example, of advances in scientific knowledge, data supplied by sponsoring companies and safety information supplied by users.</P>

        <P>However, I am aware that some farmers are experiencing delays in preparing planning applications, particularly in regard to the preparation of drawings.  I have, therefore, recently announced that my Department is prepared to receive applications up to 31 December 2006 when accompanied by written confirmation by the agricultural planner that it is intended to lodge a planning application on the farmer&rsquo;s behalf.  The planner will be required to lodge with the Department by 31 March 2007 both written confirmation that such a planning application has been lodged and also a copy of the set of drawings which accompanied the planning application.  Before final consideration of the application can take place, full and final planning permission, including conditions, must be received.  All applications which do not require planning permission must be lodged by 31 December 2006.  I am satisfied that this additional flexibility should provide every interested farmer with an opportunity to submit an application before year-end under this most attractive grant Scheme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At primary level there are now more than 5,000 teachers working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. </P>
        <P>At second level, approximately 1,854 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs.  This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils.  In addition, there are 534 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,365 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.</P>
        <P>The general allocation model at primary level is based on the premise that all primary schools have children with learning support or high incidence special educational needs.  Early intervention support at primary ensures that many children do not need additional support at second level.</P><Col N="2067"/>
        <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved.  Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support.  In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios.  Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P>Second level pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support from the remedial/learning support teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.  All second level schools in the free education/block grant schemes have an entitlement to an ex-quota teacher allocation in respect of remedial/learning support teaching and guidance provision.  There are currently a total of 534 wholetime equivalent remedial/learning support teachers and 684 wholetime equivalent guidance teachers in place at second level.</P>
        <P>My Department also allocates additional teacher support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and Vocational Education Committees to cater for pupils with special educational needs, including, where appropriate, pupils with dyslexia.  To qualify for additional teaching support, under this category, children must be assessed by a psychologist as being of average intelligence or higher and having a degree of learning disability specific to basic skills in reading, writing or mathematics which places them at or below the 2nd percentile on suitable, standardised, norm referenced tests.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education Act, 2005. With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and/or special needs assistant support for the pupil.  In accordance with the terms of circular letter M10/94, pupils with dyslexia may also, depending on an educational assessment, meet the criteria for exemption from the learning of the Irish Language on the grounds of having a learning disability.  Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the Certificate Examinations.</P>

	<P>My Department facilitates apprenticeship training through the provision of places in Institutes of Technology. Where additional capacity is sought by F&Aacute;S the Institutes of Technology are invited to make proposals for individual trades.</P>
        <P>My Department has received a joint proposal from GMIT and the college referred to by the Deputy to run two blocks of Phase 4 each or Phase 6 each per term in the trade of plastering over three to five years. This proposal seeks funding from my Department for GMIT which would supplement funding sought from the Minister for Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in respect of the college referred to by the Deputy. I understand that the Minister for Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs intends to consider this proposal in the wider context of issues relating to the future of agricultural colleges. It would therefore not be appropriate for my Department to make a decision on this proposal until the wider issues involved have been considered.</P>

	<P>As you are aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the 75 local special educational needs organisers, known as SENOs, is responsible for processing applications from schools for special needs supports. These supports include resource teaching hours and SNA support for pupils with low-incidence special needs and assistive technology or equipment for pupils in either high-or low-incidence special educational needs categories. In this way pressing needs in the area of special needs supports in schools are identified early and acted upon quickly.</P>
        <P>My officials have been in contact with the NCSE regarding an application for assistive technology for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. I can confirm that an application has been received by the local SENO. The SENO requested additional information from the school in support of the application and this was furnished to the SENO recently.  The SENO will convey a decision on the application directly to the school authorities as quickly as possible.</P>

        <Quest> the percentage of GNP <i>per capita</i> invested in each second level student in each of the past ten years. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The data requested by the Deputy are contained in the following table. They show, over a ten year period, the ratio of spending per student at second level (DES gross voted current expenditure) to Gross National Income per capita. It should be noted that the increases in spending as a proportion of GNI per capita in recent years have of course been set against a backdrop of a significant increases in Ireland&rsquo;s Gross National Income, thereby the extra provision for education has been very substantial.</P>
        <P>Spending by my Department on second level education has increased significantly in recent years. Indeed it increased by 17% between 2003 and 2005 alone. In 2005, &euro;2.7 billion was spent on second-level education &mdash; up from &euro;2.3 billion in 2003 and &euro;1.25 billion in 1997.</P>
        <P>These increases have allowed for major progress to be made both in the staffing and in the day-to-day funding of our schools. In relation to funding, the standard capitation rate has increased from &euro;266 per pupil in 2003 to &euro;298 per pupil from 1 January last. In addition, the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from &euro;127 per pupil in 2003 to &euro;159 per pupil from January last. This per capita grant is in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some &euro;15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have also been made in the staffing of our second level schools in recent years. With the creation of over 2,000 additional posts and the retention of over 2,100 posts which would otherwise have been lost due to the fall in enrolments, there is now one teacher for every 13 students at second level.</P>
        <P>This increase in staffing has dramatically improved the support available to children with special needs at second level. Indeed, there are now over 1,800 teachers working specifically with students with special needs in our second level schools &mdash; up from only about 200 such teachers in 1998. In addition, there are more than 500 learning support teachers and more than 1,300 special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.</P>
        <P>The number of language support teachers at second level catering for pupils for whom English is a second language has also grown significantly from just over 100 teachers in the 2001/2002 school year to nearly 350 such teachers in the current school year.</P>
        <P>Guidance provision has also been improved, with an additional 100 guidance posts allocated in the 2005/06 school year. The additional posts included provision for a further improvement in the allocation of Guidance hours for post-primary schools participating in the DEIS programme. There are currently a total of 683 whole-time <Col N="2073"/>equivalent posts allocated for guidance in post-primary schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">So, as I have outlined, major improvements have been made in both the funding and the staffing of our second level schools in recent years. I assure the Deputy that I will continue to prioritise further progress in both these areas. While this Government has consistently prioritised increased investment in education, it should be noted that levels of investment are not the only thing that affect the quality of the education provided. In that context, I am sure the Deputy will be pleased to know that in increasing investment in recent years we have also put a major focus on measures to improve educational outcomes. I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to ensure that the resources targeted towards education are being used to best advantage at all levels.</P>
        <P>In the past, investment in public services was severely restrained by resources and public indebtedness. Today, with the highly successful economic policies pursued by this Government, Ireland is a relatively more prosperous nation and we have greater scope to make further improvements to public infrastructure and provision. It is my firm intention to continue to provide for additional resources for education at all levels.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of delays in the payment of grants for the reasons referred to by the Deputy. The organisation and management of student support scheme grants is a matter for individual Vocational Educational Committees. Each Vocational Educational Committee receives a block staffing complement from my Department which affords VECs considerable flexibility to meet the various needs of the committee and its schools including the operation of the student support grant scheme. It is a matter for each Vocational Educational Committee to decide how to deploy its staff. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of my determination to ensure that students get decisions on their grant applications and get paid within a short period of time. To this end the new Student Support Bill will provide for a service level agreement that will include specific deadlines to be met in processing applications and in making payments. While this new system will not come into effect until next year, I am anxious that students should not be waiting unreasonable amounts of time in the current academic year. If the Deputy wants to make me aware of precisely which VEC(s) he is referring to, I will ask my officials to contact them.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service, established in 1999, allows for all primary and post primary schools to have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. The number of psychologists in the NEPS has increased from 43 to 127 at present.</P>
        <P>Where a pupil on the Autism Spectrum is placed within a mainstream class, the school may prioritise that child for referral to a psychologist from NEPS. All children allocated places in Units for children on the Autism Spectrum were most likely assessed by HSE prior to entry to these units. Support for children with Autism is a complex matter and inter disciplinary collaboration is a fundamental principle. Traditionally, health services, including psychological services, have been provided by HSE on a continuing basis.</P>

	<P>On the 1 February 2006 the Minister for Health and Children and I published the report of the Fottrell Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training. Among the recommendations of the Fottrell Group was that a graduate stream of entry to medicine be introduced and that all graduates of honours Bachelor degree programmes should be eligible to apply. </P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the Higher Education Authority will shortly issue a competitive call for proposals to provide the new graduate entry programme, with a view to additional places being provided on this programme from 2007.</P>
        <P>It has been decided that graduate entry will be open to graduates of all disciplines. The provision of a graduate entry stream is an important development in reducing pressures on aspiring medical students who until now have effectively had one chance of entry, based on their Leaving Certificate performance. This will allow students to make a decision to enter medicine at a more mature age and should result in a more diverse range of entrants into the profession.</P>
        <P>No decisions have been made on the level of tuition fees for the graduate programme as this will form part of the overall outcome of the call for proposals.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, while some capital funding has traditionally been given to minority ethos fee-paying schools such as the Presbyterian school referred to, the amount of capital funding given to fee-paying schools has been extremely small in recent years.  For example, in the period 1999-2004, the total amount of capital funding given to fee-paying schools represented just 1.6% of total second level capital expenditure.</P>
        <P>Considerations of State support for minority religions has been an important factor in the provision of funding for such schools, given that much of the fee-paying sector has traditionally been made up of Protestant schools and those with a minority religious ethos.</P>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement. </P>

        <P>A specific function of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is to identify appropriate educational placements for all children with special educational needs.  The family concerned has been advised to contact the relevant SENO in this regard as eligibility for tuition under the terms of the scheme will be determined by availability of placement in the new location.</P>

There is a Gaelscoil in operation in one of the blocks and my Department has entered into a security arrangement with a security firm for the safeguarding of the remaining two vacant blocks until such time as they are put into educational use.

The HEG Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities on behalf of my Department, the other three maintenance grant schemes are administered on a similar basis by the VECs.</P>
        <P>The PLC Scheme prescribes the terms and conditions of funding in respect of students attending courses in approved PLC Centres. The other three schemes govern the award of grants to students attending approved courses in approved third level institutions. Grant applicants must be assessed by the awarding bodies with reference to the terms and conditions prescribed in the Scheme relevant to the course being pursued and the college being attended.</P>
        <P>Generally speaking students are eligible to be considered for grant assistance in respect of only one PLC Course. Clause 3.2 of the PLC Scheme sets out the circumstances under which grant assistance may be awarded in respect of subsequent study at PLC Level &mdash; i.e where a candidate already holds a qualification no higher than FETAC Level 5 and are now pursuing a course that offers progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid.</P>
        <P>While the course in question is listed as an approved PLC course, grant applicants pursuing the course are subject to the terms and conditions of funding prescribed in the PLC scheme.</P>
        <P>I have no plans at present to alter the terms of the PLC Scheme in order to allow students who already hold a third level qualification including a BTEC Higher National Diploma course to continue to receive PLC grant assistance.</P>

	<P>Under Article 42 of the Constitution the State has a duty to provide for free primary education and to ensure that each child receives at least a certain minimum level of education.  The State discharges the latter obligation through the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).</P>
        <P>Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, the NEWB has a function to advise and assist children and parents of children who are experiencing difficulties in attending school.  The Board is required to assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in ensuring that their children attend school regularly, and will also assist schools in fulfilling their role under the Act. Through the appointment of Educational Welfare Officers, the Board provides a welfare-focused service which is accessible to parents, school and others concerned with the welfare of young people.</P>
        <P>My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, against a refusal to enrol and where that appeal is upheld.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses to enrol a student in the school. An appeal will generally not be admitted unless it is made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the Board of Management was notified to the parent or student concerned. However, in the case of an appeal being lodged against a school that comes under the aegis of a Vocational Educational Committee, it is necessary that the initial appeal application is lodged with the VEC Committee in the first instance.</P>
        <P>If the appeal is unsuccessful, or no appeal is brought, the NEWB must make all reasonable efforts to have the child enrolled in another school.  If those efforts fail the Board, with the parents&rsquo; and Department&rsquo;s consent, must make other appropriate arrangements to ensure that the child receives the minimum education to which he or she is constitutionally entitled.</P>
        <P>The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. </P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP.  These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</P>
        <P>Applications for review were received from the schools referred to by the Deputy and were thoroughly examined by the Review Group.  In accordance with the recommendations of the Review Group, the schools have not been identified for inclusion in the School Support Programme and the Principals were informed by letter on 4th August, 2006.</P>
        <P>Schools which have not qualified for the new School Support Programme and which are receiving additional resources, both human and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing disadvantage, will retain these supports for 2006/2007.  After that, schools will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
        <P>The DEIS action plan states that, as well as the provision being made under the new School Support Programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools <Col N="2092"/>where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the Department&rsquo;s maintenance grants schemes, and in accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s 2005 Third Level Student Maintenance Grant Schemes the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the prescribed conditions with regard to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  A mature student is defined for the purposes of the schemes as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians.  An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; or guardians&rsquo; income or address.</P>
        <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the means test provision of the scheme specifies that the students&rsquo; means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit.  This <Col N="2095"/>provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</P>
        <P>Generally speaking, candidates continue to be assessed under the terms and conditions of the Scheme appropriate to their year of entry.  Accordingly, candidates who where not classified as Independent Mature Students at the time of entry, or re-entry, to an approved course may not generally be assessed as such for the duration of their course.</P>
        <P>When the candidate in question commenced her Taught Graduate Diploma in Advanced Materials in 2004/05 academic year she was re-entering the third level education system under the 2004 grant scheme.  As the candidate did not have a break in study between that course and the Research Masters, commenced in 2005/06 academic year, she continues to be assessed under the conditions of the 2004 Scheme.  As the candidate did not qualify to be assessed as an Independent Mature Student under the 2004 Scheme her status will not change for the 2005/06 academic year.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality Of Opportunity In Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. </P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP.  These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded themselves as having a level <Col N="2096"/>of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</P>
        <P>Primary schools seeking a review were advised that applications must relate to data on the relevant variables included in the ERC survey of May, 2005 and to the reference date of 30 September, 2004.  They were also informed that consideration would be given to major changes in a school&rsquo;s socioeconomic composition at the mid-way point between the 2005/2006 and 2009/2010 identification process i.e. in 2007/2008.</P>
        <P>An application for review was received from the school referred to by the Deputy and was thoroughly examined by the Review Group. In accordance with the recommendations of the Review Group, the school has not been identified for inclusion in the School Support Programme and the Principal was informed by letter on 4th August 2006.</P>
        <P>Schools which have not qualified for the new School Support Programme and which are receiving additional resources, both human and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing disadvantage, will retain these supports for the 2006/2007 school year.  After that, such schools will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently received correspondence from the school outlining changes in the socioeconomic profile of the area and has been informed that the points made will be noted in the context of the mid-term review of schools which have had a major change in socioeconomic composition since September 2004.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government, in July, 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements.  The barracks in question were located at Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Clancy Barracks, Dublin, Ballincollig, and Kildare.  The sale of Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas and Clancy Barracks Dublin have been completed, together with most of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.  The disposal of the remaining lands at Ballincollig is being progressed at present.</P>
        <P>Subsequent to its closure, the Government decided on 1 July 2003, that Magee Barracks, Kildare, would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative.  Until recently, approximately 15 acres at the former military barracks were being used by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to accommodate asylum seekers and site security was arranged by that Agency.  The Agency has vacated the site which has recently been handed back to my Department.  Costs incurred by my Department in the provision of private security at the former barracks since its vacation by the Agency amounted to &euro;9,922 up to 30 September, 2006.  A further site at this location, comprising approximately one acre, is being used by Kildare County Council as a temporary halting site.  Security at this site is arranged by Kildare County Council.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s property portfolio consists of almost 100 sites including 27 permanently occupied military barracks, together with lands comprising circa 21,000 acres.  For reasons of security it is not proposed to name and identify the location of every vacant or unoccupied building under my Department&rsquo;s ownership or to indicate any security arrangements pertaining.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 517 to 519, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In September 2004 the Government confirmed the Office of Public Works (OPW) as the State&rsquo;s lead agency in flooding, to be tasked with delivering an integrated, multifaceted programme aimed at mitigating future flood risk and impact.  My Department has not received requests from local authorities for funding in respect of remedial works as a result of bad weather in the week ending 29 October 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department provides assistance to local authorities to supplement their own resources in respect of a number of local authority functions. For example, the Local Government Fund, which is estimated at &euro;1.4 billion this year, is ring-fenced exclusively for local government and used mainly to fund general-purpose and non-national road grants. General Purpose grants may be used by local authorities to meet their ongoing and special expenditure requirements, including flood relief.</P>
        <P>The improvement and maintenance of non-national roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State Grants. My Department&rsquo;s Memorandum on Grants for Non-National Roads indicates that the cost of remedial works on non-national roads, necessitated by flooding, storm damage and other severe weather conditions, must be met from local authorities&rsquo; own resources and discretionary grants provided by my Department. Local authorities have been advised that they should set aside contingency sums from these resources to finance such works. In 2006, the discretionary grant allocation to county councils is almost &euro;53 million and the block grant <Col N="2104"/>allocation to City, Borough and Town Councils is &euro;15.51 million.</P>
        <P>Funding is also available under the Water Services Investment Programme in respect of works that form part of a waste water scheme and are necessary to prevent surcharging of foul sewers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 521 and 522 together.</P>
        <P>The tabular statement gives details of the combined capital allocation for disabled persons and essential repairs grants notified to each local authority in 2005 and the combined out-turn expenditure on the schemes by each local authority.  In 2005, the capital allocation for these schemes was &euro;74.5m and out-turn expenditure <Col N="2105"/>notified to the Department by local authorities was &euro;64.6m.</P>
        <P>The combined capital allocation to local authorities for the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes represents not a capital grant, but the total amount which authorities are authorised to spend on the schemes in the year in which the allocation is made.  Expenditure on the grant schemes is funded by the two-thirds recoupment available from my Department together with the one-third contribution from the revenue resources of the local authority.  The allocations were made on the basis of local authorities&rsquo; best estimate of the likely level of grant approvals during 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The out-turn reflects the expenditure by local authorities on approved applications.  However, some grant approvals by local authorities may not subsequently be taken up by applicants. In addition, if there are delays in applicants completing the approved works, either due to a delay in getting contractors or for other reasons, the ultimate spend may arise in later years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the light of the high level of demand for these grants, my Department requests each local authority to examine the level of payments and approvals on both schemes throughout the year with a view to establishing the adequacy or otherwise of their allocations.  Requests for increases from authorities whose allocations are proving inadequate are dealt with in the context of the surplus funding available from authorities whose allocation may emerge to be surplus to their requirements.</P>
        <P>The administration of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme is delegated to local authorities within the framework laid down in statutory regulations; as far as is practicable, this is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility at local level.  In light of the increased demand for grant assistance, the majority of local authorities have reviewed their schemes over recent years in order to streamline their operation and have introduced a variety of mechanisms to ensure the available resources are targeted to those in most need, including medical prioritisation, means-testing and/or cost control.  My Department does not have detailed information on the number of local authorities which currently have means-testing in place.</P>
        <P>The review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme, which incorporates the conditions governing the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme, was recently finalised within my Department.  The issue of means-testing and the requirement that local authorities make a contribution from their own resources towards the financing of the scheme have been considered in the context of the overall review.  My Department is currently preparing proposals for the future operation of the schemes, in conjunction with other public <Col N="2106"/>agencies concerned, and I expect to be in a position to announce these shortly.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> the reason his Department refused an application for funding to replace a section of water mains in Toberona, Dundalk, County Louth; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this section of gravity flow water mains has been leaking for at least six months and that traffic is driving across this exposed pipe, adding to the loss of treated water. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of a national campaign to improve operational efficiency and to reduce leakage from public water supply systems, capital funding of &euro;4 million for water conservation measures has been allocated to Louth County Council under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2005-07.</P>
        <P>Under the national water conservation programme, local authorities are first required to establish water management systems, including data collection, district metering and telemetry facilities, followed by active leakage control measures to identify and repair leaks.  The objective of this investigative phase is to identify the overall condition of distribution networks and to allow local authorities to formulate strategic and prioritised proposals for infrastructural rehabilitation and renewal with the aid of funding from my Department.</P>
        <P>I understand that comprehensive rehabilitation and renewal proposals will be submitted to my Department for approval by Louth County Council in the new year following completion of the investigative phase of the Council&rsquo;s water conservation programme.  The Council&rsquo;s previous application for funding in relation to the Toberona water mains was not approved, pending completion of the overall assessment of priorities and in light of the Council&rsquo;s responsibility for day to day management of public water supply infra<Col N="2108"/>structure.  Any proposals relating to Toberona that may be included in the submission expected from the Council in the new year will be dealt with as quickly as possible by my Department.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> the number of local authorities that have a privatised refuse collection service; and the number of these that have a locally administered refuse waiver scheme. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>According to information supplied to my Department by local authorities in July this year, private operators provide the waste collection service in 17 local authority areas, a combination of private operators and local authorities provide the service in 15 local authority areas and local authorities provide the service in 2 areas. A waiver scheme is in place in 3 of the 17 privately operated areas, in each of the 15 areas where a combined service operates and in both areas where the local authority provides the service.</P>
