    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the continuing crisis in Letterkenny General Hospital that has led to chaotic conditions throughout the hospital with patients on trolleys being a daily feature, the daily cancellations of outpatient clinics and elective surgery leading to the endangering of the well-being of both patients and staff and the urgent need for immediate action to alleviate the crisis by the sanctioning of the required 70 beds for the hospital to meet the medical needs of more than 130,000 people living in County Donegal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for Transport to explain to the House his unwillingness to meet Cork city and county Members of the Oireachtas on the future of Cork Airport, especially since his avoidance is being accompanied by threats to the airport in maintaining its current level of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the reason the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the refugee immigration agency treat asylum seekers and the citizens of Kiltimagh so badly, with inadequate provisions for young asylum-seeking males who deserve proper facilities and the people of Kiltimagh who have been badly let down by the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the rapidly deteriorating situation at Cork Airport where Ryanair has withdrawn some of its services because of increased charges arising from the fact that the Government has not delivered on the written promise given by the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, that Cork Airport Authority would not incur a debt because of the construction of a new terminal at Cork Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the failure of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to ensure proper contracts and decent pay for people working in the home help service who provide vital care for elderly people, allowing them to live with dignity in their homes and helping to reduce the pressure on hospitals and nursing homes; the need for the T&aacute;naiste to immediately reverse the reduction in home help hours and to ensure that her Department meets its legal obligations to home help workers and to all those who require their service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: to hear the case for a patient charter and additional resources for Beaumont Hospital to end the appalling overcrowding which last Monday resulted in a lady with a serious case of pneumonia being left on a hard plastic chair from 12.30 p.m. to 10.30 am., ten hours later, before being told the hospital had no space, even though she needed hospital care, and to have the Minister for Health and Children address this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the record number of people now on trolleys, giving rise to what the IMO calls our worst ever accident and emergency crisis, due in part to the winter vomiting bug, and the need now for the T&aacute;naiste to make a statement to this House about the setting up of a new unit in the HSE to deal with the accident and emergency crisis, how she intends to implement the ten-point plan and if she will finally recognise that the real problem here is the lack of capacity in terms of acute beds and beds in the community.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 11, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for <Col N="775"/>a Council decision on the accession of the European Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law &mdash; back from committee; No.27<i>a</i>, Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 1, National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 11 shall be decided without debate; that Report and Final Stages of No. 27<i>a</i> shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m by one question, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in respect of amendments, include only those amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs; and that on rising today, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall adjourn until<?oasys _jy ?>2.30 p.m on Tuesday, 21 March 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not agreed. On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, I object to the adoption of this motion without debate. Ireland is already a member of the Hague Conference and, as such, has one autonomous vote in the course of all the conference&rsquo;s proceedings. My colleagues and I are concerned that under this motion, the European Community may usurp this independence on the part of all member states and seek to apply a single European Community vote, thereby undermining the autonomy of the member states of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, expressed concerns about this proposal when it was considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. He asked a number of pertinent questions about it, none of which was answered by the Minister. As a result of this, there are key questions which have yet to be addressed but which must be teased out. This can only happen in this House, where the questions will receive full and appropriate scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Our concern is that this is the second motion relating to the Hague Convention in recent weeks. The Government is adopting a piecemeal approach to adoption issues instead of bringing forward large-scale legislative reform in an area that has been left unchanged for several years. There is an onus on the Government to explain to the House why it is not tabling amendments to the adoption Acts which many people anticipate and only moving as little as possible in obligations under this international treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is proposing that the motion be taken without debate, so I <Col N="776"/>cannot agree with the Deputy. There was a full debate in committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will put the question re the proposal for dealing with No. 11 without debate.</P>
      <P>Question: &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 11 without debate be agreed to&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with item No. 27<i>a.</i> to conclude Report and Final Stages of the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill 2006, agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed. I already made the point on more than one occasion that we should not be in the business of guillotining legislation. Rushed law is bad law. There are a whole range of issues to be debated under the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill. I am not happy that the Bill will be guillotined by vote at 1.30 p.m. It appears in recent weeks that, on the one hand, the Government wants to remain here until 11 p.m. to make some semblance of progress before there is a mass exodus next week to places all over the world to represent the country and on the other, it wants to bulldoze through this legislation. I object to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government Whip appeared to have introduced a new regime of not guillotining legislation, which we welcomed. However, he recently appears to be reverting to type and guillotines are now a regular feature.</P>
      <P>This Bill did not comply with the normal accepted regulations concerning the introduction of Bills. It was published just one day before going through Second Stage, which is not acceptable. Committee Stage just finished on Tuesday and the spokespersons are being asked to deal with 42 amendments in two hours. This amounts to approximately a minute and a half per amendment, which is not adequate. As it is an important Bill which affects the quality of life of a large number of people, we are asking that it be debated fully until the amendments are dealt with in the normal way. We do not accept the guillotine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Deputies, the Green Party opposes the guillotining of this Bill, particularly as it is fundamental legislation, with 42 amendments. The amendments were tabled in a considered fashion in the hope that time would be allowed for a debate. By guillotining it and hoping to have the matter dealt with without any fuss, essentially, the Government is making a mockery of Report Stage and the idea of improving the legislation. It results in the Opposition going into a default mode. Only one or two amendments will be dealt with, which does not make the best use of parliamentary time. The <Col N="777"/>Government should ask for Opposition co-operation without a guillotine, which would encourage Members to get through the business and be more productive. This would make better use of parliamentary time. The Government should remove the guillotine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on what can only be described as the debacle of the passage of the Finance Bill through the House earlier in the week, with the guillotine at 11 p.m. and the curtailment of examination and debate, one would have hoped that the appeals of Opposition voices to the Government would have been heard and heeded by those on the Government benches. However, there is repetition once again on a crucial area of legislation, which will have a huge impact on the daily lives of ordinary people. It is very important that the Bill gets the scrutiny it <Col N="778"/>deserves and that it gets the full debate and voice the legislation demands. Therefore, I oppose the imposition of a guillotine which allows very limited opportunity to debate the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is precisely to improve the daily lives of people that we want to see this legislation being passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste think we do not want to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly there are timeframes for both the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill. As many of the issues were debated widely during the budget debate, it is unfortunate that the Government must proceed by way of a guillotine to get the legislation through the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I do not agree to the proposal that the D&aacute;il adjourn today until Tuesday, 21 March 2006. As I said yesterday, Donna Cleary was murdered in the suburbs of Dublin city. Anarchy rules in parts of the city and its suburbs. Clearly, there is a need for strong, deterring legislation in respect of the gun culture properly identified by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Emergency legislation was introduced in this House on immigration, ground rents and payments in respect of long-stay patients in public hospital beds. Some 20 to 25 sections of the Criminal Justice Bill deal with gun culture. I object to this on the basis the D&aacute;il should meet on next Tuesday and Wednesday. Those Members who will be away all over the world will be very far removed from the anarchy on the streets of this city when they are representing their country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on and clarify a matter. It is deplorable that more than 500 people were on trolleys and chairs yesterday due to overcrowding in hospitals. When the T&aacute;naiste became Minister for Health and Children she made a commitment to deal with overcrowding within months and published a ten-point plan, which is now in tatters. Is it not the case that in October 2004, when 180 people were on trolleys, the establishment of a similar task force, including a plan to deal with accident and emergency departments over an 18-month period, was proposed to the interim Health Service Executive? If the proposal had been accepted, we would be 18 months further on than the task force the T&aacute;naiste now proposes to establish.</P>
      <P>In respect of No. 56 on the legislative programme, what definite objectives and targets will the Government achieve in the foreseeable future to deal with the scandalous and appalling situation of 500 people being left on trolleys and chairs in hospitals throughout the country? It is scandalous that nurses, patients and doctors face the kinds of pressures reported in today&rsquo;s newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, I ask the T&aacute;naiste if she recognises these words:</P>
      <P LI="1">People will judge our health services by accident and emergency services... I expect real and measurable improvements to take place in the coming months in the delivery of accident and emergency services... Accident and emergency departments form a litmus test for me, the Government and the people...</P>
      <P FLI="0">They were spoken by the T&aacute;naiste on 26 January 2005 when the problem, bad as it was, had not reached anything like the level to which it has <Col N="786"/>since sunk. The T&aacute;naiste will have seen figures in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers which show we have reached the worst position ever. Overcrowding is no longer concentrated in a small number of hospitals but scattered throughout the country&rsquo;s hospitals, with just short of 500 people on trolleys. Patients are being fed at the entrance to toilets and accommodated in a fashion which is not acceptable in a civilised society.</P>
      <P>The picture is worse now than when the T&aacute;naiste launched her ten-point plan in November 2004. It is a crisis and while I am not predisposed to doing so, I would be minded to ask for her resignation were she not the pick of the clapped out group of burnt out Ministers who accompany her on the Government side. This matter must be addressed. Setting up another task force and using more verbiage and rhetoric when people are being accommodated without dignity in uncivilised circumstances and staff are unable to provide the kind of care they would like to give is unacceptable. This is the lowest point we have reached in nine terrible years of the Government&rsquo;s management of the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Almost 500 people are lying on trolleys in appalling conditions in what is, according to the Government, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. On taking office as Minister for Health and Children, the T&aacute;naiste told us she would deal with the crisis in accident and emergency services and, as the previous speaker noted, stated this would be the litmus test of her tenure in office. She established the Health Service Executive to deal with the accident and emergency crisis but it has worsened. She also stated she wanted to deliver a world-class health system. The position in hospitals throughout the country shows that the health system, far from being world-class, is worse than that of a Third World country. It is appalling.</P><Col N="787"/>
      <P>When will the T&aacute;naiste recognise that the problem is one of capacity? The experts have told us that more acute and community care beds are needed but the T&aacute;naiste has not delivered on her promises in this regard. It is time she delivered although I do not believe she will be able to do so before the next general election. The electorate will have to judge her on her handling of the accident and emergency crisis, an issue on which she has lost the plot and is out of her depth. I hope that instead of establishing another task force she will inform the House of her proposals to deliver extra beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is presiding over an escalating crisis in our hospitals. The Irish Nurses Organisation has called on the Cabinet sub-committee on health to meet to address this crisis. Has the T&aacute;naiste arranged for such a meeting to take place? It is the least that should happen. With a Cabinet sub-committee in place, we do not need further task forces or what can only amount to a token effort and charade but real action to address the current crisis. In November 2004, when launching her ten-point plan, the T&aacute;naiste stated: &ldquo;Our ten accident and emergency actions will help patients and their families well beyond the accident and emergency departments&rdquo;. The reality of the past week was that people were unable even to access some accident and emergency departments. It was not only an issue of beds but of people who could not even get trolleys. It is absurd in this Ireland of plenty people are suffering within the health system.</P>
      <P>Now is the time to concretely address this issue. Additional capacity of in excess of 2,500 beds is needed to resolve the problem but nobody should say that is not achievable. In my community, a situation arose recently in which 26 beds were removed and photographs in my local newspaper revealed they were dumped at the side of the hospital building. That is incredible but it is the reality. It is time for the T&aacute;naiste to take back the reins of responsibility because she cannot continue to wash her hands of blame like Macbeth. She is the Minister and the people expect her to take responsibility and to act accordingly.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, who is sitting behind the T&aacute;naiste, is aware of the issue because we met with hospital staff last week and jointly promised to raise to raise the issue here.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is totally out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a man has been waiting for a bed in Mayo General Hospital since last Thursday. His consultant in Castlebar thinks he should be in hospital in Galway for a consultant haematology bed. The consultant haematologist in Galway, Dr. Dwyer, wants to accept him but no beds have been available since Thursday. This man is 77 years of age and is now dying of advanced anemia. Even if a bed is provided for him today, he will not be able to take advantage of it because hospital staff believe he has become unfit for travel. These are real problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and real people. I am sorry for speaking on this matter but parliamentary questions should be asked throughout the summer so that we can deal with these ongoing problems because shortages of beds do not simply go away during D&aacute;il recesses. Yesterday, there were 17 beds in UCHG and 12 in the urgent hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I promise to be brief. I do not want to be specific, although 49 people remain on trolleys in Cork. Does the T&aacute;naiste believe the crisis has reached such a stage that it is now imperative for her to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to deal with it? I accept we should travel abroad on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day but, given that desperately ill people are being cared for on trolleys and chairs, the last thing the T&aacute;naiste should do this week is leave the country. Does she seriously intend to depart the country despite the crises in the health service? Will she deal with this appalling situation now rather than leave it to Professor Drumm, who clearly does not accept the argument that capacity is at the heart of the matter?</P>

	<P>On the same issue, the hospital in Naas has 24 patients on trolleys, which represents the lowest number there for a considerable time. <Col N="790"/>The hospital is in a state of chaos, even though two wards are idle and await the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s sanction to tender for work on them. The plans are in place and I appeal to her to intervene directly in this matter.</P>
      <P>Right across the board, the privatisation of cleaning services in hospitals has resulted in dirty hospitals. That also needs to be addressed.</P>

	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste tell us whether the people who are waiting to be put on waiting lists will form part of the statistics being compiled by <Col N="791"/>the Health Services Executive? When will we see the official waiting lists which seem to have been buried behind a wall of secrecy? There should be three categories, the first two comprising those waiting for surgery and outpatient appointments. The third list, which is as long as my arm, should consist of people awaiting outpatient appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste properly explain why people in Counties Longford and Westmeath had to wait nine and a half years for 103 additional beds in Mullingar General Hospital? Is not the root cause of the problem the failure to provide beds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why people are in corridors and on trolleys. It is a disgrace. Members of the Government arrive for photograph opportunities, then disappear like snuff at a wake. Staff, including nurses, attendants and ambulance drivers, are left to carry the can for this Government. It is time for it to stop engaging in its hypocritical cant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I was asked by Deputy Kenny about legislation to establish the Health Information and Quality Authority.

It is hoped we will have the full Bill by the summer recess.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Accident and emergency is a priority. Proportionately speaking, we have the same number of beds as the UK, even though our population of over 65s is 11% as against 17%.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am more than happy to take responsibility and ensure that problems are addressed. We have trebled the number of accident and emergency consultants, employed 7,500 more nurses in hospitals, opened 1,100 additional beds in four years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Open the wards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and have 2,200 more dental and other medical staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The population has increased, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation is changing. At present, more than 100 beds are closed in our acute system because of the vomiting bug. That represents a considerable loss of capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste will not open them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>More than 100 beds across the country are closed. If we want to hear from an expert, let us listen to Dr. Lane, an accident and emergency consultant in Letterkenny hospital, who agreed there are pressures but believes there is light at the end of the tunnel and that change is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Give Letterkenny their 70 beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>However, change will only take place when we deal with issues in each hospital. Tallaght Hospital, which I know well as does Deputy Rabbitte, had a 1.9% increase for the accident and emergency department, and some weeks ago it had a 300% increase in the numbers of people on trolleys. When representatives from the National Hospitals Office went into that hospital and worked with people there, they were able to make dramatic improvements.</P>
      <P>Discharge policies vary significantly from hospital to hospital. Unless we use the capacity provided by the taxpayer as effectively as possible, no amount of new beds will ever solve the problem.</P>

I ask that the Minister, with the Taoiseach, would make the case on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day for Irish people who are illegally in America. Australia was treated as a special case, and that country received 10,500 visas last year. We want 30,000 or 40,000 for our Irish illegals.</P>

	<P>In the forthcoming week, there will be women from the likes of Somalia and Nigeria seeking permission to make lives here for themselves and their children.

	<P>With regard to the legal ombudsman, we will have the legislation this session, and the heads of the Bill were approved by <?oasys _ch ?>Government some time ago. With regard to <?oasys _ch ?>undocumented Irish at the rally in Washington DC yesterday, I understand Niall O&rsquo;Dowd acknowledged the work of the Irish Government in this regard. The Taoiseach and all the Ministers going to America will continue to lobby as forcefully as possible on the matter.</P>

	<P>He speaks of being the meat in the sandwich, but the meat is cut from a very hard neck. I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste about the product from some of this meat.</P>
      <P>Looking at the programme for Government produced in 2002 by the Progressive Democrats, we were to have major reform of criminal law laying down uniform guidelines and principles with regard to punishment of offenders. We were to have a law that would radically overhaul fines, and a nationwide indictable crimes court which would reduce the delay between charging and trial. We were to have new legislative provisions to deal adequately with crimes committed by juveniles, including provisions to update sentencing, rehabilitation and training. We were to have powers for the DPP to appeal against lenient sentences in the District Court. These are just a few of the commitments made in the PD manifesto and reflected in the programme for Government <Col N="795"/>which I noted while sitting here listening to the debate about which we have seen nothing in this House in four years.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has come in and abused other Members but he will not deliver on the issues he has committed to. Instead he goes to his office and issues a press statement. There is an issue of accountability. Today, somebody being investigated with regard to a very serious crime in my constituency has walked away from the investigation because of a technicality. This is not acceptable. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot lecture all those around him, speak of a watershed in the approach to crime, and yet produce a dismal record on relevant commitments made four years ago to tackle some of these issues.</P>

      <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on continued anomalies affecting persons who were recipients of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">My colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan, has been very insistent about this amendment. He indicated that only a small number of people are affected and eloquently articulated the exact anomaly to the Minister on Committee Stage last Tuesday. The amendment proposes that the Minister deal with anomalies whereby people could find themselves in a worse situation as a result of some of the recent changes he has made. The number of people affected is declining and I ask the Minister to keep the matter under review, as he indicated he would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for taking the trouble to table these amendments. I appreciate them and will keep these matters under review. I take note of what Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan and Deputy Penrose said.</P>
      <P>Following the introduction of the one-parent family payment in 1997 the deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit was discontinued with effect from 2 January 1997. The scheme for deserted wives under social insurance has been retained in that entitlements already acquired in August 1992, when the earnings limit was introduced for new claimants, and in 1997 when the one-parent family scheme was introduced have been preserved.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, the budget for 2006 increased the upper earnings limit for the one-parent family payment to &euro;19,500 per year, an increase of &euro;83 per week. As I said on Committee Stage, recipients of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit with dependent children may transfer to the one-parent family payment if it is beneficial for them to do so. There are only approximately 100 deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit recipients on reduced rates due to earnings, of which 48 would be eligible to transfer to the one-parent family pay<Col N="800"/>ment. I take the point that it is a small number and we will keep the matter under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that. The number is declining and we do not want people to be disadvantaged. The amendment was designed to ensure things are updated on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the effect and operation of means tests overall in the social welfare system and in particular in relation to the carer&rsquo;s allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We cannot propose an amendment that would have a monetary impact and this is one way of ensuring that the issue is addressed. Carers are an extremely important issue for the Labour Party and one on which we have articulated a particular vision. The amendment concerns the means test. Too many schemes operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs are subject to means testing. It is a complex and bureaucratic system. From a socio-economic viewpoint we do not want a regressive measure but the means test has been burdensome, cumbersome and bureaucratic and has been an impediment to the recognition of carers. There are between 148,000 and 150,000 carers and just under 25,000 now get carer&rsquo;s allowance but not all of them receive the full amount.</P>
      <P>It would be churlish of me not to recognise what the Minister has done for carers and, on behalf of the Labour Party, I acknowledge that. He has made substantial progress in the area. Now, just a further &euro;145 million or &euro;150 million are needed to abolish the means test. I know the Minister is not ideologically opposed to that but wants to ensure the money does not go to multi-millionaires. Unfortunately many carers and those for whom they care are far from multi-millionaires. Those in that category should not even think about asking the State to provide for them. If I were in that category, I would not do so but would hope my own children would look after me if they had the wherewithal.</P>
      <P>Many of the 150,000 carers provide care on a 24-hour basis, seven days per week and 52 weeks per year. I acknowledge the situation has been ameliorated by the Minister&rsquo;s introduction of respite care provisions, such as raising the limit to &euro;1,200, and his widening of its scope so more than 30,000 will now receive the allowance. I would be less than honest and engaging in political pettiness of the worst order, which the House should avoid where possible, were I not to acknowledge what the Minister is trying to do.</P><Col N="801"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party to which the universality principle is fundamental, I urge the Minister to recognise the need for a carer&rsquo;s strategy in which that principle could be encompassed or embedded. All units of the Labour Party feel strongly in this respect. A local councillor telephoned me last night and told me to tackle the issue. Every family in the State is affected by the carers issue and I am deeply committed to it. In its report on carers, the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, including its Government members, displayed deep commitment to this fundamental issue. I will not say when Government programmes will be negotiated but this matter will be on the cl&aacute;r and will not be removed. The State is saving billions of euro as a result of the unselfish and compassionate work of these people.</P>
      <P>The carer often grows more ill than the person being cared for, or enters poorer circumstances because looking after the unfortunate person being cared for is strenuous work. This amendment would facilitate keeping people in their own homes, environments and localities, where they were born and bred, grew up, worked and are happiest. Members of the House were involved in a report of the National Economic and Social Forum under the chairmanship of Dr. Maureen Gaffney that indicated this is an important issue. The NESF also examined an area in Holland where the cost of the provision of services in the &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; system, including chiropody and other services for the elderly, has dropped by up to 30% <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> putting people into institutional care. The clear outcome of the examination is that it is cheaper and more cost effective in the long term to keep people within their home environments.</P>
      <P>At first glance the Minister may be surprised and say the amendment is the antithesis of what the Labour Party stands for. However, the universality principle is important to the Labour Party. Most carers are ordinary, working class people in receipt of other benefits. We spent much time speaking about accident and emergency units, beds and so on. This measure would free up many beds within hospitals, caring institutions and elsewhere and would be an effective mechanism. A measure to devote another &euro;150 million to the carer&rsquo;s allowance would save the State between &euro;600 million and &euro;800 million. For this reason, the allowance is cost effective. A carer&rsquo;s strategy, which is important in this context, and a needs and assessment Bill have been called for. I would support that Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>If it is good enough in Northern Ireland which has legislation underpinning the needs and assessment of carers and those being cared for, with statutory examination of circumstances, and at a time when the buzz words include North-South institutions and equality of treatment North and South, why can we not have such provision here? <Col N="802"/>We should ensure this central issue is taken account of in relation to the carer&rsquo;s strategy. Therefore, I urge the Minister to examine this matter. I know he cannot do so today but perhaps he can over the next number of months. We should reach a consensus on the matter if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s commitment to this issue. In his contributions as the Chairman of the committee in question, he singled out carers as his top priority. As such and due to his patent commitment, I owe it to him to take the issue seriously.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, we have made substantial progress. The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been eased significantly in recent years, particularly with the introduction of disregards for spouses&rsquo; earnings. In budget 2006 we provided for an increase in the income disregard on the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test to &euro;290 per week for a single person and &euro;580 per week for a couple from April, which will ensure that a couple with two children will be able to earn up to &euro;32,925 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance. The same couple will be able to earn up to &euro;54,400 and receive the minimum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the free travel and household benefits and the respite care grant.</P>
      <P>We discussed the possibility of abolishing the means test and I have listened to the points made. I have an open mind in terms of the allocation of funds and will keep the matter under review. If I want to invest an amount of money in the carer&rsquo;s allowance, the issue is one of whether it is the best use of that resource. The Deputy is correct that I will not be ideological in this regard. If a measure makes sense, I will examine it. Due to their costs, means tests are sometimes not worth having.</P>
      <P>The respite care grant scheme was extended in June 2005 to all persons providing full-time care and attention regardless of their means. It is a universal payment to which those persons who do not receive a carer&rsquo;s income support payment from the Department are entitled subject to meeting the full-time carer condition. The respite care grant was increased to &euro;1,200 from June. The number of claimants on the scheme is 24,981 at an estimated expenditure of &euro;223 million. The number of respite care grants is 34,300 at an expenditure of &euro;34.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a related point on this important issue regarding the carer&rsquo;s allowance and the need to make a report on a particular matter, namely, older people who look after spouses, parents, sons or daughters and are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance. However, when they reach pension age, they are told they can have one or the other but not both. In effect, they are told that their work as carers is no longer valued. They are entitled to pensions by virtue <Col N="803"/>of their ages but, before reaching that age, were entitled to carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
      <P>This is unfair and wrong. I do not know how much it would cost the State to rectify but do not believe it would be much. It is a great injustice. We are speaking about people of advanced years who are doing extra work. The carer often becomes the person cared for due to the burden placed on him or her. Can the Minister justify this situation and what are his thoughts on the matter? Having got to know the Minister better in recent times, he is one of the more caring Ministers in the Government. However, it is a glaring injustice that people of advanced years cannot get the carer&rsquo;s allowance. The respite grant helps but everyone involved in caring gets it, which I welcome. Will the Minister address this issue and inform the House of how much it would cost to allow people to retain all or part of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, as was once suggested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a few points in support of the amendment. Carers are not invisible even though some think of their work as done in the background. We all know family members or neighbours who are carers. Although they are a part of the community the amount of work they do is underestimated because it takes place in people&rsquo;s homes and is so great it makes it difficult for them to be active in the community. Carers are invaluable.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the abolition of the means test for carers. Previous speakers referred to the situation in the North and although positive changes have been made in this State, we should continue to examine the North as a model for changes to which we aspire. According to UN reports this country is, <i>per capita</i>, the second richest in the world. The inequality in this State affects many carers who provide an essential service. The State continues to expect people to undertake this work and Deputy Penrose has referred to possible savings of &euro;800 million.</P>
      <P>I know of young people who are carers and their lives and careers are on hold. These people seek recognition of the work they do and the changes that have taken place over recent years are insufficient. We should eliminate the means test for carers and calculate how much this would cost, taking into consideration how much the State saves in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand the point the Deputies are making. I examined the half rate allowance before the budget, as recommended by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, but I was unable to implement this measure. Instead, I increased the carer's allowance to &euro;200. The State non-contributory pension is now &euro;182 and the carer&rsquo;s allowance for those over 66 years is &euro;200.</P>
      <P>The reason I could not implement this measure is because it would extend to other categories and <Col N="804"/>I was unable to confine it to State contributory or non-contributory pensions. The half rate would also have to be offered to many other categories and this would lead to a substantial bill. This would also break the fundamental rule of the welfare system, which allows one to move to a higher payment. This is easy to administer and works well throughout the system. We examined the proposition for the half rate allowance because, in theory, the idea suggested works well. If one wishes to continue caring beyond 66, one can receive the higher carer&rsquo;s allowance. We must try to implement additional measures in this area and we will continue to monitor the situation even though the one payment principle makes it difficult to change.</P>
      <P>I met the Caring for Carers organisation yesterday. This group, based in County Clare, impressed upon me the need for a strategic approach. I look forward to meeting this group and other organisations to see how we can make progress. At present my Department considers carers as a group needing income support. Some argue the payment should change to a more formal structure of compensation, such as a wage or salary. This is a major change which we have not made at this point but which will be kept under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I urged the Minister to meet the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs so that consensus can be reached and progress can be made. Following his commitment to do so, I withdraw amendment No. 2.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on a statutory indexation of disregards.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister replied to Deputies Stanton and Se&aacute;n Ryan on this issue on Committee Stage, stating that the increases have been far in excess of the consumer price index. However, this amendment refers to disregards rather than mainstream benefits. I refer to the inflexibility of the system and the low threshold of secondary benefits. The threshold for the retention of secondary benefits, such as rent supplement and back to school clothing and footwear, has remained unchanged since 1994 at &euro;317.43, equivalent to &pound;250. This was never linked to inflation, which would have increased by &euro;123 to &euro;430. This can result in a real loss of income if wages on offer are above this threshold. The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor made changes to the conditions for eligi<Col N="805"/>bility for rent supplement and this exacerbated the situation. Under the amended rules, a couple was ineligible for rent supplement and various training programmes if one person worked full-time, or 30 hours, regardless of wages.</P>
      <P>A report was written by Conor Ryan of the Blanchardstown Area Partnership. It considered the barriers to those in receipt of rent supplement, living in private rented accommodation and intending to find employment. I highly recommend this document and commend its author. It examines the nature and prevalence of barriers to employment in areas with national employment action plan clients. It provides case study detail on F&Aacute;S and the national employment action plan clients, providing a brief outline of entitlement conditions that apply to rent allowance or medical cards. Many of us do not have time to investigate these cases although we meet such people at our clinics. Disregards are an issue, especially in respect of the inflexibility that arises when they are not updated regularly.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not wish mainstream payments to be included on the statutory indexation but could include the disregards. Indexing the disregards would ensure that poverty traps would not emerge as the unintended consequences of a positive change made by the Minister. When the Minister is criticised by Deputy Crowe, Deputy Stanton or me he must wonder why we are complaining if he has granted an increase of &euro;30, which is well in excess of inflation. When the Minister has taken two steps forward, the unintentional consequences of his action move us one step back. It happens because the disregard that enabled those people to retain a secondary benefit is not concurrently moved.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s reply is that he cannot increase it by 15% or 20% with inflation at 3% and I agree with him. I suggest tying the payment to the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton made a good point. Many people on contributory and non-contributory pensions receive the fuel allowance. The &euro;9 a week is a lot better than what it was but it is still not enough. I remind the Minister that the last three week period was one of the coldest spells of the winter. The Minister may say this is the winter and when we were young, all of December, January and February was cold. People are used to the climatic change which has resulted in a balmy January.</P>
      <P>I am worried that the number of contributory pensioners in receipt of the fuel allowance from the Department has dropped every year since 2003. Electricity prices have sky-rocketed by more than 40% in the past four years and the price of gas was increased by 25% in October. There are now 707 fewer contributory pensioners eligible for fuel allowance than three years ago. In 2001, 23% of contributory pensioners received the fuel allowance and this has dropped to fewer than 19%, at a time when people regard the Government as being awash with money and the <Col N="806"/>Exchequer is bloated. They ask me to bring this to the attention of the Minister. This scheme should be reviewed in terms of the statutory initiation of the disregards. A contributory pensioner with an ancillary pension from a local authority, the ESB or CIE, for example, of more than &euro;51 per week, will lose the fuel allowance. The demographics indicate the number of people aged over 66 is rising so the numbers receiving the fuel allowance should be increasing but are decreasing. The reason for the decrease is that the threshold of &euro;51 has not been changed. A county councillor from County Kilkenny contacted me yesterday on this point. He asked if I had done anything on this issue. I was glad to be able to tell him I was on top of this issue because often that is not so. The threshold of &euro;51 has not changed in five years.</P>
      <P>The number of pensioners is unknown but 707 fewer contributory pensioners are now eligible for the fuel allowance than three years ago. They may be losing the fuel allowance because the &euro;51 threshold has remained stagnant with no indexation over the past five years. A pensioner in receipt of a pension of &euro;51.50 does not qualify for the fuel allowance and loses out on the payments. The fuel allowance is worth &euro;9 a week. In some cases, the more a person earns, the less they receive.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to ignore the essential point made by Deputy Stanton that those people have made their contributions over many years &mdash; otherwise they would not be in receipt of a contributory pension. If they had not worked in contributory employment, they would not be in receipt of a pension from the ESB or Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. The pensions from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are very poor. It must have been the worst pension scheme ever and every Deputy in the House will agree. My father worked for the local authority but his pension was certainly better than the pension received by people who had responsible positions such as driving trains in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann. This is a significant point for many people who worked in that organisation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to address the issue of the fuel allowance and the threshold of &euro;51. I acknowledge the fair point he has made that if indexation was applied to everything, many people would lose out. I ask him to confine it to the ancillary allowances and benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Deputy Penrose, has made many points on my behalf and these were raised on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I refer to the case of a gentleman in receipt of a small occupational pension. His wife is currently in receipt of the non-contributory State pension. His occupational pension means he exceeds the income limit for the fuel allowance. It also reduces his wife&rsquo;s non-contributory pension by &euro;25 per week. He regards this as a double assessment which is unfair.</P><Col N="807"/>
      <P>On the issue of disregards, I welcome the increase in the capital disregards but this does not impact on the occupational pension. If the man dies, his occupational pension dies with him and his wife will no longer receive it. However, an anomaly exists. If a pensioner couple have, for example, capital of &euro;56,000, and one person dies, the spouse will still be allowed access that capital. The anomaly is that of capital versus income and the small occupational pension can be a significant disadvantage as opposed to having capital.</P>
      <P>Under the earnings disregard this gentleman&rsquo;s wife would be allowed earn &euro;100 per week before her pension would be affected but she is very ill with cancer and cannot work. If the man was in receipt of a non-contributory State pension, his wife&rsquo;s earnings would not be used to reduce his pension. His occupational pension is used to reduce his wife&rsquo;s pension. These anomalies need to be examined. I ask the Minister to consider these points and come back to the House with proposals to deal with these issues which seem to be unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that anomalies exist throughout the system and we are trying our best to iron them out, within an overall philosophy of supporting people. On the issue of indexation, the consumer price index rose by 34% in the past ten years, gross earnings rose by 65% and social welfare rates increased by 84%. I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s point about disregards is slightly different. Nevertheless, social welfare rates have increased almost three times the rate of inflation and are substantially ahead of gross earnings. Had an indexation clause been in place for the past ten years, it would have cost social welfare recipients dearly and I know that is not what is intended here.</P>
      <P>I also acknowledge that the disregard for lone parent&rsquo;s allowance has not changed since 1997 and we have now made a substantial change. It is important to retain the flexibility of being able to move disregards around. It is sometimes good policy not to increase them because it may be preferable to be able to move people in a different direction. The flexibility to move disregards and thresholds around to bring about a better social policy is probably good because it allows us to move people on to better places, as I have often explained to the House.</P>
      <P>The increase in the capital disregard was from &euro;12,000 to &euro;20,000. Deputies will be aware of the new disregard of earnings of &euro;100 and the &euro;20 up from &euro;7.60. The income disregard for the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been increased from &euro;290 for a single person and &euro;580 for a couple. This means a couple with two children can earn &euro;32,925. The lone parent&rsquo;s allowance thresholds have increased from &euro;293 to &euro;375 with a tapering relief included. The increase in the spouse&rsquo;s income disregard for entitlement to QAA has increased from &euro;88 to &euro;100. There has been sub<Col N="808"/>stantial increases in family income supplement. It would not be wise to put indexation into legislation and I do not believe the Deputy is asking for that. Successive Governments in their budgets have done their best to assist vulnerable people and I hope that will continue. I take the point that thresholds and disregards must be reviewed regularly to ensure adequacy, determine whether they keep up with inflation and earnings, and examine how they contribute to moving social policy in a particular direction. I will examine the case mentioned by Deputy Stanton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not want to pursue it I want to ensure that the failure to examine disregards for a considerable time, more than ten years on occasions, does not happen again. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s commitment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the clawback policy by the State from the estates of the deceased of non-contributory pensions where the assets were accrued exclusively or partly from savings for pensions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This old chestnut has been discussed for the past two years. Mr. Moran from Waterville in Cork has been in constant contact with us on the State&rsquo;s clawback policy from estates of deceased non-contributory pensioners when the assets were accrued wholly or partially from pensioners saving their pensions. To receive a non-contributory old age pension one is means-tested thoroughly. It is a detailed scrutiny of pension entitlement. Pensioners may build up a store of money by living frugally and saving the pension to which they are entitled. If such an accumulation exceeds a certain threshold, which the Minister increased substantially in the last budget, the money is the subject of a reassessment. This has occurred in a limited number of cases from the mid-1990s until the Minister increased the threshold in the past year approximately. Although the scope is limited, this is an important issue that has caused great distress and trauma for people who have been left behind. Some cases against the Department on how it handled the matter were won, with the appeals officer determining matters in favour of the applicants although the Minister said they were won on narrow issues.</P>
      <P>We must examine this issue using the equitable principle of tracing money to its source. If a person wins money and it contributes to a significant body of assets, that is identifiable. This is an increase in means and if the person fails to dis<Col N="809"/>close it, I do not hold any brief for that. The Minister pointed out in a recent meeting of the Committee on Social and Family Affairs that the money involved in this issue is significant, approximately &euro;5 million per year, more than &euro;30 million in total. Many figures were mentioned during that meeting and the Minister broke them down to make them suitable for us to absorb, which I tried to do. The Minister probably thinks I will call for that to be distributed elsewhere, and I cannot argue with that. However if one has already been assessed, saves money from one&rsquo;s pension and then dies, that money becomes the subject of a reassessment. The State reassesses money it has already assessed. Once money is identifiable and labelled surely it can be taken out. If there is &euro;100,000, &euro;30,000 of which arose from pensions savings over 20 years, that &euro;30,000 should be exempt from the clawback. The remaining &euro;70,000 which is unidentified or arose because of a windfall, for example from gambling winnings or accident compensation, which was not notified to the Department could be subject to the clawback.</P>
      <P>Mr. Moran made the point that the Department is sometimes at fault because it does not tell people this situation might arise. To forewarn people is to forearm them. There has been a bad information campaign to alert people. The Department did not entertain the argument as a specific case. Some of the money that might be pertinent to this has been subject to a Supreme Court decision that it must be handed back and this may aggravate the situation. That is another complex layer. The HSE may have kept the money and now it will come back. How does that fit into this scheme? It will be an interesting and complex situation. The Department said funeral expenses and other miscellaneous outlays would be allowed. It did not appear that this happened in the case Mr. Moran pursued on behalf of his elderly friend. The independent appeals system decided in favour of Mr. Moran, vindicating the independence of the social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Mr. Moran has focused in minute detail on the core issues and brought to our attention the lack of transparency in the rules, proportionality and fairness. He feels that was how the appeals officer was convinced to rule in his favour. Under the consolidation of the Social Welfare Act new facts and logical arguments should be taken into account. In many lone parent cases the appeals officers take situations into account in the round and I am glad to see appeals are successful. I recently called for an amnesty and in the context where people can appeal this is a useful mechanism. The Department has been remiss in dealing with this issue and I urge that it be examined in a compassionate and sympathetic context. That is the least we can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>We have debated this many times and it is complicated. It is important that people realise that if they accumulate money over a cer<Col N="810"/>tain amount they will be liable to have a reduced non-contributory State pension. The clawback kicks in after they die. We should examine the possibility that if a person proved that he or she had no source of income other than the non-contributory payment the clawback would not apply, but if he or she had another source of income it would apply. If a person was very frugal &mdash; it would be difficult, but possible, to accumulate that sort of money &mdash; I would feel sorry for him or her because his or her lifestyle would suffer. We must examine the reason people do this. People are often afraid of getting old. They are afraid of the high costs they might have to incur in their old age if they have to go into nursing homes and so on. They are very worried about that. That is why older people very often scrimp and save all the money they can, so they will have something to fall back on if the day comes. I know the Minister is concerned about the social aspects of social welfare and this is an issue as well. Older people really worry about what will happen to them when they are on their own. Perhaps the family is not in a position to help and they do not want to be a burden, and so on. They save money and are in the position where they have cash. It is no good to them really if they die and the money is in the bank. The Department starts clawing it back and there is nothing wrong with that as it is the law. However, if a person&rsquo;s only source of income is the non-contributory pension, a mechanism should be found so the clawback does not arise.</P>
      <P>An issue then is who benefits if there is no clawback. People&rsquo;s savings, of course, will benefit their relations. Where there is a will there is a relation, as my learned friend, Deputy Penrose, probably knows. Often there is more than one relation. They seem to appear out of the woodwork. That issue must be considered as well. It is complicated, but first we must ensure we look after our old people better and remove many of the fears they have. Then, in the cases of non-contributory pensions as the sole sources of income, the Minister might examine how the clawback might not be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the last six years the Department has reviewed 9,474 such cases. I am referring to the assets of deceaseds&rsquo; estates and the number of means-tested pension cases for which the Department has assessed overpayments. The number found to have overpayments was 2,326. As I said on Committee Stage, that recovered &euro;30.9 million. It works out at around &euro;5 million a year, on average, with about 350 to 400 people affected per annum. An interesting point arises, which only came to my attention recently. In determining whether a deceased person was overpaid, funeral, legal expenses and capital, that is, savings and investment to the value of &euro;10,000, are disregarded in the first instance. In addition, the standard capital allowances, as previously outlined, are applied. <Col N="811"/>This means there is a special disregard of &euro;10,000 for estates. I had not realised that. This should help and perhaps, in the future, that might be a way of tackling matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton made the point about taking a different view as regards clawbacks, in cases where the only income is a non-contributory pension. Proof is difficult to establish in such cases and it could open up further issues for us, which I will not outline again. Enormous increases in disregards for the elderly have been introduced in recent years, particularly in the recent budget, for example the &euro;20 change and the fact that a pensioned couple can have &euro;70,000 and still get a maximum rate. That makes it less likely that they will have these overpayments. Increasingly we are trying to ensure social welfare means-testing arrangements do not act as a disincentive to claimants who want to become savers. We do not want to penalise regular savers in any way. At the same time we must ensure the system is fair. Obviously this will be kept under review. Keeping an eye on the &euro;10,000 might be an angle that we could pursue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has made a good point. I wonder whether the &euro;10,000 has to do with the inheritance tax structure as opposed to where an agreed figure might be disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to get more advice on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good concept. Even if it is not in our area, perhaps we could look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good concept and the Minister is correct. In that context I have no hesitation in withdrawing the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 6 is in the name of Deputies Penrose and Se&aacute;n Ryan and it arises out of Committee Stage proceedings. Amendment No. 7 is related, and both amendments may be discussed together. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the social insurance treatment of self-employed people in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance who are looking after ill spouses.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="812"/>
      <P FLI="0">I am pleased the two amendments are being taken together. It saves me having to repeat myself, which I do not want to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave an illuminating reply to this on Committee Stage. I was using an example I know of, which related to Kerry. I will use one relating to Waterford in a few minutes to illustrate how important is the credit system. In the Kerry case the wife of a self-employed man had motor neurone disease. As with many couples, the man stopped working and looked after his wife. He was not self-employed on a large scale, but it kept the couple ticking over. He got the carer&rsquo;s allowance and was very happy about that. He was concerned that having dropped his self-employment he was no longer able to accumulate credits and there would be a big gap in his contribution record. I was seeking a carer&rsquo;s credit from the Minister for the man who is carrying out this work 24 hours a day, seven days a week to obviate all those issues, as outlined by Deputies Stanton and Crowe in the House this morning. The Minister told me the payment of &euro;253 per annum was similar to the child care supplement, another issue that he was dealing with, and that this could be paid. I believe that is what the Minister said and I hope I am not misinterpreting him.</P>
      <P>Like all Deputies and spokesmen, my colleagues bring other cases to the Minister. Obviously the job of spokespersons in Opposition is to deal with their particular areas. I have another case for the Minister to review for which I want a reply. If he does not have an answer I would like if he could get one, as this is important for the person involved. A young accountant in her early 30s at the top of her profession is self-employed. The Minister will know more about this than I do, since he is an accountant by profession. He will appreciate that someone in her early 30s is hoping to get to the top of the tree, and accountants progress. Unfortunately, she was struck down with illness. She was paying her S1s, but now, very regrettably, she will not be able to return to that profession again. However, she wants to make a social welfare contribution. As an accountant she naturally recognises, as does her family, the importance of contributions.</P>
      <P>I am a typical Paddy as well. I might have worked for years without making contributions. Nothing would worry me until the day of the storm, when I was looking for the scolb. One has to be prepared for the storm. The storm in this case is when a person gets old and the pension evaluation day arrives. The Department looks at the record and sees so many S1 and normal contributions were made over 40 years and because of the gaps the person gets a pension that is worth peanuts. This lady wants to be able to pay her &euro;253 a year to continue her contribution record. Unfortunately she will not be able to revert to the level of work she wanted, and for which she took articles in accountancy and qualified. I want to ensure she can make her contribution of &euro;253 per annum through the voluntary contributions <Col N="813"/>system so when the day of reckoning comes, she will at least have a pension. As an accountant, the Minister knows the amount is minuscule. Like many of us who went into politics, the Minister might be considerably better off if he had continued as an accountant. I say this as someone from a legal background who would probably be considerably better off had he continued in his former occupation. However, a politician&rsquo;s calling relates to the public work he or she does, which is not often given much credit.</P>
      <P>I was fairly pleased by the Minister&rsquo;s answer to the question asked about carers. Deputy Moynihan-Cronin brought that case to my attention. People are unaware of the many situations in which they can make voluntary contributions. We, and the Department in particular, have failed in not ensuring that this information is made available. As ever, the Minister&rsquo;s officials appear to be working hard to deal with the anomalies raised by us. I apologise for landing this anomaly on them but I only became aware of it this morning.</P>
      <P>I hope this woman&rsquo;s case is covered by the guide to social welfare services. This guide drives me mad and politicians hate searching for information on page 46, but all the information one needs is contained within it. I presume Department officials are good at finding information and know on which page and in which paragraph the information is contained. I hope this guide facilitates this young woman because if it does not, we should amend the regulations.</P>
      <P>One would not find ten people in the country facing the same situation as this young woman and I hope nobody other than her finds themselves in this situation. However, two cases in Waterford and Kerry were brought to my attention. The Minister appears to have dealt with the case relating to carers and has stated that carers can be given the credit and pay the voluntary contribution of &euro;253 per annum. I want to ensure that this young woman, who was at the height of her professional career until she was struck down by an illness which leaves her unable to return to her chosen profession, will be accommodated within the social welfare code by means of the voluntary contributions system. I await the Minister&rsquo;s reply with bated breath, which I hope is in the affirmative. If it is not, I will revisit the matter and ask the Minister to change the regulations to permit her to be accommodated by the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Penrose. In respect of voluntary contributions, a scheme is in place whereby a self-employed person who has paid contributions over the years and moves into full-time employment can make a yearly payment. People should be forewarned about this. I have been self-employed all my working life and nearly lost my entitlements and employment stamps when I entered this House. The matter was raised at an Oireachtas committee and I used my case as an example. I thanked the Depart<Col N="814"/>ment officials who gave me very wise advice, which I heeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ring must have been giving out that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be noted the number of self-employed people who will lose their entitlements because they do not know about this scheme which allows them to make a yearly voluntary contribution to the State. The Department should advise people of the existence of this scheme and let them know that if they make contributions as self-employed people and then enter full-time employment as PAYE workers, they can hold on to their entitlements to a pension by means of this scheme.</P>
      <P>I, like Deputy Penrose, acknowledge that the Minister has done a fairly good job in respect of increasing benefits for the numbers of people who give up work to look after loved ones. He has raised the period for which carer&rsquo;s benefit is payable from 15 months to two years, which is welcome. The increase in the number of hours that full-time carers can work outside the home from ten to 15 hours is another welcome development. The Minister has not done too badly in respect of carers, although a few anomalies still exist.</P>
      <P>I will write to the Minister and his officials about a case involving a person in my constituency who gave up work in the US and returned to this country to look after loved ones but was refused the carer&rsquo;s allowance because they had worked outside the State. However, this person was an Irish citizen, who was born and reared in this country, and should have been considered for the carer&rsquo;s allowance. The Minister and his officials might examine this case. As Deputy Penrose noted, these cases are not numerous. One will only encounter the odd exceptional case. It is terrible that someone such as my constituent would return home to look after a loved one and find that he or she is denied the carer&rsquo;s allowance. I will write to the Minister who might take this case up with his Department to see if anything can be done for this individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak briefly about children as carers, an issue raised by me at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs. The Minister gave a commitment during a previous Question Time and at that committee meeting to examine this matter and take action. This is a very important issue which demands a cross-departmental response from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and, possibly, the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister initiate debate on this issue at Government and Cabinet level to ensure that the scandal of children being forced to care for parents or siblings and possibly carry out many intimate tasks at a very young age to the detri<Col N="815"/>ment of their education and life chances is addressed? The Carers Association and other groups are very concerned about this issue and have brought it to our attention on a number of occasions. If tackling this issue was the only action taken in respect of carers, it would be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Executive should be responsible for supporting children who care for loved ones. If I recall correctly, the Minister said at a meeting of the Committee on Social and Family Affairs that it was not a case of paying children to be carers. We want them to be relieved of the burden of caring for their relatives and for personnel to be made available to ensure that care is made available to people who need it in their homes. I understand that some child carers are as young as 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the case referred to by Deputy Penrose involving the accountant who has, unfortunately, been unwell, paragraph 2.7 on page 30 of the guide to social welfare services deals with voluntary PRSI contributions. According to this paragraph:</P>
      <P LI="1">If an employee or self-employed contributor is no longer covered by compulsory PRSI and they are under the age of 66, they may opt to pay voluntary contributions (VCs). These can help maintain or improve a person&rsquo;s pension entitlements, but they do not provide cover for short-term benefits.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Deputy is aware of this. To become a voluntary contributor, a person needs at least 260 weeks of PRSI paid either in employment or self-employment. The person must apply within 12 months at the end of the tax year during which he or she last paid PRSI or had a PRSI credit. It is difficult to pronounce on the case referred to by Deputy Penrose without knowing all the facts but, if the Deputy wishes, we will examine the case when all the facts become known to us. A total of 260 weeks adds up to more than five years. If the woman in question paid contributions as an employed or self-employed accountant, she could continue to pay them while she is ill. This is the best advice I can give at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it mandatory to give 12 months&rsquo; notification or is there some room for discretion? This is where the provision could fall down because people may not know about its existence. I know that notification cannot be open-ended but is there room for discretion? I hope Department officials treat such cases with a measure of discretion. I know that the 12-month notification rule exists because the Department is attempting to gather information. This woman&rsquo;s case is particularly sad and I urge officials to treat it with whatever discretion is available.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="816"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that a measure of discretion will be exercised in this case, although I am not sure of its extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The woman may also qualify for other benefits. In respect of the case raised by Deputy Ring, the Deputy is aware that the habitual residency rules apply to carers who have worked outside the State. If someone enters this country to become a carer, the Department must assess whether he or she meets the requirements of the habitual residence clause. I do not think we can do much in this area without dealing with the whole HRC issue, which is currently under review. Some 1,446 people pay the voluntary class S contribution of &euro;253 per annum. While the figure is low, there appears to be an ongoing trend upwards in the number of people paying the voluntary contribution.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Deputy Stanton referred to young carers. I agree that special help, advice and support is essential for young carers who are caring for a parent in particular. I recognise that services must be put in place to support the household. We must ensure young carers remain at school. These services include home help, public health nurses and home care packages generally. I said on Committee Stage I will take an interest in the issue. I will try to find out how many people are involved. There should be plenty of household supports so the young person can remain in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the level of interchange on Committee Stage and Report Stage, which is useful. The Minister is quite open in trying to deal with issues, which is why we do not try to be sneaky about taking advantage of someone who tries to participate in debates in a wholesome way. His reply is interesting as far as self-employed people are concerned. I am self-employed and, even though I have done accountancy and so on, we sometimes omit to follow through on what are our rights. The Minister&rsquo;s officials have apprised me as a result of a recent question that if I keep up my other contributions and if I am alive when the day of reckoning comes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be a rich man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose my wife will be rich because I probably will not last that long. It is important to be aware of these matters. The two cases illustrate the importance of information. Some officials might say that one cannot move on the 12 month period, but I hope there will be flexibility. If someone has an illness that threatens their livelihood, the last thing they might be concerned about is voluntary contributions. I hope this case will be pursued and I know the Deputy involved will pursue the matter so that it does not <Col N="817"/>meet with the bureaucratic impediment. As this debate has been useful, I will withdraw amendments Nos. 6 and 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on introducing a disregard of income from Family Income Supplement when applying the spouse means test for the Household Benefit Package.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister was probably surprised that I produced this example. He was probably bored by these types of amendments on Committee Stage. Perhaps if I were in his position, I would go mad as a result of all the amendments being tabled. I assure him that I am not doing so to score points. Our job is to point out where we can improve legislation and improve the availability of benefits for people. Generally, when people reach this stage, they need all the help they can get. If there is a little quirk or anomaly in the system, it is our duty to iron it out because we are sent here as legislators. One might say that some of it is &ldquo;parish pump&rdquo; talk, but one often finds the basis for the best legislation at &ldquo;parish pump&rdquo; level.</P>
      <P>I will use the example of Jack and Jill, a married couple with two children. Jack receives an invalidity pension and his wife works three days a week over 19 hours to supplement the family income. On the other days, she cares for her husband who is ill, which is why he is receiving invalidity pension. She works over 19 hours, therefore, she can apply for FIS. These are the parameters that apply. The family qualifies for the free schemes on the basis of Jack&rsquo;s invalidity pension. As he is an invalid, the household benefits package applies, once his wife&rsquo;s earnings do not exceed &euro;220 a week. Because she worked three days a week for &euro;220 and had two children, she qualified for FIS. However, her income from the family income supplement will be counted as means for the household benefits package. This means she loses the household benefits package. I believe this is an unintended consequence of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Someone on invalidity pension who is quite ill will qualify for the household benefits package. If the person&rsquo;s wife works 20 hours a week, say, four hours a day, the family will be entitled to family income supplement because she may be earning &euro;9 an hour, or &euro;118 a week, but the income from family income supplement is thrown into the pot in the assessment for the household benefits package. The fact that the income from FIS <Col N="818"/>denies the family its entitlement to the household benefits package is an oversight which undermines the whole purpose of FIS.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on the advertising campaign he has undertaken to ensure the FIS mechanism, and the importance of the scheme as a supplementary form of income for many families who have relatively low incomes, is being made known.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Ring compliment the Minister recently. As it was the first time I heard him pay such a fulsome tribute, perhaps the Minister should be grateful for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>He took on board my advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is the west of Ireland air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Photographs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>There were no photographs of the Minister which was the Deputy&rsquo;s <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> in regard to his predecessor. He used to become apoplectic when he would see photographs. It used to send him off the rails. He admonished the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor in fairly forthright terms, as only he can.</P>
      <P>The Minister is doing his job in regard to FIS, which is welcome. However, one of the unintended consequences should be reviewed. The solution is simple, namely, to disregard the income from FIS in the means test for the household benefits package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the way in which FIS is being promoted through the advertising campaign. It will be interesting to see what the take-up will be. We all have people coming to our clinics on a weekly basis who are in dire straits financially. They find it a great help when we inform them about family income supplement.</P>
      <P>I have a question for the Minister on family income supplement which he may be able to answer. It is linked to the new child care supplement. Is someone from Spain who is working here on a low income and who has three children in Spain entitled to claim and receive family income supplement if their income levels are in order? Is there anyone from outside the State, who is working here currently claiming and receiving family income supplement? Does it come under the same umbrella as the child care supplement in line with family payments under EU agreements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s example, what would the Minister suggest a family do in such a situation? The family income supplement is supposed to benefit a family but if the family in the example Deputy Penrose gave avails of it, it will not benefit and its income will be reduced. That is an anomaly and a large number of people do not avail of the family <Col N="819"/>income supplement. Is this one of the reasons families do not avail of the family income supplement? Would the Minister recommend that families do not avail of the family income supplement which is supposed to support people on low incomes? I am interested to hear his reply.</P>
      <P>It is a crazy situation and it is the role of an Opposition spokesperson to raise it. I commend Deputy Penrose on coming up with this example. While it may be rare enough, it does occur. I am interested to know how many families are in the same situation because we know there is a low take-up of family income supplement. In the majority of cases, people are not aware of the supplement. However, those who are aware of their entitlements are afraid to avail of them because it will affect one of their other benefits. We need to eliminate this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Deputies Penrose and Stanton, I welcome the advertisement campaign. It is an issue I have raised on many occasions in this House. Last summer I sent out a leaflet to my constituents and the number of people who took up the scheme was amazing. I did a radio interview yesterday, following which my office received five or six queries regarding the family income supplement. The other day the Minister made a valid point that if somebody on &euro;16,000 per year avails of the family income supplement, it is worth &euro;5,000 per year to him or her. Thousands of people are entitled to take up the scheme. To qualify for the scheme, one must be in work and have children. However, many people who are working do not want to take up a social welfare payment, which is foolish. We should promote this scheme.</P>
      <P>The other issue I wish to raise with the Minister, as I did the other day, is the household benefit package and the fuel scheme, which is means tested. A number of my constituents and those of other Deputies who worked for local authorities, health boards or other State agencies get a contributory pension and a small pension from the council, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, etc. Although these people have paid their dues, they are debarred from availing of the fuel scheme as it is means tested and they are over the income limit as a result of their pensions. It is an issue the Minister should consider. People who have paid their dues to the State and have a contributory pension and a small pension from the local authority or otherwise are aggravated about their ineligibility for the fuel scheme because they are slightly over the income limit. The Minister should consider this issue to be fair to people who have paid their dues to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Penrose again pointed out a number of apparent anomalies. We are trying to iron out as many of them as possible. Almost 18 months ago I said the experience of Deputies, Senators and councillors &mdash; our public <Col N="820"/>representatives &mdash; is a great treasure trove. I have taken careful note of every anomaly and proposal made by members of my parliamentary party and by others in this House. I have asked my officials to go through every one of those raised on Committee Stage, by members of my parliamentary party and in the corridors of the House to see if a policy lesson can be learned from those examples. There is no point trying to deal with a specific example. I will continue to audit those points to see if we can iron out those anomalies. I will not be able to iron out some of them but I will others.</P>
      <P>I do not need an army of consultants because the best advice comes from our clinics and from the people we meet every day. I do not say that in a patronising way but that is the case. We should put the real life cases raised in the House, at committees, in party rooms and in the corridors of the House to the test in terms of policy. I give the Deputies that reassurance again because it is the best way to go. If I can tackle a range of issues brought to my attention by Deputies in a policy context and in a way which will make people&rsquo;s lives better and if we iron out the anomalies, that is the best contribution we can make and much better than any major reports presented to me in the course of the job.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton referred to Spain in his example. The advice I have is that we would have to pay the family income supplement in that circumstance. Technically, it is a family benefit under EU Regulation 1408/71 along with the new child care allowance and child benefit. The person must be working, have an economic interest and be rooted here. If his or her family happens to be in Spain or somewhere else, he or she will qualify for the family income supplement. That is the effect of EU Regulation 1408/71. We are trying to establish the numbers in this area to track them. I do not have the numbers to hand but the child care and the child benefit numbers are not a cause of concern as they are not large. The last time I looked at the numbers, they did not greatly concern me as there is no sense that people are flocking here to get the rates to send the money back to other countries. That does not seem to be the case. We are being, and should continue to be, generous to people who come to our shores and we should integrate them, which we have a good chance of doing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring pointed to something we all know. If one has other income on top of one&rsquo;s pension, it can cost one the fuel allowance. The Deputy asked that if the other income is small, perhaps it could be considered. That is something we can do. If the income is large, it is right one would not qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister acknowledged that most of the anomalies are brought to his attention by Deputies from his party and the Opposition. I raised the following anomaly with four previous Ministers. A person was in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance as she was looking after <Col N="821"/>a relative of her husband in her house. The relative was doubly incontinent and bedridden. Her husband was killed in a road accident and she qualified for the widow&rsquo;s pension the following week. However, as soon as she qualified for the widow&rsquo;s pension, she lost the carer&rsquo;s allowance even though she continued to be a full-time carer.</P>
      <P>I have brought this anomaly to the attention of this Minister and the four previous Ministers. While the person being cared for in this case has passed on to his eternal reward, this anomaly should be corrected for future cases. In a reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister said there could not be many such cases and replies to other parliamentary questions stated that one could not receive two social welfare payments. There cannot be too many cases where a carer has lost the carer&rsquo;s allowance because her husband has died. This case involved a small farmer. Not only was this woman at a disadvantage because she lost her husband tragically, she had to employ somebody to do her meagre farm work as she was caring for her husband&rsquo;s relative full-time. She was penalised for the fact that her husband died. If he can, the Minister should eliminate this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult enough being in a small party at the best of times but this morning I had a briefing from the Minister of State on the proposed charities Bill and the Committee of Public Accounts sat at the same time. I have been viewing proceedings from elsewhere in the House and I wish to comment on amendment No. 8.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I stated that it was unfortunate that we were dealing with the Bill without hearing firm proposals from the Minister in regard to the combination of child dependant allowance and family income supports. Many of us on this side of the House hope that those proposals will come forward as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With the public information campaign now proceeding on the family income supplement, FIS, has the Minister set himself benchmarks in regard to how the uptake of FIS might increase in the coming year? We are aware that the current uptake may be as low as 30%. When I questioned the Secretary General of the Department on the uptake recently I was surprised to learn that the amount put aside in the Book of Estimates coincides with the amount that was paid out in the preceding years. If we are serious about FIS we must have a ballpark figure of people&rsquo;s entitlements if they choose to take it up fully. I suspect the impact of the Minister&rsquo;s publicity campaign will require him bringing a Supplementary Estimate before the House later in the year. Will he indicate when this will be delivered and how much extra he thinks will be required as a result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy McCormack, I do not want to go over the debate about the half rate again as I dealt with it a few moments ago. In the example the Deputy gave, the person <Col N="822"/>concerned would not necessarily have to lose the carer&rsquo;s allowance. She could keep the carer&rsquo;s allowance, which is now &euro;200 if she is over 65 but she would not be entitled to the widow&rsquo;s pension. It would be one or the other. It depends on how one says it. She could, in theory, keep the carer&rsquo;s allowance of &euro;200, which is higher than the widow&rsquo;s pension of &euro;170.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>There is &euro;13 of a difference for caring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the point. We will not go through it again. We had a good debate a few moments ago on the reasoning behind not making two payments. Deputy McCormack may wish to look at the transcripts of that debate. I will find another occasion to go through the matter with the Deputy if he wishes.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s question on the FIS, 17,445 people are currently in receipt of this payment. The number has been increasing. It is difficult to put an estimate on it but one guesstimate is that there may be another 20,000 people who are entitled to it. We have had a very good initial response to our advertising campaign. I will report to the House as soon as I have some numbers. I do expect the number to increase dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Department&rsquo;s double payment rule the Minister maintains it is not possible to pay the widow&rsquo;s pension at the same time as the carer&rsquo;s or other allowance or pension. Is this rule set down in legislation or is it more of a convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a good debate but I forewarn the Minister that I have prepared a booklet of social welfare anomalies. That is all I will say to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>A best-seller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be a best-seller. I do not want it to be a best-seller, I want to see the pages disappearing out of it as quickly as I print them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a better seller if the problems were solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Penrose will have to vote for the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Vote for the budget. With due respect, I have referred to eight or nine of the anomalies in the amendments. In fairness, the Minister cannot deal with them today because, as he said, the pot is gone. I have acknowledged that the Minister is trying to deal with a complex area in a far more caring way than did his predecessor. In that context I will withdraw the amendment <Col N="823"/>because I trust the Minister will examine the matter.</P>
      <P>I do so with this caveat, FIS is important and if somebody looking after a person in receipt of invalidity pension gets FIS and this deprives him or her of the household benefits package we are dealing with a circular bird. As Deputy Crowe stated, people are encouraged to apply for FIS but it may result in them losing their household benefits package. This pushes people into an either-or situation. We want to ensure that whatever they get helps them and anybody who is an invalid and is not able to work should find the household benefits package a useful adjunct. If I recall correctly, the Minister said the household benefits package for a family is worth about &euro;980 per year, which is about &euro;19 per week. We acknowledge that this is worth something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The average FIS payment is about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the household benefits package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>The household benefits package is worth &euro;19 per week but if a woman got &euro;30 in FIS she would lose &euro;19 in the household benefits package. There is an old saying in Westmeath that sometimes the head is not worth the wash. That may well be the case here. In this context I withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on ensuring Parents on Child Benefit Book Payments claim their final child benefit payment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is an unusual situation. Following an investigation of the matter, the Minister was made <Col N="824"/>aware by his officials that 1,800 people do not claim the final payment in respect of the last month of their youngest child. It only affects those people on book payments. The people who use modern electronic means of transfer are not affected. The officials were quite adamant about this. I watched them on Committee Stage. Body language can reveal a great deal. They were adamant on this point.</P>
      <P>The problem arises when students finish the leaving certificate. I am quite sure the book only runs from June to May and I am not usually that far wrong. The officials suggested that people just need to go to the post office but in order to get the final payment people may well have to get a certificate from the school to confirm the student&rsquo;s attendance. Students can drop out at any stage. I contacted the Minister about a case where a young girl dropped out of college but returned to school to gain extra points. The reply stated that child benefit would not be paid because she was not in recognised educational establishment. The Minister cannot tell me this does not happen because it does. It has been shown that 1,800 people do not claim their final child benefit payment. We are saying information in this regard should be furnished to the people concerned.</P>
      <P>The one reason we will vote against the Bill at 1.30 p.m. is the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to abolish the pre-retirement allowance. We did it on Committee Stage and we will do it again. We are wholeheartedly against this unwarranted proposal. It is one of the only ideological arguments the Minister has against us. We can usually reach a consensus but in this instance the Minister indicated he would not compromise. We voted against the proposal on Committee Stage. We are consistent on this. We believe it is the wrong move. It is a <i>fait accompli</i> and therefore we are voting against the Bill because of the position the Minister has adopted on the abolition of the pre-retirement allowance.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P><Col N="826"/>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to address the House on the occasion of the Second Reading of the National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill 2006. The Bill before the House provides for the establishment of the National Sports Campus Development Authority, which will succeed in function and responsibility the present limited company, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, known as CSID, and continue the role of overseeing, planning and developing a sports campus at Abbotstown.</P>
      <P>Sport is our great national passion and involvement in sport provides a source of well-being and emotional outlet for people of every age and from every corner of the country. It is a great character builder and acts as an antidote to anti-social behaviour. Beyond the intrinsic value of participation in sport, it is also a key element in social and economic life. Active participation in competitive or recreational sport contributes enormously to the physical and mental well-being of the individual and, by extension, the whole community and nation. Success at national and international competition creates a sense of pride, <Col N="827"/>excites interest and raises morale. Involvement in sport creates a sense of unity and identity for communities, towns and villages in every part of the country. The achievements of our top competitors and the hard work, commitment and dedication which lie behind their success all serve to inspire, encourage and raise the spirits of us all. Young people in particular need role models and heroes who will inspire and encourage them.</P>
      <P>Sports funding for 2006 exceeds &euro;243.295 million, with the Irish Sports Council budget increased to &euro;40.9 million, the local authority swimming pools and sports capital programmes allocated &euro;100 million and the horseracing and greyhound industries receiving &euro;70.1 million. An amount of &euro;20 million is provided in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2006 for the IRFU-FAI led project for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium, to which the Government has agreed to provide funding of &euro;191 million, phased over five years.</P>
      <P>The Government has spent more than &euro;750 million on sport since 1997. Between 1998 and 2004, a total of almost &euro;331 million was allocated to more than 4,721 projects throughout the country under the sports capital programme. Under the local authority swimming pools programme, 18 swimming pool projects have been completed since 2000 and many more are under way at locations throughout the country. The annual sports budget has increased from &euro;17 million in 1997 to &euro;243.295 million in 2006.</P>
      <P>We have made considerable progress in bringing our sporting infrastructure into line with best international standards. I am particularly pleased that substantial funding continues to be made available for continued investment in sports facilities in order that, at last, we will have modern well equipped and well managed sporting facilities. The enactment of the Bill and the development of the Abbotstown sports campus will contribute to the provision of modern, well equipped and well managed sporting facilities which will attract many more people into sport.</P>
      <P>On the Abbotstown sports campus, the House will recall that in January 2004 the Government decided to proceed with the development of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown. Having consulted widely with the major governing bodies of sport, stakeholders and interest groups, CSID, the company charged with developing the project, drew up proposals for the phased development of a sports campus at Abbotstown. During the consultation process it became clear that top class sports facilities to cater for both elite professional and recreational sports people are needed at national level. At the same time, a wide range of facilities need to be provided, which would be available to the national governing bodies of sport and the local community for individual and community related sports. On 15 November 2005, the Government decided to proceed over a five year period with the development of phase one <Col N="828"/>of the sports campus at Abbotstown as set out in the development control plan prepared by CSID. Phase one of the plan will provide: a national field sports training centre catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a national indoor training centre which will provide world class training facilities for more than 30 governing bodies of sport, such as badminton, basketball, bowling, boxing, judo and table tennis; accommodation for sports men and women; sports science and medical facilities; and all weather synthetic pitches for community use. This phase of the sports campus is part of a necklace of sporting facilities to be located at Abbotstown, of which the National Aquatic Centre is a key component.</P>
      <P>The dedicated space to be provided for Gaelic games, rugby, soccer and hockey is presented as a shamrock concept to be developed around a central core building which will be shared by all the elite training sports teams and athletes. This central core will provide living accommodation, restaurant, fitness training, gyms, sports medical and recovery areas. Dedicated changing and training facilities and pitches will be clustered around this block. A range of pitches will be provided in each of the three dedicated areas to ensure that teams can train in a secure and private location in any weather conditions. There will be natural turf and synthetic pitches, some of which will be floodlit. A multi-functional national indoor training centre will be provided, with changing facilities, a sports hall with 1,500 spectator seats and an ancillary hall suitable for a wide range of indoor sports. It is intended that the training requirements of up to 30 national governing bodies will be met in this centre.</P>
      <P>The development control plan is the blueprint for a campus of sporting excellence at Abbotstown. The primary aim of the sports campus is to provide world class sports facilities for Irish sportsmen and women so that they can train and prepare for competition at the highest level. The development will be a key element of a co-ordinated strategy in partnership with the Irish Sports Council and the national governing bodies of sport to promote sporting excellence and participation. Our sportsmen and women are entitled to the best of facilities and supports if they are to compete successfully at national and international competitions. For teams and individuals to succeed at the highest level, there is a need to put in place a support system capable of identifying and developing potential by providing access to a professional and administrative structure and a network of coaches and facilities. Reports on the performance of Irish athletes at the Sydney and Athens Olympic Games concluded that the existing support system in Ireland falls well short of best international practice. Accordingly, a holistic environment in which to train and prepare for world class competition is required to break through to a more success driven system. The facilities must be on a par with facilities available to athletes in other countries. A failure to invest <Col N="829"/>in cutting edge sports facilities means that Irish sportsmen and women will continue to be disadvantaged when competing at the highest level. The facilities the Government intends to develop at Abbotstown will rival those available anywhere else in Europe or beyond.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s blueprint for high performance sport in Ireland is set out in its high performance strategy. A key element of this strategy is the identified requirement to put in place systems and infrastructure to enable Ireland&rsquo;s best athletes to fulfil their potential. The ISC has recognised the need for state-of-the-art services and facilities if the strategy is to succeed. The Athens review has acknowledged the commitment of the Government to the delivery of a modern sporting infrastructure and advocates a further stepping up of investment in elite sport facilities. The development of the proposed facilities at the National Sports Campus will be the central feature of our planned investment strategy for elite sport.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s strategic goals are built around the concept of participation, performance and excellence. They pose a challenge to all agencies involved with sport to consider their objectives, structures and strategies in pursuit of these goals. For Ireland to produce teams and individuals who win at the highest levels, we will need professionally administered organisations with an effective strategy to generate participation, investment and commitment in our sports men and women. We will also need a network of facilities from local to national level to be built around the concept of a centre of excellence, such as that proposed for the National Sports Campus.</P>
      <P>There are growing concerns in Ireland and internationally about the low level of physical activity, particularly among young people, and obesity has become a critical public health concern. In this regard, investment in sport can yield a very tangible return in improved fitness and health for the individual, with a consequent reduction in the demand on health services. It can at the same time provide a channel to reduce anti-social behaviour and encourage personal development and the generation of community and team spirit.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The selection of London as the host city for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games and Paralympic Games opens up opportunities for us to present Ireland as a high quality centre for elite athletes and teams as they finalise their preparations for Olympic competitions. This will only come about if early planning is undertaken and opportunities are recognised. I have been made aware by the Olympic Council of Ireland that a number of national teams have indicated that they would consider using Ireland as a base leading up to the games. Participants wishing to prepare for games look for locations which are not directly caught up in the hype of Olympic preparations in the host country but which provide climatic con<Col N="830"/>ditions similar to those likely to be experienced at the Olympic rounds. This country is ideally situated to fulfil this requirement.</P>
      <P>However, if Ireland is to be attractive to potential participating athletes, high quality sporting and residential accommodation such as those currently planned for development in the first phase for a sports campus at Abbotstown and the proposed Irish Institute of Sport will need to be available in time to be effectively marketed. Some such facilities already exist in the University of Limerick and I understand that the university&rsquo;s authorities are developing plans for adding to these facilities. I am also setting up a high level group which will be mandated to promote the attractions of Ireland as a high quality locations for Olympic preparations. I need hardly mention the potential business and tourism gains to be realised.</P>
      <P>Funds for the delivery of the campus project have been provided in my Department&rsquo;s capital envelope for 2006 to 2010. The estimated cost of the project is &euro;119 million, with a four to five year delivery schedule. This year, expenditure of almost &euro;10 million will be incurred as the project gets under way. I met the board of CSID on 8 December 2005 to discuss the realisation of the plans for Abbotstown and have urged it to progress the project at full speed. I pay tribute to the members of the board, and its chairman, Mr. Con Haugh, for their dedication to the project and work in bringing it to this stage.</P>
      <P>Already, discussions have been held with Fingal County Council on planning and zoning issues. The Fingal county development plan contains a specific objective for the lands at Abbotstown. This objective obliges the county council to &ldquo;undertake a study to determine a suitable mix of sporting and appropriate commercial, leisure and amenity uses in order to create a vibrant and sustainable sports campus.&rdquo; This study shall also &ldquo;investigate the possibility of opening up these lands for recreation use for the residents of the greater Blanchardstown area.&rdquo; Under the chairmanship of the OPW, a group consisting of CSID, Fingal County Council, the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food and my Department have commenced the preparation of the study, which we intend to complete by the end of May. The study will investigate the scope for opening up the Abbotstown lands for recreational use by residents of the greater Blanchardstown area. Deputies will be aware that this is a rapidly growing area with a population that is already greater than the size of Limerick. It is important that we do not allow growth to get out of control and that we put in place the support structures to support that growth, particularly in the areas of sport and recreation. One of the advantages of this study is that it will provide a framework against which individual planning applications will be considered. It will highlight where zonings may need to be changed to facilitate the optimum development of the site. <Col N="831"/>The process of the study will involve the preparation of a draft for public consultation and approval of the elected members. Fingal County Council&rsquo;s objective is that public consultation will commence no later than July and I am confident the deadline can be achieved.</P>
      <P>The development control plan proposes to retain the buildings already on site which might be adapted for use as administrative offices. I fully support this proposal and it makes eminent sense to utilise these buildings. The Government decision gave approval for the use of the former State laboratory building at Abbotstown as a possible location for new headquarters for the FAl. The organisation is currently located in Merrion Square and is anxious to move to more adequate and spacious headquarters. Deputies will also be aware that the FAl is interested in developing a football academy on the site. Discussions to facilitate this are already advanced and involve my Department together with the OPW, the Department of Agriculture and Food, as well as FAl and CSID. This will be a timely move and will reflect the new direction and vision of the association. It is my intention that the national headquarters will be in operation in Abbotstown before the end of this year. In addition to providing the sports facilities I have listed, the Government also gave approval for the provision of a parcel of not more than three acres of land on the Abbotstown site, adjacent to the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, to build a hospice. Discussions have commenced between CSID and the voluntary hospice group St. Francis Hospice to agree a suitable site. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and others have been particularly interested in that matter.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>A key requirement for the success of the campus is that the national sporting organisations and relevant stakeholders will use the proposed facilities to their fullest extent. There has been broad support for the campus among the national governing bodies, as is evidenced in the development control plan. Detailed discussions have also commenced between CSID and the national governing bodies of sport that will use the proposed facilities on the campus to agree details of their specific requirements and put in place user agreements with them.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the national sports campus development authority is a further important step in the Government&rsquo;s plan for the development of national sports facilities and programmes.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the House, I will go through the various sections. The Bill contains three parts. Part 1, Preliminary and General, covers sections 1 to 4, inclusive. This part contains standard provisions regarding Short Title and definitions of key terms used in the Bill. It also provides for the <Col N="832"/>laying of orders made by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Part 2 covers sections 5 to 30, inclusive, and deals with the establishment of the authority, describes the authority&rsquo;s functions, provides for the transfer of the Abbotstown site from the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the new authority and the membership of the authority. Sections 5 and 6 provide for the making of an order by the Minister to set a day for the establishment of the authority, which will be known as the national sports campus development authority, and which will have, with the approval of the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land and other property.</P>
      <P>Section 7 describes the authority&rsquo;s functions. The primary functions of the authority will be to develop a sports campus on the site; to furnish and equip it; to manage, operate and maintain it; and to encourage and promote its use by professional and amateur sports people and members of the public alike. The authority may develop facilities and services of a commercial nature, complementary to the sports campus, arrange for the development of medical and research facilities for sport on the site or elsewhere or arrange for use of the site by a national sports body for purposes connected with sport.</P>
      <P>A development plan for the campus must be submitted for the approval of the Minister and the Government and before the commencement of each phase, details of which must also be submitted for approval. Section 7 also provides for the conveyance of the site currently owned by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the authority and that pending such conveyance, the authority may develop the land. Schedule 1 contains a description of the land at Abbotstown owned by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>Sections 9, 10, 11 and 13 provide for the establishment of a board consisting of a chairperson and 12 members and also for the appointment of a chief executive. The chairperson will hold office for a period of five years, the ordinary members first appointed to the board will hold office for periods between three and five years, but thereafter any appointments will be for a period of five years.</P>
      <P>The powers given to the authority are provided for in various sections of Part 2. Under section 8, the authority is empowered to enter into agreements with others to carry out its functions, make charges, recover debts and engage consultants. Section 11 provides the right to establish committees to assist it in the performance of its functions. Sections 14 and 15 provide for the appointment of staff, with the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Section 25 gives the authority power to withhold consent to renewal of a lease or tenancy where such lease or tenancy would prejudice the running of the site. Section 28 provides for the establishment of subsidiaries, a company, or the <Col N="833"/>entering of a joint venture, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance. Section 29 allows the authority to borrow with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance. Section 30 gives the authority the power to acquire by agreement land adjoining the site for access purposes or, if authorised by an order of the Minister made under Schedule 2 of this Act, the right to acquire such land compulsorily.</P>
      <P>Section 18 contains the standard prohibitions on members of the authority holding political office, either at local, national or European level, and also provides for secondment arrangements where persons employed by the authority secure election to office at these levels. Section 19 empowers the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to advance funding provided by the Oireachtas to the authority. Sections 20 to 22, inclusive, contain standard provisions to the submission of audited accounts and annual reports to the Minister, which the Minister will subsequently lay before each House of the Oireachtas. The accounts of the authority will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Section 24 allows the Minister to give general policy directions to the authority.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill also requires the attendance of the chief executive before Oireachtas committees and the Committee of Public Accounts in sections 20 and 21; the disclosure of beneficial interests by members, staff, consultants, etc. in section 16; and the non-disclosure of confidential information except as required by law and application of freedom of information legislation in sections 17 and 23. Part 3 deals with transitional provisions and covers sections 31 to 38, inclusive. This part provides for the dissolution of CSID and the transfer of existing staff to the new authority. CSID, soon to be the national sports campus development authority, has already begun the process of delivering a range of facilities to be used by elite athletes and the sporting public.</P>
      <P>Ireland is on track to provide state-of-the-art-facilities for sports men and women to train and prepare for competition at the highest level. A considerable effort had been put into the discussion and planning stage of the project, which has been given the green light by the Government. This development is crucial to the future development of sport. The proposals for the campus are exciting and I am looking forward to their realisation.</P>
      <P>I also look forward to a scenario in the context of the London Olympics of 2012 whereby Ireland, with these state-of-the-art facilities, will offer an attractive option as a training base for international Olympic teams in the years leading up to the staging of the games in London in 2012. In commending the Bill to the House I apologise to the main spokespersons for my inability to stay for their contributions. I must attend a function which has been organised for a long time. I will read with great care the statements of the Opposition spokespersons with regard to the Bill with <Col N="834"/>a view to possible amendments. My colleague, the Minister of State and the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, will represent me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is excused. I hope he does not have to travel by air or he may be back with us again.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome this Bill, which will provide for the establishment of the national sports campus development authority on a statutory basis. I join the Minister in recognising the work of Mr. Con Haugh and his officials in bringing the development to this stage, and his stewardship of the project over the past five years or so.</P>
      <P>The primary functions of the authority will be to develop a sports campus on the Abbotstown site; to furnish and equip it; manage, operate, and maintain it; and encourage and promote its use by professional and amateur sports people and members of the public alike. The campus will provide a central building, which will include living accommodation, gymnasia, fitness training and sports medical and recovery areas. It will also provide training areas for rugby, soccer and GAA and hockey field games. Each of the three areas will have a range of natural turf and synthetic pitches, some floodlit, which will allow teams to train in secure, private locations. The plan also envisages a national indoor training centre and a sports hall that will host over 30 indoor sports, with a capacity of 1,000 spectators.</P>
      <P>The development of Sports Campus Ireland is certainly a significant development as Ireland lags some considerable distance behind its principal competitors in the provision of training facilities and coaching expertise for our elite and emerging athletes. We are only beginning to catch up in recent years with the establishment of the NCTC and the provision of the 50-metre swimming pool in Limerick, the National Aquatic Centre in Abbotstown, the National Rowing Centre at Inniscarra, the R&iacute;ocht running track at Castleisland, County Kerry and the National Hockey Arena at UCD. However, we are still light years behind counterparts, including the UK, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, former east European bloc countries, Russia and others.</P>
      <P>New Zealand, for example, has a similar population, but we lag behind it in terms of expertise and facilities. That is reflected in New Zealand&rsquo;s performance in world sport, be it in rugby, Olympic sports, hockey or cricket. It will take years of sustained and targeted investment to develop a range of top class facilities to enable our athletes to train in Ireland and compete successfully on a world stage. Currently, many of our athletes who wish to succeed on an international level must go to other countries, the US in particular. Some athletes would like to stay or study here, if only facilities were available. We must give our athletes a choice if we are to exploit all the talent available in this country. I will refer to this in greater detail later. Some athletes would <Col N="835"/>stay and study in Ireland if they had the facilities. We must give our athletes this choice if we are to exploit all the talent available to us.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The campus will also provide office accommodation for many of our national governing bodies of sport. The FAI, in particular, is very enthusiastic about moving its headquarters to the existing State Laboratory building at Abbotstown. It is trying to operate from two locations. Its current headquarters in Merrion Square are cramped and outmoded. As a result of these conditions, the FAI has to hold most of its meetings in hotels, which is an unnecessary drain on its resources. Its technical and club licensing departments work from offices at Dublin Airport. This is not the way for a modern sporting organisation to do its business. The provision of an administrative headquarters at Abbotstown will immediately solve this problem by bringing together various departments and affiliates under the one roof. This will streamline operations and build on the synergies that will exist from having its staff together.</P>
      <P>Abbotstown will also be the location of the FAI&rsquo;s national academies, where the top under age players from throughout Ireland will come together for intensive coaching and training sessions. The provision of residential accommodation will mean that these sessions can be held over a number of days as players will be able to stay on site. All its international squads and emerging talent programme participants will be able to avail of this.</P>
      <P>However, not all sporting organisations have their future plans tied into the campus development. The Athletics Association of Ireland continues to pursue its own plans for an indoor arena and a new headquarters at the national athletics stadium in Santry.</P>
      <P>The Golfing Union of Ireland is going ahead with its plans for a &euro;5.5 million headquarters and golf academy at Carton House in Maynooth. The general secretary of the GUI said recently that the campus will be of no advantage to his organisation. We have not heard from other organisations but some will find it advantageous to locate in Abbotstown while others will not.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister said the existing buildings on the site in Abbotstown will be used as much as possible by the organisations that will set up there. I am particularly pleased that the FAI will use the fine State Laboratory building. There are fine buildings on the site in Abbotstown and it would be a waste of resources if they had to be demolished to make way for new buildings. Some of them are so well designed they should be the subject of preservation orders.</P>
      <P>While welcoming this Bill, it must be placed in the context of a longer term national plan or vision for the development of elite sport in this country. The Bill, as I am sure the Minister will agree, is not an end in itself. The campus, when developed, must be seen as part of an overall <Col N="836"/>national sporting infrastructure. It must be linked to the national training and coaching centre in Limerick and other designated regional centres so that all our athletes and those with potential, including those who are attending primary and post-primary schools, will have access to the necessary training facilities, coaching personnel and other back-up support within reasonable reach of their homes.</P>
      <P>A young, talented player at any sport needs good coaching that involves nutrition, training programmes and appropriate competition, and must also attend school. I will mention an aspect of the development of our elite sportspeople which is sometimes not taken into consideration. I have recently received feedback from parents of particularly gifted young athletes. Irish parents are discerning and placing their children&rsquo;s eggs in a sporting basket is a risk that most will not take lightly. We need, therefore, to develop facilities at local and national level to accommodate the particular circumstances of a study-sport balance. If somebody is involved in sport while at the same time striving for academic achievement, sacrifices are needed and a balance needs to be struck. The only way to achieve that is to have facilities as close as possible to where a person studies and lives. For that reason, Campus Ireland will not be the complete solution, though it will be an important part of promoting elite sport in this country.</P>
      <P>Other countries have special dedicated schools for exceptionally talented students. We are probably too small to go that route, but we can provide a better structure to nurture this talent by focusing better supports at local, regional and national levels. Talented young people cannot travel long distances on a regular basis to access the support services they need. It is a long journey from west Cork, Donegal or south Kerry to Dublin. It is unfair to ask young people to travel from different corners of the country to Campus Ireland on a weekly basis, although they may be able to do so on a quarterly basis, so the facilities will have to be provided elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Even in Dublin, as we know, getting from one side of city to the other every day is almost impossible for children trying to pursue their chosen sport. I was recently speaking to a member of the UCD rowing club, which trains at Islandbridge. At times it takes them one and a half hours to get there from college by public transport. Then they have to return, which takes up a considerable amount of their time, especially at examination time. That is why we should have a spatial sports strategy for the provision of facilities for the nurturing of our future elite sportspeople. We need to establish one stop shops at a local level. There, young people could access coaching, regular monitoring of training, information on nutrition and, especially, advice on how to balance a study-sport lifestyle that will not impede their future opportunities for earning a <Col N="837"/>living after they have finished their elite sporting career.</P>
      <P>In this regard we could learn from other countries, such as the Netherlands, where elite athletes are provided with a structured support system that ensures there is suitable employment at the other end of what is often only a few years at the elite end of sport. They manage to do this by encouraging companies to adopt their sporting elite. There is a payback for both the companies and the individual sports player in such a system. This could be encouraged through modest changes in the tax system.</P>
      <P>The proposed Irish institute of sport must also figure prominently in any future vision of elite sports policy in this country. I am glad the Minister referred to the proposed institute. I have been trying to raise this question with the Minister in the House for the past year but my questions have been disallowed because the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office said the Minister had no responsibility for the institute. He has confirmed today that he does have responsibility so the next time I ask a question about the Irish institute of sport, I hope it will be accepted.</P>
      <P>The Athens review report of March 2005 recommended the establishment of such an institute with a view to establishing a sustainable infrastructure for the long-term development and support of the high performance system in Ireland. Following the publication of the Athens review report, the Irish Sports Council undertook a comprehensive consultation process to develop detailed proposals for the establishment of an institute of sport. The Sports Council appointed two committees to produce the proposals &mdash; an advisory group and a strategic technical group. The groups included many overseas experts with an in-depth knowledge of sports institutes, including Roslyn Carbon, former medical director with the English Institute of Sport, and Brian Miller, a member of the British athletics sports science panel. The work of both groups has been completed and the report on the proposals for the establishment of an Irish institute of sport has been approved by the board of the Irish Sports Council and is with the Minister for his approval. I call on the Minister through his leading official and the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to make this a priority. In fairness to him, the Minister has put in place many important parts of our arts and sports infrastructure including the refurbishment of Lansdowne Road, but this is a critical matter. I appeal to the Minister to put it in place as soon as possible as it will not incur a significant cost.</P>
      <P>Through the Minister of State, who comes from the Clare constituency and will have an interest in this matter, I call on the Minister to designate the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick as the national institute of sport. The facilities proposed for the institute are an extension of what the National Coaching and Training Centre has endeavoured to provide in recent <Col N="838"/>years but without the required funding. The NCTC should be provided with the necessary additional funding to employ the sports science and medical staff envisaged for the institute.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I also suggest a hub site should be established in Dublin as part of the same management structure. There are many opportunities to create a hub in Dublin. For example, the new Campus Ireland could be an ideal site. Dublin City University has an advanced, elite department and has developed its athletics programme successfully without much help or assistance and UCD has a well structured sports programme. Given that the NCTC has been established in Limerick, it would be timely to give it recognition and provide the proper facilities and resources to allow it to develop into an institute of sport.</P>
      <P>Every country is examining Australia&rsquo;s model for an institute of sport, which has been successful. We should examine that model as much as possible. A number of institutes of sport in England also operate successfully. Investment in coaches and residential training should also occur as part of this development. The new structure could link to the Northern Ireland institute of sport as part of an all-island approach and to the UK network of institutes in the lead up to the 2012 London Olympics. In addition, investment should be made in national governing bodies, NGBs, to maximise their coaching structures and performance management capabilities. Regional nodes should be set up linking to the NGB regional squad structures and the established network of sports science and medical supports.</P>
      <P>Creating another structure could lead to a dilution of focus. In other words, designating another structure as an institute of sport would lead to unnecessary duplication and a waste of resources, particularly when that structure is already in place. I am saying this as it is the right option and not because I went to a physical education college in Limerick or have an affinity for or connection to the University of Limerick in some way. Apart from the NCTC, Limerick has a university, a college of science, an arena &mdash; one of the finest facilities in Ireland &mdash; and the boathouse being developed by Limerick&rsquo;s rowing club. All of the facilities are in place. Limerick also has good access compared to Abbotstown. Two reasons people such as I argued against siting a national stadium in Abbotstown were access and traffic congestion, which the campus development could also experience. For this reason I am making a strong argument for the designation of the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick as the Irish institute of sport. This is the most sensible way forward.</P>
      <P>I will speak on a subject that is probably not very popular in the House but must be addressed, that is, the new authority to have responsibility for the National Aquatic Centre. I suggest the authority carries out an independent expert review of the reported defects and severe leaking of highly chlorinated pool water into the subsoil <Col N="839"/>at Abbotstown. A number of reports have been carried out, but apart from the report on the storm damage to the roof to which I will later refer, I am unaware of an independent structural report carried out by an expert group of engineers. I appeal to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to ensure that is carried out before or concurrently with the commencement of the new authority. I will not take sides but what has happened at the National Aquatic Centre has tarnished the image of what should be a great facility for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The pool was obviously built in a hurry and there was much pressure placed on the builder and everyone concerned to have it ready for the Special Olympics. At the time, I am sure we all called on the Taoiseach, the Minister and CSID to finish the pool for the Special Olympics. On 26 March 2002, the Taoiseach admitted the National Aquatic Centre was a rushed job when he stated in the D&aacute;il that if all procedures had been followed to the letter of the law, we would not have been in a position to complete the swimming pool in time for the Special Olympics.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>Due to storm damage to the centre&rsquo;s roof, it was closed from January to May of 2005. Storm force winds ripped a 25 m section from the roof on New Year&rsquo;s Day causing more than &euro;1 million in damage to the roof structure. The independent report carried out on the damage by Kavanagh Mansfield and Partners consulting structural and civil engineers found that &ldquo;the damage to the competition hall roof was caused by the failure of elements within the roof assembly&rdquo;. It goes on to claim that this failure could not have occurred at wind speeds within normal design parameters for a building of this size in that location. Exceptional storm conditions need not have been present for the damage to occur. The roof failed due to lack of resistance to the wind suction forces exerted on the day of the storm. The forces did not exceed those that can be estimated for design purposes as possible to occur by reference to the normal design code. The report concluded that the roof decking did not comply with the normal design codes or, in that regard, with the building regulations. The engineers also stated that they were concerned about the safety of the roof.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
      <P>I suggest the new authority, on the direction of the Minister or its new chairman, should appoint Kavanagh Mansfield and Partners to carry out a structural report on the entire building. Only then can the new authority determine what repairs are necessary. It is important the report be carried out as soon as possible. If it is not, the new authority might become preoccupied with other problems in the National Aquatic Centre. For example, a legal case is ongoing and there will probably be others. There is a dispute about rental payments and who is responsible for what. If we had a proper engineer&rsquo;s report on the centre and the defects such as those found in most new <Col N="840"/>buildings at some stage, it would remove an argument from the equation. I suggest this way forward.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The British Olympic diving team had to cut short its training schedule at the National Aquatic Centre, NAC, because of a defective diving board. The defects in the building have been highlighted by a number of journalists, including RTE&rsquo;s chief reporter, Charlie Bird. The Government and CSID have pointed the finger at Dublin Waterworld for not maintaining the building properly. A snag list was drawn up before and after the opening of the NAC. It seems this process is incomplete and major structural defects in the building have never been corrected. The first task of the new authority is to correct the defects at the NAC and stop the blame game. As far as I know, Ireland has no diving programme or policy but the fact that the British Olympic team is using our facility is an endorsement of the centre. The building must be put in proper working order.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a group of people, including the OPW, CSID and the Department of Finance, to consult with Fingal County Council and undertake a study to determine a suitable mix of sporting, leisure and amenity use to create a vibrant and sustainable sports campus. The campus should be used by the public as well as elite athletes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the value of sport. Young people are in the Public Gallery this afternoon. I surveyed 1,400 primary schools recently and received feedback from the principals of those schools. This conclusively showed that physical education is not being taught in our schools and that is why, according to the Irish Heart Foundation, one in five children in the five to 12 age group are overweight or obese. We do not have sufficient facilities available in our schools, a point I have highlighted several times since I published the report. Only 23% of primary schools have a sports hall. Irish weather is unsuitable for taking children outside during most of the year. It is impossible for teachers to implement a physical education programme without facilities. While many facilities have been provided by the national lottery, I suggest giving preferential treatment to any school or local club that agrees to provide a hall on, or adjacent to, school grounds. In some cases, this would solve the problem.</P>
      <P>Of the schools that had sports halls only a small percentage had halls over 170 sq. m. This is the size of two badminton courts. This Bill is another part of the jigsaw in the development of infrastructure in sport. I see exciting possibilities for the new campus and, under the direction of people such as Con Haugh, it may make a major contribution to elite sports and creating a sporting culture. The Bill should not be seen as an end in itself. We must examine what is happening in our schools and communities. I look forward to addressing various issues on Committee Stage, <Col N="841"/>such as the structure and size of the proposed authority and the type of person who should be a member of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>We have waited a long time for this legislation to reach the House. Difficulties with Abbotstown had to be addressed before we debated this Bill. Ireland is a sports mad country and we have set standards that prioritise our national games. We must try to change this mind set and portray Ireland as a country with international ability at various disciplines. The Abbotstown campus is a first step as it will provide facilities for minority sports, giving them a prominence they have not enjoyed heretofore. The lack of public relations and financial backing are reasons these disciplines remain minority sports.</P>
      <P>During Question Time the Minister suggested at least 30 national organisations would be facilitated in Abbotstown. I hope the authority will examine creating a co-operative for minority sports, providing office staff and allowing these sports to develop. These sports have not been able to attract young people into the discipline. When children enter school they are asked if they want to play football, hurling, soccer or rugby. This reflects the mind set of the Irish sporting public, which encompasses everyone in Ireland to some extent.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Our boxers and athletes have tried to meet the maximum qualifying standards for the Olympic Games with the minimum number of competitors. As a small nation we do not have sufficient numbers to raise the standard in various disciplines to qualify for the Olympic Games. The advantage of London being the venue for the Olympic Games is a major factor. The costs accruing to the Irish Sports Council and the Olympic Council of Ireland will not be as high as for previous Olympic Games. The problem of relevant qualification pertaining to the different disciplines will raise its head and while this occasion should allow for the largest national team to be sent to London I wonder what the rewards will be when it comes to success. Is success measured by the country&rsquo;s attendance and participation or by the winning of medals?</P>
      <P>The proposal is to look after the elite sportspeople through funding of the sporting bodies but sports at school level must be encouraged. This facility is to be welcomed. My predecessor as spokesperson, Deputy O&rsquo;Shea, always supported the establishment of a centre of excellence. If this centre is regarded as solely provided for the elite athletes, we will not reap the significant and beneficial rewards. Young people must be attracted to sport. Thirty national sports will be facilitated as detailed by the Minister in his contribution. I hope that when Abbotstown is up and running, it will provide a central focus for many sporting groups which will encourage a diversification from a more narrow mindset which con<Col N="842"/>centrates on the national sports and rugby and soccer.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the role of sports in developing a healthy society. The proposed centre at Abbotstown will be a means of preventing anti-social behaviour among the young which is widespread in every village, town and city. Senior citizens are suffering as a result of anti-social behaviour and sport and recreation is the one way to combat it. If youngsters can be shown that sport and recreation are alternatives to anti-social behaviour it would create a far healthier society. Senior citizens could enjoy living in their own area and enjoy watching and supporting local youngsters playing sports on the playing fields. This would help eliminate the major social problem of anti-social behaviour which afflicts every village and town.</P>
      <P>Recently the Community Games was the subject of a question to the Minister. Given the amount of land included in the proposed development, I ask the Minister to consider whether a mechanism is available to allow for the Community Games to be part and parcel of the overall structure. The Community Games includes a variety of activities such as drama, art and the many aspects of sport. It would be a natural progression for them to attach themselves to a particular sport or discipline and standards would rise as a result. If standards do not improve there could be disappointment in ten or 12 years&rsquo; time when we may not attain the success we hoped for. If the enthusiasm and energy of the sporting associations does not reap the rewards in an improvement in performance in the Olympic Games, this disappointment may create problems in the aim of a better society being achieved through the provision of sporting and recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>The national lottery has been a means of providing funding for sporting facilities in towns and villages. There has been a decrease in the number of people willing to help as volunteers and this may be due to longer commuting times. Participation in sporting activities has decreased as a result. I ask the Minister to facilitate schools and those living in the extensive catchment area of Abbotstown. He is allowing for private entrepreneurs to provide facilities. I hope he will allow young people to come to the centre at Abbotstown where they can see the elite athletes.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider providing national lottery funding to the various clubs which are encountering difficulties because of the decrease in the numbers of volunteers, in particular clubs in less well-off areas, to hire mentors or coaches. The facilities may be in place but the national lottery funding may be a means of providing funding at local level to pay for the necessary training of youngsters. A young person who is involved in any sport or recreation will not have anti-social behaviour problems. In recent months the newspapers highlighted occasions on which a person with a sporting background was in trouble with the law because it is an exceptional <Col N="843"/>occurrence. Those with no background in sport or other recreation, such as drama, are reported in the newspapers every day of the week as having problems.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I cannot understand section 38, which provides: &ldquo;The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister [for Arts, Sport and Tourism] shall have, and be deemed always to have had, power to hold and transfer shares in the Company and the establishment of the Company shall be, and be deemed always to have been, as valid and effectual as if they had that power at the time of its establishment.&rdquo; I would like the Minister to explain that? The Labour Party has raised it several times in the past on similar Bills but has not received an answer. We have argued on the indemnity deal on some aspects of Bills, and this was strongly contested by the Taoiseach. He claimed that as a statutory corporation the Minster had a general contractual capacity. We wonder if he is now getting different advice and whether we will be able to discuss that matter. I ask the Minister to clear up the matter when he sums up on Second Stage.</P>
      <P Just="Left">
        
        Like the Minister and Deputy Deenihan, I congratulate and thank Mr. Con Haugh, who has always been available to Opposition spokespersons who wanted to speak to him. With his staff he has done much work on this facility.</P>
      <P Just="Left">If we are to achieve international success at the Olympic Games we must broaden the range of sports followed by the Irish sporting public to include Olympic disciplines. Given that Abbotstown will facilitate 30 different disciplines, people may value sports they did not previously recognise. I was at a meeting of the Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs when the Young D&aacute;il officials visited. One of the young people said he was not interested in soccer or football but liked to kick a ball around. Some of the disciplines to be newly available at Abbotstown may be of interest and benefit to that young person who feels that GAA, soccer and rugby are too competitive for his physical well-being or attributes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. We will discuss it further on Committee Stage when some of the matters raised here will be discussed by way of amendments or by the Minister clarifying some of the aspects of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>With the Chairman&rsquo;s permission I would like to share my time with Deputies Crowe and Finian McGrath, in that order.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back. I agree with the statements by Deputies Deenihan and Wall. I will not explore the minutiae of the National Aquatic Centre or the issues Deputy Deenihan raised. Suffice to say that the new sports campus development authority will have its work cut out on that. As the Minister has opened the debate to include wider sports issues, I will not say much on the Bill. Given the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the <Col N="844"/>Abbotstown facility, it is in the wrong location. Ideally it should serve the needs of the Blanchardstown area. Although one could argue that it is within a ten or 15 minute walk of the railway line to Sligo, most of the city and country will reach Abbotstown via the M50, which, as the authorities have acknowledged, will still be congested after the widening works are completed. This is despite the cost overrun from &euro;300 million to &euro;800 million, which the Taoiseach said in this House could run as high as &euro;1 billion. In the absence of a cross-city metro system, a network of Luas lines or investment in the Dublin Bus network it is difficult to see how the country will benefit from this national facility. This facility is primarily for elite athletes and then for the local community. I have concerns on the commercialism of the final entity versus its ability to be available cheaply to the local community.</P>
      <P>Assuming the project will go ahead at this location, I am concerned about the residential aspect. Will this mean more housing beside Abbotstown or housing for the people using the centre, an elite athletes&rsquo; village? I support the latter but I do not support an excuse to raise revenue for the local authority or the Government by building more houses. Given the large population increase in Blanchardstown, which used to be part of my electoral standing area over the years, this is not the right location.</P>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged that there are growing concerns in Ireland and internationally about low levels of physical activity, particularly among young people. Obesity has become a critical public health concern. Investment in sport can yield a tangible return in improved fitness and health for the individual with a consequent reduction in demand for health services. This is why I have called for increased sports funding. Even the dogs in the street or, I should say, the dogs at the track know the problem lies with funding. The Minister has acknowledged in previous replies that 37% of sports funding goes to dogs and horses. I will discuss that in more detail later.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The most important area is outside the remit of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. There is a serious deficit in schools. As Deputy Deenihan said, people must get involved at an early age and the schools are the appropriate forum. Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s survey pointed out that schools suffer from a deficit of sport equipment, as have surveys by the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI. Given that schools are lucky to have the most basic PE hall, teachers view the PE curriculum as a joke, particularly the <Col N="845"/>water safety aspect. I have heard that schools may practice water safety using a bench, without ever touching a pool. That is the biggest joke of all.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder we go on to under-perform on the world stage, as witnessed by our poor medal haul in successive Olympic Games. In terms of Olympic achievements, Ireland continues to lag behind developed countries with a similar population as well as those with fewer resources. This is not the fault of the athletes who most recently went to Athens, did their best on the day and did Ireland proud. Given the lack of joined-up thinking between Departments such as Education and Science, Arts, Sport and Tourism, and Health and Children our rare successes have been achieved in spite of rather than because of a strategy. Otherwise, it would not be taking nigh on 50 years to honour Ronnie Delaney, for example.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Following on from the Olympic Games there was the same talk from the Taoiseach and the Minister about commitment to developing sport. At the same time schools are suffering from serious under-investment in physical education facilities. For four successive years the paltry grant of &euro;600 to &euro;1,200 for sports equipment in schools has been withheld. The Taoiseach has promised additional funding for sport. It is as well that schools should be targeted for a start, since survey after survey has shown that if children get involved in sport they are much more likely to continue this into adulthood. Again, I will call on the Department of Education and Science &mdash; not the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, he will be glad to hear &mdash; to increase this grant and to target funding into schools building projects. This might include lottery grants for individual primary and secondary schools or for projects involving links with local sports clubs. Sharing and clustering facilities in line with the integrated public partnership approach proposed by the Green Party would mean facilities could be open all day and run cost effectively for the benefit of the community. Schools in rural and urban areas could also benefit in terms of how extensions to existing facilities might operate. There are issues involved as regards security and management, but these could be dealt with later on.</P>
      <P>Although there has been preliminary work on an audit of sports facilities which was promised in An Agreed Programme for Government, we are still waiting for it. We will not have such a countrywide audit by the time of the next general election, so we will not know who is taking part among the various social, economic and demographic groups. We do not have the data to allow for a more precise type of investment where it is most needed.</P>
      <P>The message to the Minister is to work from the bottom up. We need to look at a beauty facility such as the Abbotstown sports campus, but we also need to look at long-term funding so that carded athletes can develop their abilities <Col N="846"/>with reasonable financial security. We need to be able to identify top performers at an earlier age. That means the countrywide roll-out of local sports partnerships and development through the schools system. The high performance strategy identified the need to establish clear pathways to the top, according to the Irish Sports Council. Those support structures will not be available unless there is investment in the schools system. The Department of Education and Science should take over that aspect of sport for young people or the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism should be made totally responsible for the provision of facilities in schools. A gap there needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I mentioned earlier that Government funding had gone to the dogs. It certainly has, with some 37% of the Department&rsquo;s sport funding going to the horse and greyhound industries. In response to my raising the issue before, the Minister made a few jokes, which was fair enough. However, he made no comment on the &euro;16 million that Coolmore Stud, for example, was able to spend on a horse which will reap it a good deal of money in the long-term. He did not mention, either, that the horse and greyhound industries are based on gambling and to a lesser extent, alcohol. These are pursuits I do not intend to criticise in their own right, but they are the wrong areas to fund while we are talking about obesity and trying to get people involved in sports. Perhaps the horse and greyhound funding, after 2008, should be abolished and real investment could be put into people instead. We are looking towards the 2012 Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games where, as the Minister has said, there are opportunities to promote Ireland as a high technology centre. We will not have high-tech well-developed athletes competing in that, however, or young people reaching their sporting potential, because they will not have had the funding. If one does not have the proper play areas and facilities one cannot get involved in sports. We have seen the romantic dream in a particular television programme where an individual goes to Mongolia or Brazil on behalf of someone who is working here &mdash; I cannot recall the name of the programme. One sees the children out in the dirt tracks kicking ball. There are very few sports in which a ball can just be kicked around and people develop into top class athletes. Most of them need facilities. In this context, if the Minister will not reduce the funding for the horse and greyhound industries, can he at least, in conjunction with his colleagues in the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, look at increasing funding for sport and people? That means starting from the bottom and providing facilities that people need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>In his reply to a priority question last week from my colleague, Deputy Ferris, the Minister stated that in regard to the possible difficulties affecting the development of Lansdowne <Col N="847"/>Road there was no &ldquo;plan B&rdquo; at the present time. However, if the redevelopment runs into difficulties as has been widely predicted, an alternative might be needed. The question is, therefore, whether this Bill is laying the ground for such an alternative. If that is the case, surely the Government ought to be more honest about it. I say that because of the widespread belief that even though the Minister and other supporters of the original proposal to build a national stadium, including the Taoiseach, were overruled by the PD minority in Government in 2004, they have not entirely given up on the idea. Any impediment placed in the way of the re-development of Lansdowne will be seized on as an opportunity to proceed with a full-scale stadium capable of hosting international soccer and rugby internationals at Abbotstown.</P>
      <P>The question must be posed as to whether the Government has any real commitment to the Lansdowne project. I say this on the basis of the likely foreseen difficulties in securing planning permission and the Minister&rsquo;s stated position on Lansdowne in recent years. In February 2003, when the proposal to build a national stadium at Abbotstown or another site was still a live option, the Minister told the House that he saw the provision of a 65,000-capacity stadium as essential to meet the future requirements of international fixtures in soccer and rugby, and the optimum if the project was to be financially viable. Last week he stated that the redeveloped Lansdowne Road venue would have a seating capacity of 50,000. Does he believe this is a viable figure and if so, what has happened to change his mind in the interval?</P>

	<P>Croke Park has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will this relatively modest capacity be another reason an alternative facility based at Abbotstown is required. My party has no ideological objections to the development of such a facility. We certainly support the development of a state of the art sports facility to cater for other sports. However, we believe that more transparency is required, particularly in regard to precisely what is being proposed for the Abbotstown site.</P>
      <P>The text of the Bill does not make the position clear, although the reference in section 7 to professional and amateur sports people clearly allows for scope for the development of a stadium as originally envisaged. Section 8 provides for the involvement of non-statutory bodies that would facilitate such a proposal. In this regard, perhaps the Minister might indicate his thoughts on the Community Games, which many of us support each year, and the whole question of a permanent home for them. I am told they are to be held at Mosney in 2010. As part of this proposal, the Minister might look at the Community Games, as one of the organisations involved with so many <Col N="848"/>young people from different backgrounds, keeping them out of trouble and so on. Anyone who goes to Santry or Mosney every year will see many of those young people representing their communities. In many cases it is their first step on the ladder, and some of them have gone on to gain international recognition and support elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It will be interesting to observe what moves follow the likely passing of this Bill and what takes place during the planning process for the re-development of the Lansdowne stadium. I am certain the GAA, at least, will watch closely, as I am aware of a growing feeling among members that they are not being told the full story about the decision to allow international rugby and soccer fixtures in Croke Park during the redevelopment of the IRFU stadium. A number of GAA members who originally supported the opening up of Croke Park to international rugby and soccer including, I am reliably informed, full-time officials, have changed their mind because they believe they have been treated as pawns in a wider game that includes the possible revival of the national stadium proposal.</P>
      <P>It is also feared that the short-term contract may need to be extended if the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium runs into difficulties, pending completion of an alternative site, which would obviously take a number of years. In this scenario, the GAA would, once again, be subject to considerable pressure from several quarters to make another magnanimous gesture. Many people feel that such a gesture would not only be at the possible expense of GAA sports but would be used as a fig leaf to cover the failures of others, including the State.</P>
      <P>I also strongly believe that while a modern national facility to cater for sports such as athletics and swimming is necessary, priority should be given to the provision of modern facilities at local and regional level. There is no point in having an athletics track capable of hosting international events in Dublin if talented young runners around the country do not have access to adequate training facilities within a reasonable distance of their homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the very important debate on the National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill. When we debate this legislation, it is important we touch on sport in general because, frequently, we do not sufficiently value sport&rsquo;s contribution to society, particularly the immediate effect on people who participate in sport. The benefits of participating in sport encompass health, fitness and personal development for young people and adults. If someone participates in sport from a young age, it can gave him or her a positive sense of the competitive side of life, which will benefit him or her in the long term. This is why this debate is so important.</P><Col N="849"/>
      <P>Before we address the details of the legislation, we should highlight and set down our priorities as a society. While I accept that sport is important, other issues must come first. It is amazing and rather odd that we can build a magnificent stadium at Croke Park with excellent facilities that are far in advance of those in other international stadia but we cannot solve some of our social problems, particularly those pertaining to health. Yesterday, we heard about the 450 people left on trolleys in accident and emergency departments in hospitals. It is amazing that we can combine our talents and intelligence to build a massive stadium yet we have been unable to resolve the accident and emergency problem over the last number of years. Sport is, therefore, linked to health and poverty.</P>
      <P>However, there is no contradiction between my previous comments and my belief in the importance of sport. We must prioritise certain areas. Issues such as the crisis in accident and emergency departments, people with disabilities and people living in poverty must be top of the social and political agenda. It is only then that we can get on with developing other issues.</P>
      <P>Sport for children is extremely important. There has been a decline in children&rsquo;s participation in sport, particularly in recent years. We now live in the computer age and children spend hours in front of computers, particularly after they come home from school, and do not take part in activities in which they would have participated 20 or 30 years ago, such as playing football or other games. We must connect this issue with the issue of health.</P>
      <P>I commend teachers, particularly primary school teachers who are directly involved in coaching and teaching physical education. Not only do they make a significant contribution to the health of young children, they are also facilitating the release of energy and aggression. Students from schools with a strong involvement in sport, particularly those located in disadvantaged areas, are less likely to become involved in crime and other anti-social behaviour. If one examines the lives of many children who get into trouble with the law in some communities, the sad reality is that they are not involved in sport. There are many creative people working in the primary education sector and many excellent physical education teachers in secondary education. When we plan the curriculum, we should design sports to suit the needs of children. Not all children are good at soccer, rugby or Gaelic football so a wider range of sports should be made available to ensure these children are catered for.</P>
      <P>It is important to value the contribution sport has made, particularly over the last ten years, to the personal development and inclusion of people with disabilities. From my work with families of people with disabilities, particularly those with physical disabilities, I know sport has had a major impact on them. The contributions they have <Col N="850"/>made and their inclusion in society must be supported. There should be no holding back when it comes to funding sporting projects, particularly for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Irish soccer team and its new manager, Steve Staunton. Before his appointment, many cynics queried his suitability for the role because of his lack of experience. I was one of the people who stood by and supported him, particularly with regard to the question of his experience. I also wish the Irish rugby team well in Saturday&rsquo;s match against Scotland. When we examine sport in more detail, we can see that it has created role models for both children and adults. People like Padraig Harrington and Damien Duff have a major contribution to make towards the formation of progressive and sensitive people.</P>
      <P>However, we must also support our own clubs. I am saddened when people support clubs in other countries at the expense of their local clubs. As a supporter of Shelbourne Football Club, which is based in Tolka Park, I commend the club for the magnificent work it carries out in the general area. In the wake of the recent riots in O&rsquo;Connell Street, residents in the Richmond Road area are concerned about potential trouble at the next match between Shelbourne and Linfield. I have informed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of my concerns. Windows in houses on Richmond were smashed following a match between Shelbourne and Glentoran. I appeal to the Minister to wake up with regard to this issue because we do not want to see trouble at one of our football matches.</P>
      <P>We should also commend the magnificent work carried out by Cumann na mBunscol over the years in our primary schools. It has contributed significantly to the development of children&rsquo;s sport and health and fitness issues. We must also commend the clubs in our constituencies which have made a major contribution to sports. I am thinking in particular of clubs in my constituency such as Craobh Chiar&aacute;in GAA Club in Donnycarney, St. Vincent&rsquo;s GAA Club in Marino, Clontarf GAA Club, Whitehall Colmcille and the Parnell Gaelic Football Club. I urge the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to fund and support all these clubs in the interests of the local community because they play a very valuable role.</P>
      <P>A few Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas football team are present. I commend Deputy Deenihan on the magnificent work he has carried out for charities through our football team.</P>

      <P>When one examines the details of this legislation, one can see that the Government has approved the creation of the national sports campus development authority to oversee the planning and development of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown in Dublin 15. The Bill&rsquo;s primary purpose is to provide the statutory basis for this authority, which I welcome. Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill provide for the making of an order by the Minister to set a date for the establishment of the authority, which will be known as the national sports campus development authority and which will have, with the approval of the Minister and the consent of the Minister for Finance, the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land and other property. I hope that if someone comes up with a sensible idea which will benefit sport and communities in Ireland, the Minister for Finance will not stand in the way.</P>
      <P>Section 7 describes the authority&rsquo;s functions. The primary functions of the authority are to develop a sports campus on the site in Abbotstown; furnish, equip, manage, operate and maintain it; and encourage and promote its use by professional and amateur sportspeople and members of the public. Section 7 is important because it deals with the professional and amateur aspects, and there is a role for both. We have an extra onus to ensure those involved directly in amateur sport get priority under the plan.</P>
      <P>A development plan for the campus must be submitted for approval by the Minister and the Government before the commencement of each phase. Details of the phases must also be submitted for approval. I welcome some of the progressive developments that have taken place in the FAI under the leadership of John Delaney. There is a sense of excitement and expectation. It is a new management team who have massive knowledge and experience. The planning application has been lodged for the new stadium and an agreement has been reached on Croke Park, which is a brave and popular decision. In the meantime, we are preparing for the Euro 2008 qualifiers, which will give another boost to the country and create positive energy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s approval for the sports campus. While these are the big events, as Members we must ensure the local events get priority. I urge people to support their local clubs because these are the backbone of the national bodies. These clubs bring the children up through <Col N="852"/>the system and make a contribution in their local communities. As I said earlier, clubs like St. Vincent&rsquo;s in Marino, Craobh Chiar&aacute;in in Donnycarney, Clontarf GAA club, Whitehall Colmcille and Parnell GAA club have made a massive contribution to the community spirit in my constituency.</P>
      <P>Section 24 allows the Minister to give general policy directions to the authority. As the Minister is elected by the people, it is an important aspect. While it is right to put an emphasis on amateur sport and health and fitness, access to sport for people with disabilities should also be taken into account. Social inclusion means making it possible for people with disabilities to become involved in sport in their communities. We saw an example of this during the Special Olympics where people got involved and a buzz was created around the activities, particularly the event in Croke Park. I was there with my family and many parents and friends of people with disabilities, and the way in which the children were directly involved played a major part in involving them in the community spirit. I urge the Minister to deal with this issue in a positive and constructive way.</P>
      <P>The arts are also important for society. They are something that people may not take seriously, but they are important for children. While there may be children in the system who are not especially interested in sport, they may be interested in music and the arts. There should be no elitism in the development of this area.</P>
      <P>Section 29 provides that the authority or a subsidiary may borrow with the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 30 provides that the authority may, for the purposes of providing access, acquire by agreement or, in accordance with Schedule 2, compulsorily, any land adjoining the Abbotstown site or any interest in or right over such land. Schedule 2 details the provisions relating to the compulsory acquisition of the land referred to in section 30, including that such acquisition must be authorised by an order made by the Minister. This is an important aspect. When dealing with planning issues, we must ensure that local people are directly involved and considered in a positive manner.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and commend him on bringing this important legislation before the House. Sport is not just about the cream of society but about everyone. Everyone should get involved in sport and in their local club. They should choose the sport they like and make a contribution to the club, society and the country.</P>

	<P>It is a pleasure to speak on the Bill and to congratulate the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, and his officials, especially Mr. Con Haugh, on all the achievements that have been made over recent years in sport in Ireland, particularly the very positive and benign influence of the Government in the major developments that are taking place.</P>
      <P>Listening to some of my colleagues on the opposite side, I wonder on what planet they live. Deputy Crowe should realise that it is not possible to have an Olympic swimming pool in every village. He appeared to think it was. He also appeared to want running tracks at every crossroads, which is not the way life is. Deputy Gogarty complained about the amount of money allocated by the Department to horse and greyhound racing. Obviously he is not a fan of either sport, because anyone who goes to either a race meeting or a dog track and witnesses the economic and sporting activity which takes place hand in glove will realise the advantage this is, not just to the economy but to the social fabric of the country, especially rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Section 26 of the Bill is a standard provision requiring the authority to provide itself with a seal. Perhaps that would be the Green Party&rsquo;s best contribution to the Bill. Deputy Sargent has a whole sanctuary of them at Garretstown.</P>

	<P>It is a pleasure to speak on the Bill, even though my time will be divided between this afternoon and the next day. I reiterate my compliments to the Minister and his staff.</P>
      <P>Sport in Ireland has come on in leaps and bounds over recent years. The number of women participating in sport, which I will deal with in the other part of my contribution, is growing at a phenomenal rate. One only has to look at ladies&rsquo; football under the auspices of the FAI and camogie and ladies&rsquo; football under the auspices of the GAA to see the amount of participation that is taking place in every parish throughout the country. Participation is what sport is about. It is not about sitting with one&rsquo;s feet up, however enjoyable it may be, looking at Sky Sports or whatever.</P>
      <P>While it is important to the economics of sport, we should not get carried away with that end of sport which I have often referred to as the show business side. While a positive advantage may accrue from that side of sport, the reality is what the Minister&rsquo;s approach is all about. He is trying to provide the facilities so that ordinary men, women and children can participate fully in the healthy activity of sport and if by chance they want to move into an elite sport, this facility will be available to as many people as can avail of the opportunity. We tend to get carried away by the show business aspect of sport and we tend to think it is the reality. It is a tiny percentage of the numbers participating in sport. It bears little <Col N="854"/>reality to the sport to which I refer in which we all participate at some stage and, I hope, for lengthy periods in our lives. I hope increasing numbers of young people will become involved in that end of sport.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>Under section 15 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for the establishment of a Garda reserve, the powers and duties of reserve members may be determined by the Garda Commissioner. The Garda Commissioner, in a comprehensive submission to me on the Garda reserve, has proposed that the powers of reserve members will be confined to the enforcement of certain aspects of the following Acts: under the Road Traffic Acts &mdash; demanding driving licences and insurance details, enforcing the wearing of seat belts etc; under the Public Order Act &mdash; dealing with the offences of intoxication, threatening behaviour, disorderly conduct and failure to comply with the direction of a member of the Garda <Col N="855"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act &mdash; dealing with the offences of theft and burglary. Reserve members would also be given the power of arrest under the Criminal Law Act 1997, which provides powers of arrest for both members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilians.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals make clear that reserve members will receive more than 120 hours initial training, which is up to the best international standard, including training on the exercise by reserve members of their powers, which are limited; they will be vetted to the same extent as full-time garda&iacute; as regards security and character &mdash; there is no danger of infiltration by subversives or criminals of the reserve force or the force in general; they will have the same educational standards as recruits to the full-time force; they will only patrol in the presence and under the supervision of full-time members; they will only serve in uniform and will not drive official vehicles or carry firearms; they will be subject to a full disciplinary code; and they will not be deployed to carry out duties in their own immediate neighbourhoods.</P>
        <P>I have said that I am extremely impressed with the comprehensive nature of the proposals for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reserve made to me by the Garda Commissioner. The proposals envisage a thoroughly trained reserve with carefully selected powers and duties, working under the supervision of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have asked each of the Garda representative associations to meet me to discuss the proposals before I proceed to draw up the necessary regulations for Government approval. I am glad to say the associations have agreed to this and the meetings are scheduled to take place over the next two weeks. I have also said that I will present the regulations in draft form to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for consideration.</P>
        <P>The Garda reserve will be a valuable additional support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It will enhance the force&rsquo;s capacity to respond to emerging policing challenges and will reinforce its links with local communities. At the same time, the strength of the force is being massively increased from 12,000 to 14,000 members and the Garda budget is also at an all time high. This year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;1.29 billion represents an increase of 13% on the allocation for 2005. It includes provision of over &euro;83.5 million for overtime, an increase of &euro;23 million on last year&rsquo;s allocation, which will yield over 2.7 million hours of Garda overtime for frontline policing throughout the State. Millions of euro are being spent on upgrading Garda stations throughout the country and the roll out of a new state-of-the-art Garda digital radio system will commence this year.</P>
        <P>This huge increase in the strength and resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supplemented by the additional resource of a well trained <Col N="856"/>reserve with carefully selected powers and duties, will significantly increase the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat crime and disorder, and provide the public with the security and safety it rightly demands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make it clear that it has been Fine Gael policy for a long time to establish a Garda reserve as support and back-up for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but my concern is that the ham-fisted approach of the Minister in the introduction of a Garda reserve may have damaged the successful implementation of the scheme. He has totally failed to engage the principal stakeholders &mdash; that is, those on the frontline, the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &mdash; in the development of the proposals.</P>
        <P>I met the presidents, vice presidents and general secretaries of both the main organisations, the Garda Representative Association and Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors early last week and made it clear to them that I was in favour of the idea but that I wanted to know their concerns. Their main concern, to which the Minister must respond, was the lack of prior consultation. They were very aggrieved that there had been no consultation whatsoever with them on the development of these proposals, what would be successfully operational and what would be the main obstacles. After all, they are on the frontline and they believed they should have had an input.</P>
        <P>They also felt there was a serious breach of trust on the part of the Minister in that they understood from discussions with him at the time of the introduction of the Bill that this was purely an enabling measure and that it would not be introduced in the lifetime of this Government or the next one, at least while Deputy McDowell was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They were absolutely clear on that and felt betrayed by what had happened in the meantime.</P>
        <P>The third issue they raised was the powers of any such force and, as the Minister knows, I am in agreement with them in this regard. They were very concerned that while on duty, members of such a force would have full powers of arrest, some of which the Minister detailed. I have major concerns that a volunteer reserve force would have powers beyond the powers of arrest available to any citizen. My approach would be that they would operate totally under the supervision and direction of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Other areas, such as vetting, discipline etc. can be discussed but these are three principal issues arising from those meetings. What is the Minister&rsquo;s reaction to my comments and, in particular, to those three major issues which arose in my discussions with the representatives of the GRA and the AGSI?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the acknowledgement by Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe that his party has sol<Col N="857"/>idly and fully supported the establishment of a Garda reserve and that it promised it to the electorate on a number of occasions. I note he has not, in any way, resiled from that.</P>
        <P>On the question of consultation, as the Deputy well knows, the Bill was crafted on the supposition that the initiative and proposals for a reserve would come from the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it would not be a question of the Minister deciding on a reserve and starting to consult the Garda associations. That is written into law. The strange thing is that I began to detect opposition to the process of internal consultation in which the Commissioner engaged before he made any proposals to me about the nature and functions of a reserve. I read in the newspapers about two days&rsquo; training etc. at a time when I had received nothing from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the same subject. From the moment I received the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals, I indicated that I would maintain an open door policy with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I pre-empted no one in this respect. I re-emphasise to the Deputy that I will talk to anybody at any time on this subject.</P>
        <P>The second issue the Deputy raised was that when the heads of the original Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill were published, I had a meeting with members of the GRA and AGSI and they had considerable problems with a number of the provisions in the Bill. For instance, at that time they indicated they would advise their members not to have anything to do with the Garda Ombudsman Commission&rsquo;s inquiries and that they envisaged members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not conduct inquiries at the behest of that commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">They had other very strong objections to, for instance, the obligation to fully account for the manner in which they carried out their duties. They expressed very strong constitutional reasons why they thought what was being proposed in the heads of the Bill was incorrect. In the course of that conversation I said to them that I did not envisage introducing the Garda reserve in the course of the lifetime of this Government. The reason I did so was because on the publication of the Garda Bill there was no indication at that time of the Government&rsquo;s agreement to expand the force to 14,000 because of the embargo that was in place. I had made a solemn commitment in public that I would never use the reserve as a substitute for proper recruitment and staffing for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I said that to them at the time and they know that. If they have a careful minute of what was said, I told them that was the reason, that I was not in a position at that time to deliver the extra strength to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of the freeze on Government recruitment and, therefore, at that stage I did not envisage being in a position during the lifetime of the Government to bring forward the proposals for a reserve.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make this point in regard to power. I am in the process of consultation. The Commissioner has made proposals to me. Like the Deputy I will be very careful to ensure the reserve&rsquo;s powers are commensurate with its training and capacity. I will not budge from that because I, just as much as everybody else in this House, am committed to the success of a reserve. I hope the Deputy is not thinking of back-pedalling from it on the basis of its powers because it is for us in this House to decide. I will be putting the regulations for the reserve before this House. It is for us in this House to decide those issues but it is not a good reason for not going ahead with the force in principle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill that went through the D&aacute;il contained one section dealing with the volunteer reserve force consisting of 15 or 16 lines. It was very sparse in detail. On various Stages I queried the lack of detail on protections, safeguards and training and asked for some specific details but very few specifics were forthcoming. This is part of the problem when one is introducing something as major as another police force. The Minister has referred to building up the reserve force to 4,000 members. This will have major repercussions. The reassurances that were needed at the time were not forthcoming and have not been given since, even though the Minister has gone down the road some distance towards opening the debate, having consultation and so on. The fear of the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors arises from the Mini<Col N="859"/>ster&rsquo;s past record in regard to delivery of services to the Garda.</P>

	<P>Will Deputy Costello formulate a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If it will take over six years to get 2,000 full-time trained garda&iacute; in place but 900 reserve garda&iacute; will be in place by September of this year it is no wonder the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na considers this a yellow pack reserve force. Garda&iacute; have complained they have only one pair of summer trousers, one pair of winter trousers, and that they have to provide their own torch batteries, use their own mobiles and only have analogue telecommunications. They are totally under-resourced but the Minister is ploughing ahead with this force.</P>
        <P>Why should they not expect the worst in this respect considering that no prior consultation has taken place with the force? Consultation is only now about to commence. The Garda has organised a series of meetings around the country. Senator Maurice Hayes has given his implementation report on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which does not include any reference to the implementation of the Garda reserve. Could we not provide the 2,000 extra garda&iacute; to give reassurance to the Garda that it will not be babysitting an inadequately trained reserve force that is imposed on it and that the major components of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill will be up and running? In the meantime we can have a process of consultation with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, and the pilot scheme can be put in place so we can all see where we are going on this important issue. I agree with the Minister that we have all supported this in principle but we need to put the nuts and bolts of it together properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be brief. We are well over time on this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I favour a consensus approach. That is what I am doing. My door is open. I am bringing the regulations to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. It is open to the members of that committee to bring in the representative associations and to discuss any principled difficulties they may have with them. I met with the AGSI and told it that until I had a proposal from the Commissioner I could not discuss with it rumours that I had read in newspapers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask every Member of this House to look at today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> where there is an excellent article setting out some of the realities of a reserve force and how it operates in a neighbouring jurisdiction. It refers to the attitude of full-time police officers in that jurisdiction and their federation to such a reserve force. Anybody who reads the article by Paul Kelly in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish <Col N="860"/>Examiner</i> will come away with a strong conviction that it is a good idea.</P>
        <P>In addition to the process of consultation we had in the course of the debate where I indicated the regulatory framework was business for another day, members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights went to the United Kingdom and saw at first hand the special constabulary that operates there and came back with an entirely favourable view of all of that. I could not discuss proposals I had not received. As soon as I did receive them I invited the associations to discuss them with me. They have used intemperate language describing the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposal as &ldquo;crazy and dangerous&rdquo;. I reject that language out of hand. Deputy Costello suggested the Garda had used the term yellow pack but in fairness to the associations the only time this term has been used is in this House, not by the Garda. I do not propose to get into a confrontational mode.</P>

	<P>I have not breached trust with anybody. As a Minister, my trust is to implement the law as laid down by this House, as backed by all the Members of this House. It is true that when the recruitment of 2,000 extra garda&iacute; was held back by the public service embargo I made it clear to the associations that I would not use the reserve force as a substitute for the expansion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I am sticking to that proposition.</P>

	<P>The Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s proposal is for a force of 4,000 with initial pilot projects in a number of areas.

        <Quest>the number of garda&iacute; and other security personnel provided for the two refuelling stops by the US presidential aircraft at Shannon Airport recently; the cost of these security arrangements; the number of garda&iacute; deployed at the Love Ulster rally in Dublin on 25 February 2006; the cost of those security arrangements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[9961/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is standard practice for visiting Heads of State and other similar VIPs to make the Government, via the Department of Foreign Affairs, aware of any intention to visit or pass through the State so that any necessary security arrangements may be put in place to ensure an incident-free event from the perspec<Col N="862"/>tives of both the visiting VIP and the local communities. In the case of two stopovers by US President Bush at Shannon Airport on 1 and 5 March last, this standard practice was fully adhered to. In response, the Garda authorities put in place security arrangements at Shannon Airport commensurate with the risk associated with the profile and standing of a President of the United States of America. These arrangements included the deployment of Garda personnel supported by the Defence Forces acting as an aid to the civil power.</P>
        <P>It is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to detail the specific security arrangements in place at Shannon, including the number of Garda personnel involved. In this regard, I hope that the Deputy will appreciate that revealing such information about past security arrangements would be manifestly detrimental to the very purpose of invoking such arrangements in the future.</P>
        <P>I have previously informed this House that the Garda authorities deployed 281 members to police the Love Ulster parade on 25 February, with an additional 67 member detachment of the public order unit held discreetly in reserve. As the appalling scenes of rioting developed, a further 138 members arrived to assist, including a 47-strong additional group of members drawn from the public order unit. Although for sound security reasons I am not in a position to detail the precise number of garda&iacute; deployed at Shannon, I can say, perhaps to the Deputy&rsquo;s disappointment, that numbers did not exceed those initially deployed at the rally in Dublin city centre, contrary to some media reports. There were fewer people at Shannon for the Bush visits than were initially deployed for the Love Ulster rally in O&rsquo;Connell Street.</P>
        <P>I am not in a position to provide details of the costs incurred by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of the Love Ulster rally or the Shannon stopovers, as this information is still being collated by Garda management and is not yet available. I wish, however, to comment upon the attempted juxtaposition of policing strengths at the Love Ulster rally and the security arrangements at Shannon Airport. We are dealing with two entirely separate and distinct kinds of Garda operation. The two events were entirely separate in nature and, consequently, demanded an entirely separate response for which comparisons are invalid, except to say that, contrary to what was printed in newspapers, the number of garda&iacute; deployed for President Bush&rsquo;s visits to Shannon was smaller than the number initially deployed to police the Love Ulster rally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not given many details, citing security reasons. I have nothing to go on other than the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that we cannot compare the demonstrations. Only nine people stood in the rain in the middle of the night to demonstrate at Shannon Airport. I hope the <Col N="863"/>Minister accepts that many people will be annoyed to discover that a major security operation was mounted in Shannon to protect one man, albeit the President of the United States and commander-in-chief of US forces in Iraq, while on the other hand there were insufficient garda&iacute; on the streets of Dublin to protect the citizens of the city from a rampaging mob who engaged in wanton violence and caused millions of euro worth of damage to business. Does this not demonstrate that the Minister&rsquo;s priorities are skewed?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister tell the House the basis on which he mounted the security operation in Shannon? Did he have prior information that there would be trouble? There was no inkling of it on the Internet. Will the Minister explain how neither he nor the Garda had any inkling of potential violence in Dublin when the Internet was alive with traffic that indicated there would be trouble? The Minister has surveillance of the Internet but this did not require much effort. One need only have looked at the various sites and blogs. Deputy Costello indicated that there could be violence when he spoke in the House. How could the Minister not have a clue what would happen in Dublin when he is the Minister who knows what he knows?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not decide the security arrangements at any event. Such decisions are for the operational judgment of garda&iacute; under the Commissioner. I am not consulted in advance and have no input into Garda security arrangements. I do not micro-manage them. The strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at either event or at any other is not dictated by me so my priorities are not skewed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the Deputy said he has nothing to go on since I gave no figures or costs. He has nothing to go on anyway because his point is flawed. More garda&iacute; were not deployed at Shannon than at the Love Ulster rally. To say otherwise is not true. The fact that only nine of Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s sympathisers turned up in the middle of the night at Shannon is <i>ex post facto</i>. If 500 of his friends had turned up, he would be the first to say if there had been an incident that I was unprepared for it.</P>
        <P>Going back to the Love Ulster events, either this House thinks it is better at policing events than the Garda or it does not. I do not under any circumstances pre-empt the way in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na chooses to allocate resources save to say that it enjoys unprecedented resources in terms of numbers and money. When the main constituents of the rainbow Government were in office, the number of garda&iacute; fell.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If the Garda has such resources at its disposal, why was it not possible to monitor the Internet traffic that showed there would be trouble in Dublin?

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Firearms training forms part of all specialist training conducted by the specialist training unit under the authority of the Garda College. I am advised by the Garda authorities that they have the use of Army firing ranges to facilitate Garda firearms training and have access to 12 such ranges countrywide. The total expenditure for the specialist training unit for 2005 was &euro;1,959,266 which includes all salary and related ancillary costs. This figure does not include travel and subsistence incurred by individual members undergoing the training.</P>
        <P>The number of garda&iacute; who carry arms on duty at any particular time is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. I have made it clear in the past that the traditional unarmed character of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been one its key strengths in maintaining its public reputation as an approachable force which polices by consent rather than fear. This is a tradition which any reasonable member of the public would want continued.</P>
        <P>Instruction governing the use of firearms and practical-tactical training is provided for each firearm on issue to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Members must achieve the necessary skills and standards to meet the aims and objectives for each firearms course. There is also an ongoing annual recertification programme, which includes refresher training.</P>
        <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who successfully complete the relevant firearms training course are issued with a certificate of competency in the particular firearm. To carry a firearm on duty the member&rsquo;s chief superintendent must issue the member with a firearm authorisation card. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total number of firearms cards issued for the year ending 31 December 2005 was 3,631 or approximately one quarter of the force. Responsibility for the use of a firearm resides with individual garda&iacute; in accordance with instructions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the most far-sighted and enlightened decisions of the founding fathers of the State was to have an unarmed police force, although I accept that armed back-up is necessary. Currently, 3,600 members of the Garda <Col N="866"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na hold firearms certificates and it is imperative that they have the highest professional training. Information supplied to me indicates that this is not the case as garda&iacute; have no firing range &mdash; the indoor ranges in Dublin and Templemore are closed &mdash; student garda&iacute; do not receive firearms training, garda&iacute; are only allowed to practise three times per annum, no tactical training is given and 500 new SIG 6 mm and 9 mm automatics are in stores with no one trained in their use.</P>
        <P>I understand a report is being compiled on the use of firearms. I understand this report, a copy of which I have sought but not yet received, may contain the following statement:</P>
        <P LI="1">The firearms training situation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is at present in crisis. This crisis arises from a failure to provide a clear operational and training policy, appropriate training facilities, a proper internationally recognised&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will abide by the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling. A serious issue arises in this regard because 3,600 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are being given inadequate training and do not have proper facilities to bring them up to the highest professional standards in the use of firearms. Guns are lethal instruments which can cause injury and damage to members of the force and the public.</P>

      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the suggestion that there is a crisis. The fact that more than 3,600 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are issued annually with a certificate for which they undergo testing every year speaks for itself. In 1985 when two certain parties were in government an indoor range was built in Garda headquarters. This range is out of service and awaiting complete refurbishment because concerns arose about the safety of the building which the Deputy&rsquo;s party constructed when in government. An external company has been engaged with a view to deciding how the building, which is only 20 years old, can be made safe and brought up to the proper standards.</P>
        <P>Last year the Garda authorities submitted proposals to my Department for the provision of two Garda firearms training facilities. These are being considered by officials in my Department in consultation with the Office of Public Works. In the medium term it is planned to provide a new centre of excellence for the Garda College. A site for this centre, which will cater for a broad range of tactical training requirements for the force, including facilities for firearms training, is being sought. The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied current firearms training is adequate for the present firearms training needs of the force.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="867"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister not accept that this is an extremely serious issue, for which he has responsibility? Does he accept that the information I cited, which was passed on to me anonymously by what I believe to be credible sources, indicates a serious state of affairs? The Minister should take responsibility in this matter and ensure deficiencies in firearms training are remedied immediately before a serious injury or accident results.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that if the Garda Commissioner asks me for resources for firearms training and makes proposals &mdash; he has already proposed the establishment of two centres &mdash; which can be implemented, the question of resources will not arise. It is simply a matter of giving the Garda approval to put in place what is appropriate for the force. No Minister in the history of the State has given the Garda as many resources as are currently available to it. I will not stint any resource as far as garda&iacute; being properly equipped to carry out their duties is concerned. I am satisfied the particular problem which emerged with the 20 year old indoor firing range erected when the Deputy&rsquo;s party was in government is being addressed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this important document because it represents a positive contribution to the agenda of North-South co-operation. The Government is focused on developing North-South co-operation across a full spectrum of areas. In terms of the specific areas referred to by the Deputy, a wide range of co-operation is already in place. An intergovernmental agreement on police co-operation was signed by the Irish and British Governments in 2002. This provides the framework for the implementation of the Patten recommendations which relate to the ongoing enhancement of North-South police co-operation. Closer communication and co-operation between our police services will directly <Col N="868"/>assist in crime prevention and detection and can only improve the effectiveness of cross-Border policing and the fight against terrorism, drugs, smuggling and other organised crime to the benefit of all the people of this island.</P>
        <P>Protocols for a programme of personnel exchanges and secondments between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland have been agreed. Secondments and exchanges will provide a two way flow of experience and expertise which will enhance policing standards in both organisations. Personnel exchanges have now commenced between the two forces and I intend to expand the programme. Work is progressing on other aspects of the intergovernmental agreement, such as joint emergency planning, joint investigations, training and annual conferences.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware of the considerable amount of co-operation that takes place between the bureau and the Assets Recovery Agency in Belfast and London. Investigations are carried out in conjunction with UK Customs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Assets Recovery Agency and the Revenue Commissioners. Operations have led to prosecutions and resulted in the forfeiture of assets and the breaking up of a number of organised crime gangs involved in illegal cross-Border activity. Only today, a joint CAB-ARA operation was conducted along the border into the activities of a well-known member of the Provisional IRA.</P>
        <P>With regard to sex offences, the Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains provisions on persons travelling to and from this jurisdiction. Close liaison is maintained between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of persons subject to the Act and information on the movements of such persons is exchanged for policing purposes. A memorandum of understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, with regard to sex offenders has been negotiated by my Department and the Home Office and I expect Government approval for this shortly.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on floor of House.</P>
        <P>The intergovernmental agreement on North-South co-operation on criminal justice matters was signed on behalf of the Irish and British Governments in July 2005. Under the agreement, a registered sex offenders advisory group has been established consisting of representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, my Department and the Northern Ireland Office. This group will evaluate the potential for sharing information, including potential benefits and barriers, and will identify areas for future co-operation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Government will continue to push forward the North-South agenda. While proposals for all-Ireland criminal agencies such as those <Col N="869"/>proposed would raise constitutional and legislative difficulties, the Government will continue to promote closer co-operation between the two jurisdictions in all areas where it will prove beneficial to the people of this island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am glad the Minister welcomes the proposals, can we make progress in implementing them? For example, the Criminal Assets Bureau has admitted that about 35% of its investigations into money laundering, smuggling and drugs are conducted on both sides of the Border and that its powers are different to those of the Assets Recovery Agency. The ARA can only investigate matters when the PSNI specifically requests it to do so, whereas the CAB has its own powers and responsibilities. We need a common agency with the same powers and an overarching mandate in both jurisdictions. The same applies with regard to intelligence on crime and terrorism matters. Rather than basic co-operation on registers of sex offenders, a common register is needed to cover the entire island.</P>
        <P>While we have done some work in terms of co-operation, we have done little to create a single all-Ireland agency in these areas. Can we not, in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, implementation bodies and the North-South Council, begin to harmonise the powers of the agencies to benefit the citizens of both jurisdictions? A single agency should have responsibility in some areas, such as a single sex offenders register or a joint criminal assets bureau. These would be more beneficial in terms of delivering services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have great sympathy for the Deputy&rsquo;s point that a single agency should combine the functions of CAB and ARA on an all-island basis. There is significant scope for cross-Border agencies of this kind and the changes made to the Constitution in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement make provision for their establishment. As a footnote, on a recent perusal of archival material in my Department, I noticed that some exciting proposals were made during the Sunningdale negotiations by the Irish Government for joint policing initiatives. However, we have to learn to walk before we run. We have to ensure the basis for co-operation between the forces of law and order on either side of the island is enhanced and that interpenetration takes place through secondments so as to build the necessary trust.</P>
        <P>In principle, I support proposals to establish a single criminal intelligence body but we must be aware of political realities in Northern Ireland. It was difficult enough to persuade the majority community there to accept the Patten proposals, let alone introduce an all-Ireland dimension to some aspects of policing.</P>
        <P>I strongly support any method whereby common notification can be made of sex offenders who are registered on either side of the Border <Col N="870"/>upon conviction in the UK or Ireland, if not a single register of such offenders. However, a single sex offenders register would probably necessitate an alignment of criminal law in the area of sexual offences because complications would otherwise arise in terms of putting people on the same register if each jurisdiction provided for difference consequences for offences. I have an open mind on the question of whether a mutual recognition system or a single register is the correct approach. I concur with the Deputy that it is essential that sex offenders registers be made interoperable at the very least.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, this matter has been the subject of a considerable amount of correspondence over the years. The Garda authorities inform me that the case concerns an offence in which the person referred to by the Deputy was fired at and assaulted. The case was the subject of a thorough Garda investigation and a file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who directed that seven charges be preferred against a third party as follows: causing serious harm, assault causing harm, assault, endangerment, two charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition and reckless discharge of a firearm.</P>
        <P>The case was heard at Donegal Circuit Court on 13 and 14 December 2000. The accused pleaded guilty to the fifth and sixth charges and the remaining charges were contested. After two days, the jury found the accused not guilty on the other charges. In respect of the two charges to which the accused pleaded guilty, a two year prison sentence suspended and one year prison sentence suspended were handed down, respectively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no role in the investigation or prosecution of cases. This is a long-standing principle of our system of justice. The role of the Garda is to investigate alleged offences, gather whatever evidence may be available and submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The question of whether a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP. The Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda material given to him and on statute law.</P>
        <P>The courts are independent, subject only to the Constitution and the law, in the exercise of their functions. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the conduct or outcome of any individual court case, which is entirely a matter for the presiding judge, assisted in this case by a jury. A variety of factors are taken into account by a judge in deciding on any particular case, and decisions on sentencing are reached by a judge after hearing the evidence presented and assessing the circumstances of the case in the context of the verdict reached by the jury.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>his Department&rsquo;s budget for implementing the major new provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[9683/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied there is adequate provision in the 2006 allocations to implement the major provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. The Garda budget for 2006 is &euro;1.29 billion, an all-time high, and represents an increase of 13% on <Col N="872"/>the allocation for 2005, which was itself a record allocation.</P>
        <P>The Act provides for the establishment of a number of new organisations, in particular the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission and the Garda inspectorate. A provision of &euro;10.01 million has been made in the Justice, Equality and Law Reform Vote for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission, and a provision of &euro;1.902 million has been made in the same Vote for the Garda inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The Act also provides that I may issue guidelines for the establishment by each local authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of joint policing committees. I am proposing that joint policing committees should be established on a pilot basis in a number of local authority areas as a first step and I will issue the necessary guidelines shortly. They have been the subject of consultation between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This approach is based on advice I received from the review group on the implementation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, whose report I published last month. Senator Hayes is an enthusiastic supporter of a Garda reserve force.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government propose to make available &euro;600,000 in total for the operation of the committees on a pilot basis when they are established this year. There is adequate provision in the Garda Vote to meet my Department&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;300,000.</P>
        <P>The Act also provides for the establishment of reserve members. A sum of &euro;1.28 million has been allocated in the Garda Vote this year for the recruitment of reserve members. That was the subject of extensive publicity when the Estimates were published last year. The Act provides for the transfer of responsibility for civilian staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from my Department to the Garda Commissioner. This is planned for September 2006. The cost of these staff is borne on the Garda Vote and there is provision in that Vote of more than &euro;46 million for clerical, industrial and other civilian staff. Full provision has been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to see provision being made in all those areas. It is strange that approximately &euro;10 million is being provided for the ombudsman commission but it will not be operational this year. I do not know where that money will go. Only &euro;1.28 million is being provided for the Garda reserve force and 900 of these members will be operating this year. It appears disproportionate.</P>

	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of the most important element of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, the joint <Col N="873"/>policing committees and the community policing section, the Minister appears to indicate that this will be a private arrangement. Is he indicating that it will be privately funded? It seems this will be the core of the legislation, and if it is to be successful, it will require resources for the local authority and communities involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s minute is concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Garda and employment of extra garda&iacute;, there will be much movement internally in various communities to get this operating effectively. There appears to be adequate provisions for other areas, but there seems to be a shortage of the provisions made for community policing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to local policing committees, these will not be provided with new buildings or furniture. The committees will function in existing premises. Most of the associated costs are administrative, and most of the support for the committees themselves will be supplied by administrative staff from existing bodies.</P>
        <P>There are funding programmes which already aid bodies such as community crime forums and similar matters. They are not the same as funds going to establishing the local policing committees. The existing resources for those types of operations, which come from State sources, are not all tied up together in the &euro;600,000 package. That is intended as new money to support the costs of the pilot scheme of local policing committees. It is not a question of private funding. However, local authorities will be expected to fund local policing forums, as they have done in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that the new Bill is in place, does the Minister involve himself in establishing priorities for funding? I mentioned earlier needs such as the obvious inadequacies in matters such as firearms training. Issues have recently become evident such as inadequacies in driver training, school lecturer numbers, etc. There are regular reports of a lack of equipment and 20 year old walkie talkies. Deputy Costello earlier mentioned the lack of proper uniforms and shirts. Does the Minister take any involvement in isolating such problems?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Some garda&iacute; have only one pair of trousers apiece.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Trousers are even more important. Does the Minister consider the main needs and requirements and prioritise them accordingly? I get a continuous stream of complaints relating to all these aspects which seem to be of no concern to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, the Minister gives overall policing priorities <Col N="874"/>for the year to the Garda Commissioner. The Commissioner&rsquo;s function is to come up with proposals of his own with regard to individual areas of policing operations and give them to the Minister. If the Deputy is asking me if I order the Commissioner to buy an extra set of trousers for every garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister raise the question of whether we need a water cannon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be allowed to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Garda&iacute; would need a change of trousers if we had a water cannon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The water cannon is a very simple issue, and perhaps the Deputy will hear my answer. I asked the Commissioner, in light of recent events, whether it was satisfactory that the six water cannons in Northern Ireland, costing approximately &pound;800,000 sterling, or over &euro;1 million each, are the sole source of water cannons on this island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>They could be on permanent loan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Commissioner&rsquo;s view that if one water cannon was bought, another would have to be purchased as they are complex instruments and if one breaks down there would have to be a back-up. In his view, he would get much better value for &euro;2 million relying on the mutual assistance arrangements between the PSNI and the Garda, rather than having water cannons lying in a depot. I can imagine if we had two extra water cannons, with one of them malfunctioning, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe would get his usual letter with a dog-eared corner detailing the secret information that one of the water cannons was not working. He would ask what the Minister proposed to do about it.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of initiatives have been undertaken by the community relations section of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the last ten years in response to crime directed against tourists. Crime prevention cards and booklets are made available to tourists through airports, car hire firms, tourist accommodation and at tourist attractions. These provide information on personal security and give advice on issues such as keeping money safe, where to park safely in urban centres and advice on traffic laws.</P>
        <P>There is regular and ongoing contact between the Irish Tourist Assistance Service and the Garda community relations section with the object of further improving the police service for tourists, in particular in such areas as language, cultural and environmental difficulties and unreported crimes. In addition data on crimes reported to the service are made available to inform future policing needs for tourists. Each year Garda divisional officers from the Dublin metropolitan region participate in the annual conference of the service.</P>
        <P>The Garda community relations section also provides input to the training needs of the volunteers who provide a service to tourist crime victims. This service was provided with funding totalling &euro;50,000 in 2005 by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime and is based in offices provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its Harcourt Square premises. Neighbourhood policing units in Dublin also provide tourist assistance in areas where criminal activity against tourists is at times a problem.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to note that there were significant reductions in 2005 in the incidence of robbery <Col N="876"/>from the person, which was down 23%, and theft from the person, down 18%, the crimes that most affect tourists.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year has the highest level of resources in its history &mdash;&euro;1,290 million, which represents an increase of &euro;146 million or 13% on 2005. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is &euro;83.5 million, an increase of &euro;23 million on the allocation for 2005. This increase will greatly assist the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention, including criminal activity as it affects tourists. The &euro;83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister acknowledge that almost 500 tourists were victims of crime in Ireland last year? That is unacceptable. People increasingly choose destinations which are welcoming and safe and it is of no benefit to the tourism industry to have such high crime figures. While the number of robberies fell, theft accounted for approximately 60% of those crimes. Is the Minister concerned about that? Does he have any proposals or plans for dealing with the situation better than we are doing at the moment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To be a victim of crime while visiting any country is appalling and it wrecks a tourist&rsquo;s whole experience. There is in all European countries a tendency in criminal quarters to target tourists and I do not believe we are any different. However, 500 out of the total who visit Ireland is a very small minority. We have set up the Irish Tourist Assistance Service which had 293 referrals in 2005, 17% less than the previous year&rsquo;s figure of 353. Some 476 tourists benefited from assistance given by the service while 357 days were spent on helping tourists solve problems arising from such crime. There are interesting figures on the Irish Tourist Assistance Service&rsquo;s website, which I recommend to the Deputy, and information on where offences were committed etc. The highest incidence was in Dublin and, for the first time, Galway stations referred the most cases outside Dublin with ten, County Wicklow referred nine; County Kerry, six; County Clare, five; and County Limerick, four. They are small figures, however, and we should not talk up the problem and damage our tourism industry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that there have been three recorded incidents involving the use of so-called pipe bombs recently in Dublin, all of which required the services of an Army explosives ordnance disposal, EOD, team.</P>
        <P>In the first incident, which occurred at approximately 4.25 p.m. on 8 February 2006 outside a residence in Coolock, a small, flask-like object fell from the boot of a car on to the ground and broke. Moments later, thankfully after the persons in the immediate vicinity, whose suspicions were raised, had an opportunity to move away, the device exploded causing minor damage to nearby cars. Fortunately, no persons were injured. An Army EOD team attended the scene and confirmed that a pipe bomb had exploded and that the area was clear.</P>
        <P>In the second incident, which occurred on 10 February outside a residence at Roseglen Avenue in Kilbarrack, a substantial explosion occurred under a car parked in the driveway. Significant damage was caused to the car in question and to the front of the residence, although again, thankfully, no persons were injured. The services of an Army EOD team were sought, and a thorough examination of the scene revealed no further devices.</P>
        <P>Unlike the previous two incidents, the third incident, which occurred at approximately 8 a.m. on 15 February, involved a hoax device placed underneath the private car of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attached to the national bureau of criminal investigation. At the time, the car was parked in the driveway of the member&rsquo;s private residence. Again, an Army EOD team attended the scene and determined, after expert examination, that the device was a hoax.</P>
        <P>In all three cases, the scenes were preserved for technical examination. The devices were examined by the Garda technical bureau and the three incidents remain under active investigation.</P>
        <P>Given the spate of such incidents in what is a relatively short period of time, it is natural that there has been much speculation about possible links between the incidents. While the incidents remain under investigation, and I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome, it is not possible to be definitive on the matter. However, at the moment the Garda believes there is no link and that the three cases all involve different people doing different things.</P>
        <P>There has also been speculation that the pipe bombs were manufactured by dissident republican groups and sold on to criminal gangs. I am not in a position to confirm or deny this speculation, but I do not believe the three incidents are connected, even on the basis of the manufacturer of the devices. Without commenting on any spec<Col N="878"/>ific incident, there is concern about interaction between dissident republican groups and criminal gangs. The situation is further complicated by the involvement of the groups themselves in general criminality.</P>
        <P>Although there were three such devices in fairly rapid order, the evidence seems to suggest they were unconnected, different in character and not put together by the same people &mdash; a coincidence rather than a pattern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree that such a huge increase in the use of firearms as we have seen recently is extremely alarming? There was an increase of 20% in the seizure of firearms in 2005 over 2004 and a 250% increase in the number of fatalities from firearms arising from gangland feuds etc. Now pipe bombs have appeared on the crime scene in north Dublin, not to mention the tragic shooting a couple of days ago of Donna Cleary in the same general area. This indicates that a substantial amount of dangerous weaponry is coming into the country which is linked to drugs and being used in a more indiscriminate fashion than could have been contemplated in the past. There seems to be very little that the authorities, including the Minister and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, can do about it. It is causing considerable alarm in the public domain as citizens worry that this lawlessness and criminality is becoming commonplace. It has progressed from a very unusual occurrence involving few deaths a few years ago to widespread attacks on human life.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been trying to raise the issue of the closure of Priorswood post office on <Col N="883"/>Clonshaugh Avenue, Dublin 17, for the past three weeks. On behalf of the people of Priorswood, I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating this issue.</P>
        <P>Over the past three years, creating a secure, long-term future for An Post has occupied much of the House&rsquo;s time. There was a lengthy industrial dispute resulting in the company&rsquo;s failure to pay national pay awards and the long ensuing struggle in the system of collection and delivery that lasted until the end of 2005. At the same time, grave concerns about rapidly falling numbers of post offices have been expressed throughout the national network. As the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources heard, the Irish Postmasters Union drew attention to the large reductions in the network from approximately 2,000 outlets a decade ago to fewer than 1,400 18 months ago.</P>
        <P>Since he was transferred to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has presided over the closure of a post office once every three weeks. For example, 18 post offices were closed in 2005, including in Brandon in County Kerry, Coolbawn in County Kilkenny, Broadford in County Kildare, Fourmilehouse in County Roscommon, Rathfeigh in County Meath and Killiney in Dublin. ComReg&rsquo;s recently published residential and business postal survey showed that the bulk of Irish businesses continued to rely on An Post and spent an average of &euro;6,000 each in 2005. A total of nine items of mail were delivered on average to each Irish home address per week and five items on average were posted weekly by Irish households. As such, An Post remains a key element of the Irish economy and life. The company recently delivered an attractive leaflet entitled &ldquo;You Decide, We Deliver&rdquo; to each household and business in Ireland advertising its reorganised services.</P>
        <P>However, for the people of the 18 post office districts that closed in 2005 and my constituents in Priorswood parish, this promise rings hollow. Priorswood is typical of many parishes that have similarly suffered. Four weeks ago, a notice was placed in the post office in Priorswood announcing its immediate closure from 6 March and the removal of all post office services to Clarehall shopping centre in Dublin 13. Senior citizens and recipients of pensions and benefits were stunned by the announcement. Many senior citizens face the weekly trek to Clarehall or northside shopping centres with great dismay, as do mothers of young children and the many customers in the area living as much as a mile from public transport.</P>
        <P>Local traders led by our popular local pharmacist, Mr. John Corr, immediately contacted An Post and I to seek a reversal of the decision. Following my discussions with Mr. Matt Lennon and other An Post officials, it became clear that the postmistress of Priorswood had decided on economic and security grounds to relocate to the <Col N="884"/>Tesco-owned Clarehall shopping centre. The closure of Priorswood post office has been a grave inconvenience and terrible setback for the more than 2,000 households of Priorswood parish.</P>
        <P>The closest post office, at northside shopping centre, has a large catchment area and long queues are often a feature of its operation. Priorswood post office was clearly a viable operation and the abrupt closure without any consultation with residents, community leaders and public representatives is unacceptable. An Post does not seem to have any rules, regulations or criteria covering post office closures or openings, as I will propose in my concluding remarks. Are there any regulations or criteria and why have I not received them to show my constituents and interested local traders?</P>
        <P>The Clarehall shopping centre lies at the southern end of a large new urban development of up to 20,000 housing and ancillary commercial developments called the &ldquo;north fringe&rdquo;. It is clear that this district needs and will have at least one post office. The residents of Clarehall and adjoining estates are happy to receive a postal service, which is to be welcomed. However, the residents of Priorswood parish feel badly let down by An Post. I was grateful to meet An Post&rsquo;s chief operations officer, Mr. Larry Donald, last Thursday in this building. He gave me a thorough briefing on the Priorswood situation and An Post generally but believed the closure was irreversible. I told him the local Clonshaugh shopping centre traders led by Mr. Corr were quite prepared to open a new post office in Priorswood, which should be seriously considered. I hope Mr. Corr, Mr. Lennon and their colleagues will meet Mr. Donald and his executive team in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Recently, An Post announced the selection of its financial services partner Fortis from the European mainland, which will give a significant boost to the operation of all remaining post offices. The proposed financial services and products for citizens who never had the opportunity to avail of these in the past is a real possibility and a bright point in the future for the An Post company.</P>
        <P>Priorswood parish lies in the heart of the original Northside partnership operation area, having suffered serious social disadvantage, unemployment and associated problems over the past two decades. The people of the parish loved the post office and desperately need a postal service. The new Clare Hall service is now operational and Priorswood is closed but citizens are willing to provide a new service for Priorswood. Action should be taken by Mr. Donald and the An Post management team. Similar consideration should be given to all other areas that wish to retain much-loved post offices.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding in this debate on behalf of the Mini<Col N="885"/>ster for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
        <P>The future development of An Post is, in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of An Post. The Government is fully committed to An Post remaining a strong player in the Irish postal market but the market will change over the coming years. The Government recognises the invaluable contribution made by An Post and its staff down through the years. It recognises the contribution of An Post to the overall business environment and it also accepts the role played by rural post offices and the staff of An Post, especially in rural areas, in contributing to the social fabric of rural society.</P>
        <P>On the future of the postal services, I believe that An Post will continue to play a key national role. It will continue to deliver post and provide Government and financial services through its nationwide network of post office outlets. The market for traditional postal and post office services is changing globally. Meeting customer needs has become more important than ever and international forecasts now predict that these challenges are likely to grow in intensity and complexity over the coming years.</P>
        <P>To remain competitive, An Post needs to build on its long established and trusted brand name. It also needs to deploy its resources in a manner which continues to serve existing customers&rsquo; needs and attracts additional customers for a range of new services. There is also widespread agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to offer a high quality nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future. An Post management and the main trade union, the Communications Workers Union, have recently signed up to a recovery plan, incorporating details of proposed new collection and delivery arrangements, which the Government believes will assist the company in meeting the challenges of an increasingly competitive and technologically changing postal market. Other unions had already signed up to changes.</P>
        <P>The challenge for An Post concerning the post office network is to develop a strategy that satisfies the needs of existing customers, while attracting new customers into post offices. An Post has already had some success in winning new business and continues to benefit from a considerable amount of Government business, especially in the areas of social welfare payments and savings products.</P>
        <P>The network of An Post comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country. Ireland has one of the highest number of post offices per head of population in Europe. In recent years, some network restructuring has been undertaken in line with similar trends across Europe. In addition to the post office network, An Post has also established 2,864 Postpoint outlets in retail premises of which 600 can be used for bill payment.</P><Col N="886"/>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s objective to maintain the largest economically sustainable post office network possible. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain as large a network as is sustainable. The network has a high footfall and to capitalise on these advantages, it is essential that existing and new services are developed to meet customer requirements. The network also has the capacity and potential to deliver more private business, especially in financial services. Opportunities in this area are being pursued by An Post.</P>
        <P>On foot of substantial investment in computerisation, a significant amount of extra business has already been obtained for the network in terms of banking and utility business. At present 95% of An Post&rsquo;s business is conducted through its 991 automated offices.</P>
        <P>The Minister has also asked the company to ensure that any strategy for its development should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network. An Post is working on a new financial services initiative. This could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices in partnership with another financial services partner. Following recent Government approval, the management of the company has begun detailed exclusive negotiations with its preferred partner. If the initiative proves to be successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.</P>

      <sTitle>European Enforcement Order.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue concerns a scam that was the subject of an article by Neil Callanan in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on 30 January 2005. The scam is operated by an outfit called European City Guide, based in Spain. European City Guide sends a form to unsuspecting small businesses, such as professionals, charities, galleries and schools. The form appears to be one that requests an update of contact information, such as current address, telephone and e-mail. When the unsuspecting recipient signs the form and returns it, European City Guide claims this represents an order for an advertisement on a CD-ROM guide and relies on small print on the form to support this claim. The victim of the scam cannot withdraw from the so-called order and European City Guide uses debt collectors to demand payment. Initially this sum is for &euro;800-1,000 but increases as time goes by. I understand some victims have bills for several thousand euro.</P>
        <P>The scam is operating on a European basis. European City Guide used to operate from Barcelona before the Catalan authorities, acting on 3,500 complaints from Europe, prosecuted the company and fined it &euro;300,000 in 2002. It now operates from Valencia and has engaged debt collectors called Premium Recovery, based in Switzerland. A web-based campaign against European <Col N="887"/>City Guide has, until now, advised victims not to pay. However, the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Enterprise, Trade and Employment must give their urgent attention to a new development. Debt collectors for European City Guide are now threatening victims that they will use provisions of the European enforcement order legislation, in effect since November 2005, to force victims to pay. The European enforcement order legislation allows court orders made in one member state to be legally enforced in another.</P>
        <P>The advice to victims has changed somewhat since this development. European City Guide can apply to the court in Spain and, if the case is not defended, easily obtain a certificate stating the company is owed a debt. This is sent to the High Court Registry in Ireland and I understand the Master of the High Court may be obliged to enforce the order. Small businesses faced with demands for extortionate payment from the company may find that an order granted in Spain may be enforced in Irish courts.</P>
        <P>For victims of the scam, the alternative is to instruct a solicitor and defend the case but this costs a considerable amount. The European enforcement order was never intended to allow scamming companies to engage in cross-border fraud to extract money from small businesses. European legislation offers no protection to businesses and we need new or amended legislation to stop European City Guide operating and to protect its victims.</P>
        <P>Hundreds of small businesses and professionals may have already been stung. Until now, they did not have to pay but the European enforcement order legislation may have changed this. I ask the Ministers concerned to see how this can be addressed. I will return to this subject when the Ministers have had the opportunity to examine the case fully.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. On his behalf, I take the opportunity to outline the main features of the instrument which has been referred to by Deputy Gilmore. It should become apparent that the instrument has a particular and laudable purpose and it is regrettable if that purpose is being misused. However, if individuals or companies believe they are being subjected to demands for money which are potentially criminal in nature, they have the right, as have all citizens, to make a complaint to the appropriate law enforcement authorities who are best placed to take this matter further should this be warranted.</P>
        <P>The reference is to Council Regulation No. 805/2004 which created a European enforcement order for uncontested claims. Being a regulation, the instrument is binding in its entirety and directly applicable. It has applied fully in this jurisdiction from 21 October 2005. A statutory <Col N="888"/>instrument, SI No. 648 of 2005, also came into operation on that date with the aim of ensuring that the necessary provisions for the good administration of the regulation were put in place. Rules of court were also brought into operation in the Superior Courts, the Circuit Court and the District Court.</P>
        <P>The key premise upon which the regulation is built is that by creating a European enforcement order for uncontested claims, judgments in respect of such claims, provided they satisfy certain minimum standards, should be directly enforceable in all member states, Denmark being excluded, without any intermediate proceedings, such as a declaration of enforceability, being required. Thus, if an Irish judgment for an uncontested claim is certified as an EEO, should it be necessary to enforce the judgment in, for example, Germany, the creditor will be able to avail immediately of the enforcement mechanisms which are available in that country. Equally, a German creditor in equivalent circumstances will be able to have immediate recourse to Irish enforcement mechanisms, such as the system of execution offered by the sheriffs or county registrars.</P>
        <P>It must be emphasised that the EEO comes in at the end of a process. It does not have a life of its own which is independent from the judgment which is given by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Against that background, the regulation applies to judgments given in respect of uncontested claims where the claim in question is for the payment of a specific sum of money that has fallen due. For the purposes of the regulation, a claim is regarded as uncontested where the debtor has expressly agreed to it by admission; the debtor has not objected to it during the course of the relevant court proceedings, or notwithstanding an initial objection, the debtor has subsequently failed to enter an appearance.</P>
        <P>For a judgment to be capable of being certified as an EEO it must be enforceable in the member state where it has been granted, it must comply with certain minimum standards and it must not conflict with certain jurisdiction roles. There is also a special provision to safeguard the right of a consumer debtor to be sued in their member state of domicile.</P>
        <P>The minimum standards necessary for a judgment to be certified as an EEO fall under two broad headings, those relating to service and those relating to procedural guarantees concerning the provision of basic information about the claim and the steps necessary to contest it.</P>
        <P>The regulation admits of two types of service, service with proof of receipt by the debtor, which would include personal service and service without such proof, which would include postal service where the debtor has an address in the member state where the judgment is being given. Because the latter category of service is seen as having less certainty attached to it than the <Col N="889"/>former, a judgment given following this kind of service can only be certified as an EEO if there is a mechanism in place under national law which permits a defendant to apply for a review of the judgment in certain exceptional circumstances which are set out clearly in the regulation.</P>
        <P>On the question of procedural guarantees, the regulation specifies the information which must be provided at the time the relevant court proceedings in respect of the initial claim are instituted, for example, the amount of the claim and an indication as to why the claim is being made. Certain additional information, such as the time of the court hearing and the possibility that judgment may be entered for the creditor if an appearance is not entered or the claim is not contested, must also be provided.</P>
        <P>The regulation allows for the fact that, in certain circumstances, it may be necessary to rectify or withdraw an EEO which has already been issued. Furthermore, a judgment certified as an EEO may be challenged on the basis of the review mechanism which has been referred to earlier.</P>
        <P>From the above, it should be clear that the regulation contains a number of safeguards which are intended to ensure that it does not operate in an unjust fashion and in itself is not a catalyst for the activities highlighted by the Deputy. While the Deputy&rsquo;s highlighting of the issue to which he referred is to be welcomed, it remains the case that the activities instanced may well be ones which need to be brought to the attention of the appropriate law enforcement authorities who are best placed to deal with any follow-up action.</P>

      <sTitle>Asylum Support Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter. I question the reason the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is treating asylum seekers and the citizens of Kiltimagh, County Mayo, so badly. Inadequate provision has been made for the young male asylum seekers who come to Kiltimagh. The people of Kiltimagh have been let down. The citizens of Kiltimagh have always welcomed visitors to their town, not least asylum seekers, whom they welcomed with open arms. Several families who came to this small rural town in County Mayo were made feel very welcome as members of the community. They quickly integrated with the local community and took part in all the activities and the children attended the schools. They have become part and parcel of the place. The proof of this integration was when the entire community banded together to support a family threatened with deportation. Some members of the community accompanied the family when they were deported to the UK and stayed with them to support them.</P>
        <P>The centre for asylum seekers in Kiltimagh was reclassified from family to single person accommodation in January 2006. The centre consists of <Col N="890"/>two buildings, the Railway Hotel and an annexe located on the opposite side of the road. It was intended to place males in one building and females in the other. Following further consideration, the reception and integration agency agreed recently that the families residing at the Kiltimagh centre will be allowed to remain there until at least the end of the current school year. However, arrangements were made to allow for the accommodation of some males at the centre.</P>
        <P>I refer to a reply from the Minister to a parliamentary question asked last month which stated that the RIA would initially make up to ten placements in the annexe at this location and would monitor the arrangement on an ongoing basis. At present there are more than ten young males staying at the annexe. There were eight and six more arrived in the past two weeks, a total of 14. People are concerned that this number of ten has already been exceeded. The street where both facilities are located, James Street, is home to at least 14 elderly persons and many widows and widowers. A psychiatric outreach community facility accommodating psychiatric patients is also on the same street. There are fire safety questions about the Railway Hotel and the annexe. The effect of bringing so many single males into the street is seriously questioned. The maximum number of ten people staying in the annexe has been exceeded and it is feared this number will be exceeded to a greater degree.</P>
        <P>Why are reception centres being closed in places such as Limerick, where there are many facilities, and this centre remains open with single men living in a street in a rural town which lacks the facilities they require. It is almost as bad for those men as if they were in prison. They deserve better. They cannot work and they receive less than &euro;20 a week. All they can do is walk up and down on the street. It is not fair to them. They came to this country to get help from us, yet we treat them like this. It is not right.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that discussions took place with local community groups, but minimal discussions took place and the people of Kiltimagh have experienced difficulties communicating with the RIA. The Minister&rsquo;s reply contains a threat that the centre may be closed if the new category of asylum seeker is not accepted as this would have economic consequences for the town of Kiltimagh. The accommodation centre is of little relevance to the local community from an economic point of view. The centre is owned by a company based in County Kildare. Only one of the employees lives in the Kiltimagh area and the others live elsewhere or are non-nationals. There are no local suppliers of produce or services to the centre.</P>
        <P>From a Kiltimagh perspective, unless the clients accommodated in the centre are acceptable to the local residents and contribute to the way of life in Kiltimagh, the centre should be closed. The local community would prefer it to close than accommodate single people in such <Col N="891"/>large numbers. It is not conducive to the proper development of the town and is upsetting the balance of the community. The Kiltimagh community is welcoming and families with children have integrated with it. However to inject so many single men into a community that has nothing for them is unfair on the men and on the community. I hope the Minister will examine this situation. He has said the community would accommodate ten people and that it would be monitored, but there was no monitoring and in a short space of time the numbers exceeded ten. I ask the Minister to explain the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers and currently has a portfolio of 65 centres across the State for this purpose. To address the reduction in numbers and the change in profile of asylum seekers, the RIA embarked on a programme of downsizing its accommodation portfolio. The Kiltimagh centre has accommodated 80 asylum seekers in the recent past. The number in the centre today is approximately half of this figure. The Deputy should note that the RIA has, since its inception, reclassified centres as circumstances require as a normal part of its operations.</P>
        <P>The ongoing RIA downsizing saw the closure in 2005 of 15 centres with a combined capacity of 833 beds. To date in 2006, four centres with a combined capacity of approximately 270 beds have been closed and further closures and reclassifications are planned. Overall, the current downsizing has led to the closure of two accommodation centres in County Mayo. Only two centres now remain in County Mayo, one in Kiltimagh and the other in Ballyhaunis.</P>
        <P>The RIA considered the centre in Kiltimagh suitable for possible reclassification from family to single person accommodation. As part of the <Col N="892"/>reclassification of this centre the RIA intended to relocate its families to other centres where they could benefit from special facilities for children and young people which have been put in place, including pre-school facilities for very young children. However, following discussions, the RIA agreed that the families with school going children who currently reside at the centre would be allowed to remain there at least until the end of the current school year.</P>
        <P>The Kiltimagh centre consists of two buildings, the Railway Hotel and an annex, which is located across the road. The RIA has, thus far, allocated a total of 17 males to this building. The Minister never promised, as the Deputy has alleged, that a maximum of ten male asylum seekers would be sent to Kiltimagh. If the Deputy had cared to check the replies to the numerous questions the Minister recently answered on this topic, he would have seen that the Minister said: &ldquo;the RIA will shortly make up to ten placements in the annex at this location and will monitor the arrangements on an ongoing basis&rdquo;. That is what was done and, having done so, the RIA has only moved this week a further six male asylum seekers to the centre. The ages of these asylum seekers vary from early 20s to over 40. The RIA has also moved two female asylum seekers to the centre.</P>
        <P>The reception and integration agency will continue to monitor the situation in Kiltimagh. There are no reports of difficulties arising. However, the reality is that the State must be in a position to accommodate single asylum seekers and must use its existing accommodation for this purpose. If the State determined that the Kiltimagh centre was not suitable for this purpose it would have no choice but to withdraw from the contract. This would result in the loss of 16, mostly full time, jobs at that centre. I am sure the Deputy would not wish that outcome.</P>

	<P>I have acknowledged, on behalf of the Government, that the position of same-sex couples before the law, and others in caring relationships, including extending State recognition to civil partnerships between such persons, needs to be addressed. As indicated by the Taoiseach on 24 January 2006 at the launch of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution Report on the Family, I am setting up a working group charged with preparing an options paper on this issue.</P>
        <P>The working group will consider the categories of partnerships and relationships outside of marriage, including same-sex couples, to which legal recognition might be afforded, consistent with constitutional provisions. The report of the all-party Oireachtas committee as well as the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission will inform the work of the group. The membership of the working group and a work timetable are being finalised. I expect the working group to report to me in October following which I intend to formulate legislative proposals for consideration by Government.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 15 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputies to a series of four questions on this topic, Questions Nos. 27, 56, 64 and 65, which I answered on 2 February 2006. On that date, I stated that I had been informed by the director general of the Irish Prison Service that construction of the Cloverhill Prison education unit &mdash; comprising a physical education section and six general education classrooms &mdash; com<Col N="895"/>menced in 2002 and was virtually completed in 2003, and that the physical education section of the unit had been brought partially into operation and is used daily by prisoners up to the present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, it was not possible to commission the general education section of the unit pending the outcome of negotiations with the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association, POA, on revised working arrangements in the Prison Service. Agreement has since been reached with the POA on the change agenda and the new working arrangements are currently being rolled out across the prison system. This agreement reverses the unacceptable trend of spiralling overtime costs which has been a feature of our prisons operations for many years and as a result there was a reduction in the overtime bill of some &euro;13.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003. A key feature of the new working arrangements is the introduction of a new Prison Service escort corps. Essentially, this is a dedicated corps of staff whose task is to escort prisoners to and from court in new cellular vehicles, thus eliminating the need to resort to overtime working as had been the practice heretofore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a temporary measure, the Prison Service escort corps is operating from a section of the unit pending the completion of new accommodation for the corps. It is currently envisaged that this new accommodation will be completed by the second quarter of this year at which time the general education section of the unit will be opened.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 24 together.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify matters in relation to a range of media reports concerning the Omagh bombing and related matters, many of which serve only to confuse rather than clarify.</P>
        <P>I would like to deal first with the reported comments of assistant chief constable Sam Kinkaid who gave a briefing to the Omagh relatives on 22 February last. I am informed by the British authorities that Mr. <?oasys _ch ?>Kinkaid&rsquo;s briefing focused on the current status of the Omagh investigation. I am also informed that, contrary to media speculation, at no stage during the briefing did Mr. Kinkaid suggest that the garda&iacute; had failed to prevent dissident republican attacks in Northern Ireland in order to protect the identity of an informant. However &mdash; and this is where confusion may have arisen &mdash; I am further informed that Mr. Kinkaid did refer to a number of allegations made by a person which subsequently became the subject matter of inquiry by the so-called Nally Group.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will be aware that the Nally Group was established by my predecessor to examine the issues raised in a report submitted by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland in 2002. This report related to allegations made by the person in question concerning the handling of intelligence information about the activities of a paramilitary group in that year and about drug-related matters in 1995 and 1996. The Nally Group reported in 2003 and concluded that there was no foundation for the allegations which it examined.</P>
        <?oasys _ic14- ?>
        <P>There have been repeated media reports that one of the allegations under inquiry by the Nally Group was to the effect that the garda&iacute; failed to pass on information to the then RUC which could have prevented the Omagh bombing. I have repeatedly informed the House that, in fact, no such allegation was made to the Nally Group. On this point, the group says:</P>
        <P LI="1">The core allegations . . . . about events preceding the Omagh bombing are that:</P>
        <?oasys _ic0- ?>
        <P el="5">
          <?oasys _is1p4- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>a senior Garda officer would have been prepared, if a vehicle had in fact been stolen . . . to allow it to go through in order to protect [an] informant; and</P>
        <P el="5">
          <?oasys _is1p4- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>no intelligence was passed to the RUC about information, alleged to have been received on the eve of Omagh that the RIRA, who had been trying to steal a vehicle in the Dublin area, had obtained one elsewhere (place, vehicle type and destination unspecified).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These are very serious allegations. However they are quite different from allegations that the Garda&iacute; let the vehicle which was used in the bombing in Omagh go through or that they had <Col N="897"/>intelligence about that vehicle . . . which they had failed to pass on to the RUC. No such allegations have been made to the Group and no basis for any such allegations has come to its attention.</P>
        <P>As I have already stated, the Nally Group dismissed the allegations which were in fact made as being without foundation.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to go into the detail of matters relating to covert surveillance techniques which may or may not have been conducted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in any instance, for obvious reasons of national security.</P>
        <P>I can also inform the House that the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI are in contact about this matter and I expect that the Commissioner will report to me on the outcome of those contacts.</P>

        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and not I as Minister to put in place appropriate and proportionate operational policing plans for rallies, parades and similar events in the public arena. Such a comprehensive plan was prepared and in place in respect of the Love Ulster rally, and it was based on all information then available to the Garda authorities.</P>
        <P>I was in regular touch with the Garda Commissioner and his senior officers throughout the weekend in question. As with the Garda authorities, neither my Department nor I had any credible advance warning of the appalling riots which took place.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is comprehensively reviewing events which occurred at the Love Ulster rally with a view to identifying lessons that can be learnt for other upcoming events in Dublin and elsewhere.</P>

	<P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to applications for leave to remain in the State made pursuant to section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.</P>
        <P>It must be acknowledged that it is particularly difficult to provide meaningful statistics for the time period cited in the question given the transitional nature of asylum and deportation system at the time. First, the Immigration Act 1999 was implemented in November 1999 and, second, the full provisions of the Refugee Act 1996, as <Col N="900"/>amended, came into effect on 20 November 2000, that is, the date on which the two independent refugee status determination bodies, the refugee applications commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, were established on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>Generally, an application for leave to remain in the State in these circumstances arises where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is afforded three options, namely, to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a deportation order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a deportation order should not be made and why temporary leave to remain in the State be granted instead.</P>
        <P>In the period 1992 to 31 December 2000, 29,266 persons applied for asylum and, in the same period 1,815 were granted refugee status. It is important to note that decisions relating to asylum applications are recorded by reference to the date of the decision-determination rather than the date of application. Hence, the number of decisions-determinations made each year may not necessarily relate to applications made in the same year and many of the applicants in that period had their asylum applications decided in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>Details of those granted leave to remain in the period 2000 to date in the context of the deportation system under the Immigration Act 1999 are as follows:</P><Col N="899"/>

        <P FLI="0">As with the asylum application statistics above, the year in which a person is granted leave to remain is usually not the same as the year in which they sought asylum.</P>
        <P>It does not follow that a failed asylum seeker is automatically either issued with a deportation order or is granted leave to remain and the above statistics need to be examined in that context. Temporary leave is considered regardless of whether representations have been made by, or on behalf of, the person concerned. Consequently, records are not maintained which would distinguish the number of cases where representations have been received from those where no representations have been made. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that many of those who failed the asylum process, and who did not opt to return voluntarily on notification to the Department or consent to deportation, nonetheless left the State of their own volition before a decision to deport or grant leave to remain was made.</P><Col N="900"/>
        <P>Further, many persons who applied for asylum in the period concerned have since received alternate forms of leave to remain outside the process in the Immigration Act 1999 described above. For example, some may have married Irish or EU nationals and many would have been granted leave to remain based on their parentage of an Irish born child. In this latter respect, 10,584 persons were granted leave to remain based on their parentage of an Irish born child under the procedure which operated prior to the Supreme Court judgment in the L&amp;O case in January 2003 and a further 16,693 were granted under the subsequent IBC, 2005, scheme.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that under section 3(6) of the Act the Minister, in determining whether to make a deportation order or grant leave to remain shall have regard to 11 specified considerations, one of which is the length of time a person has spent in the State.</P>

	<P>My most recent contact with the Omagh victims and their families was in February 2006 when I issued responses to questions about the investigation that were submitted earlier to the Taoiseach. This response issued via the liaison officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs who was nominated by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to keep in contact with the families. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, met the families in Dundalk in October 2005 and my Department was represented at that meeting.</P>
        <P>Both the Government and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain anxious to offer assistance in any appropriate way, in accordance with law, in relation to the civil action. Liaison officers have been appointed in the Courts Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in my Department to assist in these matters.</P>
        <P>Representations were also made to me in relation to funding the civil action. The families, through their solicitors, sought a financial contribution from the Government towards the cost of the civil action being taken by them against the suspected perpetrators of the Omagh atrocity. I am of the view that it would be inappropriate for the Government to fund a civil action in another jurisdiction, and I was not prepared to offer this form of assistance.</P>

	<P>Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region on 17 May 2005 with a view to addressing the problem of serious crime such as gun crime, robberies and burglaries and combating an emerging gun culture. At my request Operation Anvil is being extended outside the Dublin metropolitan region during 2006. I have also obtained funding to enable Operation Anvil to continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational policing terms.</P><Col N="902"/>
        <P>All operational personnel in the Dublin metropolitan region may be employed on Operation Anvil as the need arises. Personnel from the Garda national units are also deployed on the operation as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The number of personnel deployed on the operation varies from time to time, depending on demands and available intelligence. Personnel from all Garda stations in the Dublin metropolitan region are actively involved in it. The operation has involved a large number of garda&iacute; attached to stations in the Dublin metropolitan region and other specialist sections in the crime and security branch and the national support services branch. To maintain operation flexibility there has been no absolute overtime allocation to each Garda station.</P>
        <P>There were 282,257 hours of overtime paid for Operation Anvil from its commencement up to 6 March 2006. The net incremental cost of the operation from its commencement to 6 March 2006 is &euro;11,084,254. This figure includes the cost of overtime, travel and subsistence and other ancillary costs.</P>
        <P>The most recent figures available show that Operation Anvil has contributed to encouraging outcomes, with a total number of arrests of 1,641 &mdash; which includes 23 arrests for murder, 411 arrests for serious assaults, 828 arrests for burglary and 379 arrests for robbery offences. Furthermore, the total number of firearms seized to date under Operation Anvil is 359, and property to the value of more than &euro;5.7 million has been recovered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that there are no applications awaiting a first instance determination with an application date prior to 1 January 2001. While the Refugee Appeals Tribunal has advised that there are no appeals with it with an appeal date prior to 1 January 2001, there are 11 appeals in the RAT with an application date prior to 1 January 2001. In addition, there are two cases in the ministerial decisions unit regarding applications prior to 1 January 2001 awaiting issue of a decision letter. For a variety of reasons, there will always be some applications and appeals which take significantly longer than the average to complete which can arise for reasons such as judicial review proceedings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to acknowledge the very significant progress made by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, and their respective staff, in addressing both the volume of cases on hands in both ORAC and RAT as well as the timescales involved in bringing a case to its conclusion. At the end of February 2006 there were 2,409 cases on hand at ORAC and RAT as compared to 6,930 cases in January 2004 and 3,629 in January 2005. The number of cases in each of the asylum agencies over six months was 470 at the end of February 2006 compared to some 1,057 in January 2005, 2,910 cases in January 2004 and some 6,500 in September 2001.</P>
        <P>There is continued momentum in processing timescales for asylum applications with new arrangements for speedier processing of prioritised asylum applications, from nationals of Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and South Africa, introduced from January 2005 with a 17 working days processing time at first instance in ORAC and 15 working days at appeals stage in RAT. Currently, almost 40% of total applications fall into the prioritised category.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 November 2005, all applicants for asylum are notified of their interview date by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner at the time they make their application. The interview appointment is normally within 20 working days of application. However, for those applicants within the prioritised category, interviews in ORAC are held, more speedily, within nine to 12 days.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 43 together.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department which will create a specific offence of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation as provided for in EU Council Framework Decision on combating trafficking in persons. The criminal law provisions in other international instruments, including the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish trafficking in Persons, especially women and children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings are also being taken into account in the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that there is no evidence to suggest that there is any increase in trafficking in persons into this jurisdiction for the purposes of sexual exploitation. I am further informed that evidence of any involvement by criminal gangs operating within or outside this jurisdiction in the trafficking or smuggling of non-nationals into the State is difficult to adduce.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes a proactive approach and is ever vigilant to ensure that any allegations relating to trafficking in human beings are vigorously investigated. A number of specific Garda operations have been put in place to discover the extent to which Ireland has been targeted by persons suspected of being engaged in trafficking in persons, to prevent such activity and, where such activity is disclosed, to gather evidence to be used in any prosecution which may be initiated. I am informed by the Garda authorities that these operations are ongoing. One such operation, Operation Quest, was established under the direction of the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services to investi<Col N="906"/>gate allegations that non-nationals are being trafficked into this country for the purpose of employment in the sex industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the course of Garda investigations garda&iacute; liaise as necessary with Ruhama, an NGO which assists women who are the victims of violence. Persons reporting that they have been trafficked are always treated sympathetically by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed that the Garda recently had discussions with the UK law enforcement authorities following the introduction there of Operation Pentameter, which was established to disrupt the activities of organised criminal gangs suspected of involvement in trafficking in human beings. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has agreed to support the operation through sharing of intelligence and to put in place appropriate enforcement activities arising from any possible displacement to this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that a training programme has recently been designed by personnel at the Garda National Immigration Bureau to assist all officers in recognising people who may be victims of trafficking and to enable them to receive the appropriate assistance from all the relevant agencies. The training will be delivered to all personnel by staff at the Garda College.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participates on the Interpol working group on trafficking in women. The group has recently published a manual for investigators which is a practical guide to best practice in the investigation of this type of criminal activity. Personnel from the Garda National Immigration Bureau also regularly attend meetings, seminars and conferences designed to share information and devise policies to combat immigration offences, including trafficking and smuggling of human beings.</P>
        <P>A working group on trafficking in human beings, chaired by my Department, is examining the extent and nature of trafficking into Ireland for the purposes of sexual exploitation and reviewing various measures in place to combat the phenomenon.</P>

        <Quest>the steps taken to improve management of compensation claims against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Acts; if further reforms are planned, including amendments to legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect to compensation claims against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, section 48 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 simplifies matters for members of the public taking civil actions against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The <Col N="907"/>section provides that the State is liable to an action for damages in respect of any damage resulting from an actionable wrong committed by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the course of performing the member&rsquo;s functions under the Act as if the State were the employer of the member. As a result of the section it will no longer be necessary for a litigant to name the individual member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the action. This section was commenced on 1 August 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With respect to claims by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the Deputy will be aware that each claim for compensation by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for malicious injuries received while on duty must be treated on its own merits. My Department is doing everything within its power to expedite and process these claims in a fair and efficient manner. In all cases, medical reports from the claimants' own doctors and the chief medical officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are required before a final decision can made on a claim. As the Deputy will appreciate, these cases can take some time to reach a conclusion, given the nature of the injuries received.</P>
        <P>In terms of reforming the process, the general form of a new compensation scheme has been agreed with the representative bodies of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and my Department is currently carrying out a regulatory impact analysis for its introduction. Following on from that I hope to bring a memorandum to Government for a new Garda Compensation Tribunal Bill and thereafter see its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acts as both the State&rsquo;s national police service and national security service. Ireland does not have a &ldquo;secret service&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its capacity as the State&rsquo;s national security service is to protect the State from national security threats from within and without, in association with the Defence Forces, as appropriate. For sound security and operational reasons, it is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to reveal details of numbers and locations of Garda members employed in national security service duties.</P>
        <P>As the national security service forms part of the general Garda organisation, there is no separate, dedicated budget for its operation; all costs associated with security service duties are sub<Col N="908"/>sumed into the general budgets within the Vote of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, it is not possible to provide, nor would it be in the public interest to reveal, details of the costs associated with national security service duties.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 32 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that following correspondence from the person&rsquo;s family, and a meeting with senior Garda officers, the Garda Commissioner directed that a review of the original investigation into the death of the person be conducted. The review was carried out under the direction and supervision of a detective chief superintendent and detective superintendent of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, NBCI.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The review was comprehensive in nature and involved the taking of 170 statements from family, friends, work colleagues and a wide range of people who had any interaction with the person during their life. Underwater searches were carried out by divers from the Garda underwater unit at the location where the person&rsquo;s body was discovered. Officers from the Irish Naval Service also carried out tests at the same location on a day when the prevailing sea conditions where similar to the day that the person&rsquo;s body was discovered, to observe the effect of the incoming tide on a body in the water. Assistance was also provided by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Extensive inquiries were also carried out for the purpose of obtaining any CCTV footage. Furthermore, the State pathologist reviewed the original post mortem carried out on the person.</P>
        <P>I am informed that there is no evidence from either the initial investigation into the death of the person or the recent review to suggest foul play. There were no injuries to the body to suggest anything other than death by drowning. This fact is borne out by the findings of the inquest into the death of the person and also corroborated by the medical evidence.</P>
        <P>On 22 February 2006 the detective chief superintendent from the NBCI met members of the person&rsquo;s family and explained in detail to them the results of the review.</P>

	<P>All parts of the Disability Act 2005 for which I have responsibility have been commenced with the exception of Part 6 which provides for the establishment of a centre for excellence in universal design in the National Disability Authority, NDA. Part 6 will commence on 1 January 2007. The commencement of Part 2 is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children, in consultation with the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The following parts and sections of the Act came into operation on 29 July 2005: Part 1 &mdash; Preliminary and General &mdash; which includes provisions relating to commencement, interpretation and provision of resources; sections 24 and 30-37 in Part 3 which relate to codes of practice and sectoral plans; and Part 7 &mdash; Miscellaneous &mdash; which includes provisions relating to amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2001 and the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>On 31 December 2005, the following provisions of the Act came into operation: sections 25-28 which relate to access to buildings, services and <Col N="910"/>information; sections 38-40 which relate to the complaints procedures surrounding access to buildings and services and sectoral plans; Part 4, which relates to genetic testing; and Part 5, which relates to public service employment. Section 29 of the Act which relates to access to heritage sites will come into operation on 31 December 2007.</P>
        <P>The following progress has been made on the implementation of the key provisions of the Disability Act that have been commenced. Departments have made provision for expenditure on service delivery in 2006 under the Act as required by section 5 of the Act. Departments and other public bodies are implementing the accessibility provisions of the Act including the appointment of access officers and the establishment of complaints procedures. The NDA has prepared a code of practice, at my request, in regard to sections 26, on accessibility to services provided by public bodies, 27, on accessibility of services supplied to public bodies, and 28, on access to information through communication formats. I have arranged with the Attorney General for formal drafting of an order for my signature to give effect to the code. The six Departments required to do so have produced outline sectoral plans relating to service delivery by those Departments and public bodies under their aegis. The Departments are involved in a major consultation process with a view to laying the plans before the Oireachtas not later than 28 July 2006. Departments, public bodies and the NDA are progressing the implementation of the provisions of the Act relating to the employment of people with disabilities.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It should be noted that Garda management states that all members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, to deal with community policing issues as they arise. The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved. In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; due to the programme of accelerated recruitment into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take place on 16 March 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda Commissioner will be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Dublin metropolitan area will be fully con<Col N="914"/>sidered within the overall context of the needs of Garda areas throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 58 together.</P><Col N="915"/>
        <P>I presume the Deputies are referring to the contents of my reply to Question No. 12 of 2 February 2006. In that reply, I dealt with the issue of female genital mutilation in Nigeria and the entitlement or otherwise to refugee status on this basis in the State. As I also indicated, it is not for me to determine who is and who is not a refugee. That is a matter for the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal within the framework of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to comment in any more detail on either of the issues raised by the Deputies. However, I would reiterate that the UK Home Office report of October 2005 on Nigeria points out, utilising other source material, that, <i>inter alia</i>, female genital mutilation is a cultural tradition practised in Nigeria and that its incidence has declined steadily in the past 15 years. The report also refers to the fact that the Nigerian Government publicly opposes this practice and while there is no federal law banning the practice, such prohibitions do exist at state level.</P>
        <P>The Home Office report also quotes a report of a British Home Office-Danish Immigration Service fact finding mission to Nigeria, published in January 2005, as indicating, <i>inter alia, </i>that there are groups in Nigeria who are against the practice of FGM and should a girl desire to avoid FGM in spite of pressure from her family to do otherwise she has the opportunity to complain to the Nigerian Police Force or the Nigerian Human Rights Commission and, in addition, she may seek protection from women lawyers or NGO&rsquo;s. According to BAOBAB, a Nigerian women&rsquo;s NGO, the Government and prominent NGOs in Nigeria provide protection to women escaping FGM. It confirms that most women throughout Nigeria have the option to relocate to another location if they do not wish to undergo FGM and Government institutions and NGO&rsquo;s afford protection. BAOBAB is also quoted as being of the opinion that FGM in itself is not a genuine reason for applying for asylum abroad. The Nigerian Human Rights Commission has indicated it would be surprised if someone actually had to leave Nigeria in order to avoid FGM instead of taking up residence elsewhere in Nigeria. According to BAOBAB internal relocation is a real option within Nigeria to avoid FGM and women actually take up this option.</P>

	<P>The Government has not yet considered the issue of introducing a national identity card. As Ireland shares a land border and a common travel area with the United Kingdom, I have been closely monitoring developments in the UK in relation to the introduction of the identity card scheme. My main concerns are the implications for the common travel area and for Irish people travelling to, living and working in the UK.</P>
        <P>While I am on record as being opposed to national identity cards in principle, I believe the introduction of the UK identity card may have implications for the approach we ultimately must take to this matter, particularly against the background of the common travel area. Having said that, I will wait and see the final version of the British scheme before finalising my views.</P>
        <P>I have discussed this issue with the Home Secretary on a number of occasions and I will be meeting him again shortly, when this matter will be discussed. My officials and officials from other Departments have been in constant touch with their counterparts in the Home Office on this issue, and the Irish Embassy in London has kept a close eye on the passage of the UK legislation. Whether Ireland introduces an identity card or not, it is becoming increasingly common for airlines to demand photographic identification for domestic flights and for flights within the common travel area. The decision to do this is purely a matter for the carriers; it is not a legislative requirement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 159 together.</P>
        <P>The person concerned entered the State as an unaccompanied minor in October 1999 and applied for asylum. Normal immigration controls were not applied to her and her entry to the State without a passport or valid form of identification <Col N="917"/>was allowed for the sole purpose of having an asylum claim determined. In May 2000, she withdrew her claim for asylum before it had been finalised and made an application for leave to remain based on her parentage of an Irish born child. She was granted leave to remain on this basis on 8 October 2002.</P>
        <P>In May 2004, the person concerned applied for a certificate of naturalisation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. Those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State, be of good character, have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years, intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation, have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that in the context of naturalisation certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The person concerned had not been resident in the State for five years at the time she applied and, consequently, her application was deemed ineligible. She was informed of this decision in writing in February 2006. Since she was granted leave to remain in October 2002 she will satisfy the residency requirements for naturalisation in October 2007, provided she maintains her permission without any gaps during this period. Any such application will be assessed against the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.</P>
        <P>While there is no provision to grant indefinite or permanent leave to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child, it is possible to obtain permission to remain without condition as to time. An application for such permission to remain can be made to the immigration division of my Department once the person concerned has resided in the State for a minimum of eight years.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 44 together.</P>
        <P>I am not clear what the Deputies mean when they refer to anomalies or unique circumstances pertaining to or surrounding applications for asylum from nationals of Somalia. There is a statutory framework governing the asylum determination process in Ireland set out in the Refugee Act 1996 and it is not for me as Minister to determine who is or is not a refugee. The 1996 Act established two independent statutory offices to consider applications and appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These offices are the refugee applications commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The processing of applications within the framework of the 1996 Act, in particular has due regard to the definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in section 2 of that Act, which states that a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; is &ldquo;... a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it&rdquo;.</P>
        <P> Every asylum applicant is guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance by the refugee applications commissioner. Each application is assessed on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to the subjective elements, the applicant&rsquo;s own account or personal history, and objective elements, up-to-date information on the applicant&rsquo;s country or place of origin. This country of origin information comes from a wide variety of sources, including organisations such as the UNHCR, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, UK Home Office, Canadian International Refugee Board, US State Department and other EU member states as well as media and Internet sources.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal also consider the well-foundedness of each individual <Col N="919"/>applicant&rsquo;s claim, that is, whether there are sufficient facts to permit the finding that, if returned to his or her country of origin, the applicant would face a serious risk of persecution. Credibility is also central to assessing an application, and it falls to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to decide whether the applicant&rsquo;s account is credible and whether he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution. Issues of relevance in assessing credibility include: contradictions-inconsistencies, plausibility of the applicant, and level of detail in the claim. A negative finding as to overall credibility will generally lead to a conclusion that the applicant does not qualify for protection.</P>
        <P>There must also be a link between the persecution as alleged and one or more of the grounds set out in both the 1996 Act and the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, namely, being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Our system also guarantees every asylum applicant a right of appeal to a statutorily independent and separate body &mdash; the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Every asylum applicant is also guaranteed access to legal assistance provided by the refugee legal service.</P>
        <P>The UNHCR is given full access to our refugee determination process and can examine any case at any time to ensure fair procedures and compliance with our Geneva Convention obligations. I would also refer the Deputies to my comprehensive reply to a series of parliamentary questions on asylum applications from nationals of Somalia, Questions Nos 187 to 189, inclusive, on 8 March 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The deportation operation referred to by the Deputy involved the return of 13 Chinese nationals to their country of origin by charter flight on 21-22 February 2006. This charter flight arrangement was made principally because some of the persons being returned had, by their disruptive behaviour, frustrated previous attempts to have them removed from the State.</P><Col N="920"/>
        <P>In regard to the escort levels provided for this charter, I am aware that the details provided in the question arise from a newspaper article published on the day of the charter. I should further state that, as has been the practice in regard to previous D&aacute;il questions on charters, I do not intend to comment on, or confirm, the level of Garda escorts provided for this operation. The Garda National Immigration Bureau is responsible for effecting removals from the State, including the escorting of deportees while on flights. The Garda Commissioner has advised me that all persons being deported are individually risk assessed by the Garda. This prior assessment determines the level of escort, if any, required.</P>
        <P>An advance party from the Garda National Immigration Bureau travelled to Beijing in advance to make the necessary arrangements with the Chinese authorities. This advance party stayed on for a couple of days after the returnees had arrived in Beijing to ensure that they were assisted in their transit through Beijing Airport. In this connection, modest financial assistance was provided to each returnee on arrival in Beijing to assist them with their onward transport to their individual places of origin within China.</P>
        <P>I should emphasise that the primary function of Garda escorts, whether on charter or commercial aircraft, is not to prevent cruel or unfair treatment being meted out to returnees upon their arrival in their country of origin. That function is inherent in the determination processes leading to the issue of a deportation order. Before a deportation decision is made in any individual case, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must have regard to the 11 factors contained in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and the provisions of section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>.</P>
        <P>This means that the safety of returning a person to their country of origin, or <i>refoulement,</i> as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether to make a deportation order. This means in practice that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The legislation requires that this consideration is given before the deportation decision is made. In arriving at such decisions, my Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that all national and international protection obligations were observed in the context of this recent deportation operation to China.</P>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers and has a portfolio of 65 centres across the State for this purpose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In March 2005 there was a total of 8,080 asylum seekers being accommodated by the RIA. Approximately 3,500 residents applied for leave to remain in the State under the Irish born children measures announced on 17 December 2004. Almost all of these residents have now left the RIA accommodation and as of 24 February 2006 there were 4,892 asylum seekers resident in accommodation centres. Within a relatively short space of time the numbers requiring accommodation has reduced and it is incumbent on the RIA to use the accommodation at its disposal in the most effective way and provide the best value for money for the Department and the taxpayer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to the exodus of families with Irish born children from RIA accommodation, the numbers and profile of persons seeking asylum has changed. The number of families seeking asylum in the State has dropped and the RIA, as a demand-driven organisation, is obliged to reflect this reality in the accommodation portfolio.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Due to the rapid fall in the numbers of persons requiring accommodation and the change in profile of asylum seekers, the RIA embarked on a programme of downsizing of its accommodation portfolio. This is intended to bring supply and demand into balance and will include the reclassification of some of the accommodation centres in order to optimise usage and obtain value for money. This downsizing has seen a number of centre closures during 2005, 15 centres with a combined capacity of 833 beds. To date in 2006, four centres with a combined capacity of approximately 270 beds have been closed and further closures-reclassifications are planned.</P>
        <P>The only accommodation centre for asylum seekers in the entire county of Tipperary is the centre in Carrick-on-Suir and the RIA has reclassified this centre as suitable for single persons. This centre has housed asylum seekers since 2001 without any significant matters arising in the intervening period. The RIA understands the degree of anxiety or unease that a local population may feel if a centre profile is changed from women, children and small babies to single persons. It is the RIA&rsquo;s experience that, over time, such feelings dissipate as the local population <Col N="922"/>come to know the individuals concerned and as their practical experience of the centre operation allays their initial concerns. The RIA has in its accommodation portfolio 16 male-only centres and no significant issues have arisen at these locations. In addition, the RIA has embarked on the reclassification of a portion of some of its larger family centres in order to accommodate single persons alongside families in Sligo, Meath and Monaghan.</P>

	<P>In relation to bail in general, during the term of office of the rainbow coalition the number of prisoners on temporary release reached an all time high of 20% at one stage.

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that of the 5,456 offences committed in 2005 by persons on bail, proceedings commenced against 3,353 persons to date, with 758 of those being convicted. Figures provided for 2005 are provisional, operational and liable to change.</P>
        <P>The Bail Act 1997 gave effect to the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution and tightened up the bail regime considerably.

	<P>Thirteen adults, 11 males and two females, were deported to Beijing in China by charter flight on 21-22 February 2006 at a total cost of &euro;255,539. This was the first such charter flight to China and, because of the long distance between Dublin and Beijing, it required two fuel stopovers in Leipzig, Germany and Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The flight had a medical team of a doctor and nurse. The flight was chartered through a UK company, Air Partner PLC, which is contracted to the Department following an EU-wide tender competition in 2005.</P>
        <P>The above cost does not include Garda expenses associated with this removal operation. I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that, given the wide range of immigration duties performed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda National Immigration Bureau in particular, it is not possible to identify the particular pay and overtime costs incurred by the Garda on charter flights. However, the Commissioner informs me that charter flights involve a lower ratio of Garda escorts to deportees than is the case using conventional scheduled flights, resulting in savings to the Garda budget.</P><Col N="924"/>
        <P>Of the 13 returnees, four had criminal convictions of various types. This charter was arranged principally to facilitate the removal of a number of persons who had frustrated previous attempts to remove them on commercial flights through violent and disruptive behaviour.</P>

The change of profile of a centre from family to single persons does not generally entail a requirement for access to any additional State services. Asylum seekers of any gender are entitled to access medical and social services in exactly the same way. However, the RIA has found that reclassification to single persons will generally mean that any pressures that may have existed in local schools, maternity wards and in pre and post-natal clinics, arising from the requirement to deliver a service to asylum seekers, are relieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is incumbent on the RIA to utilise its property portfolio to provide the best value for money. Memoranda of agreement require contractors to accept any person whom the RIA refers to the centre. Since its establishment the RIA and its predecessor &mdash; directorate of asylum seeker services, DASS &mdash; have reclassified numerous centres throughout the State from family to single persons and <i>vice versa</i> without any difficulties. The RIA informs all relevant service providers of a reclassification and, in the case of Carrick-on-Suir, will meet with the local asylum seeker support group shortly.</P>

	<P>I welcome the publication of this report which provides an important insight into the inequality and the stereotyping of young people today as perceived by the young people themselves. The report will be of interest to all groups who engage with young people.</P>
        <P>I do not, however, agree with the Equality Authority that there is an urgent need to extend the provisions of the Equal Status Acts on the age ground to people under the age of 18. The reason for excluding under 18s from claiming discrimination on the age ground is that 18 is a standard cut-off for access to many services, for example, it is the age of majority, the age at which contractual commitments are fully enforceable, the age for sale of drink, access to certain films and so on. It would be impractical to extend the age ground to under 18s as this would necessitate the provision of an extraordinary number of exemptions within the legislation and would entail a revisiting of virtually every area of the Equal Status Act. It would also mean that, in principle, it would no longer be permissible to give any preference, such as a reduced price, to young people.</P><Col N="929"/>
        <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>Under section 3(3) of the Equal Status Act 2000, a person who is less than 18 years of age cannot bring a claim of discrimination on the age ground. Equally, a person who is aged 18 or over cannot bring a claim of discrimination on the age ground which is based on a comparison with a person aged less than 18, for example, an adult cannot seek children&rsquo;s fare on a bus. I emphasise, however, that the Act does apply to discrimination against under 18s based on the other eight grounds. It is, therefore, possible for a young person to bring a claim of discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, membership of the Traveller community etc. It is not correct to say that the Act excludes young people.</P>
        <P>The Government has amended the Equal Status Act twice to make changes in the way it impacts on young people. It clarified the law in regard to the regulation of access to licensed premises by persons under 18 years of age and the conditions under which it is permissible to set an age limit for the purchase of liquor higher than 18 years. The Government also amended the Equal Status Act to apply it to discrimination on the age ground in the provision of motor vehicle insurance to drivers under 18 years of age. The Government has shown that it is prepared to consider well founded proposals for changes to equality legislation. However a general application of the age ground to persons under 18 would not be practical.</P>
        <P>The role of protection of the rights and interests of children and young people under 18 resides with the Ombudsman for Children established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 and not with the Equal Status Acts. The role of the Ombudsman for Children covers three main areas the first being the promotion of children&rsquo;s rights, the second dealing with complaints and investigations and the third the carrying out of research and inquiries.</P>
        <P>A better approach would be the one already identified in the report which is a focus on the role the media have to play in creating negative stereotyping and its recommendations in this regard to the National Union of Journalists and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. I would imagine that any code of practice for the press could also usefully address this point. The research makes the case that the media have a particular responsibility to take care in their portrayal of groups, such as young people, that have limited influence and power in society. Stereotyping is not something created by legislation and neither would legislation against it have any success in stopping it.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>

	<P><?oasys _ic14- ?>As the Deputy will be aware the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory independent body established under the Refugee Act 1996 in order to deal with negative <Col N="931"/>recommendations in respect of applications for refugee status issued by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The tribunal has been in operation since November 2000 and is comprised, at the present time, of a full-time chairperson and 33 part-time members. The tribunal, its chairperson and members as well as its staff are carrying out important functions for the State in meeting our obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. In this regard, I believe that the chairperson is carrying out his functions in accordance with his statutory and contractual obligations.</P>
        <P>The tribunal has undertaken a significant job of work since its establishment taking some 23,107 decisions up to the end of 2005. It has also been tackling on an ongoing basis the number of appeals on hands and moving from a situation, for example, where on 31 January 2004 it had some 2,596 appeals to clear, some 990 of which were over six months old, to a situation at the end of December 2005 where it had 1,267 appeals on hands only 258 of which were over six months old.</P>
        <P>On 22 November 2005, two members of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal wrote to the chairperson of the tribunal and myself advising of their intention to resign as members with immediate effect and for stated reasons. I do not propose to elaborate on the matters in question because of the potential legal implications arising from the issues raised. However, on receipt of the letters of resignation, I requested a report from the chairperson. In response, the chairperson informed me that he strongly refutes the criticisms in the correspondence and that he has written to the former members on that basis.</P>
        <P>In relation to the issue of transparency surrounding the tribunal&rsquo;s decisions, I would point out that the framework for the transaction of the business of the tribunal is contained in the Refugee Act 1996. Having regard to the independent statutory functions of the members of the tribunal, I am advised by the chairperson that every effort is made, in line with the powers provided in the Refugee Act 1996, to ensure that the business of the tribunal is managed efficiently and effectively and is consistent with fairness and natural justice. In this regard, the chairperson has the power to issue guidelines and guidance notes on the practical application and operation of the 1996 Act and on developments in the law relating to refugees. In addition, the chairperson convenes meetings of members to discuss matters relating to the discharge of the business of the tribunal, including, in particular, such matters as the avoidance of undue divergences in the exercise by members of their functions under the 1996 Act.</P><Col N="932"/>
        <P>One issue which is topical at present in relation to the tribunal is the issue of the publication of its decisions. I am advised by the chairperson that he attaches great importance to this matter. A committee of members is in place which has been researching best international practice and I am advised it has agreed a system of publication which is member intensive. I am further advised that the first selection of decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to be published pursuant to section 19(4A)(<i>a</i>) of the Refugee Act 1996 will be on 31 March 2006.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>

The necessary amendment was effected by section 18 of the Arbitration (International Commercial) Act 1998.

The Director of Public Prosecutions is totally independent in the carrying out of his functions. Where evidence of criminality has been accumulated in any investigation into the activities of criminals, that evidence is presented to the Director of Public Prosecutions who adjudicates as to what action, if any, is to be taken. If a direction is received to charge particular persons the matter is then presented before the courts.</P>
        <P>Deferral of such cases arises only while the matter is processed through the courts where it may be adjourned from time to time until it is disposed of.

	<P>All applications for asylum in the State are processed in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996 and in particular having due regard to the definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in section 2 of that Act, which states that a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; is &ldquo;...a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it&rdquo;. However, this definition does not include a person in respect of whom there are serious grounds for considering has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; has committed a serious non-political crime outside the State prior to his or her arrival in the State; or has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>A person seeking the status of refugee in the State may apply to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under section 8 of the 1996 Act for a declaration to the effect that such a person is a refugee in accordance with the definition as outlined. In respect of each individual asylum seeker, the task is to determine whether, following investigation, he or she is deemed to come within the terms of the refugee definition on the basis of all the information provided and on the basis of comprehensive country of origin information drawn from independent sources, such as the UNHCR. As provided for in the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, this investigation is carried out by two statutorily independent offices: at first instance, by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. It is on the basis of the recommendations of these independent bodies that the Minister decides that he should or should not declare an applicant to be a refugee.</P>
        <P>The issuing of such a declaration by the Minister is governed by section 17 of the 1996 Act which, <i>inter alia</i>, provides that restrictions which would not normally apply to recognised refugees may apply in cases where the Minister considers that it is necessary to do so in the interests of national security and public policy. To date, these restrictions have not been applied to any recognised refugee. For reasons of confidentiality, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with details of persons who arrived here as asylum seekers and have been granted refugee status, having committed criminal offences in the State.</P><Col N="935"/>
        <P>The Deputy might also wish to be aware that section 21 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, sets out the circumstances under which refugee status can be revoked. Section 21(1)(<i>g</i>) of that Act provides that the Minister may revoke a declaration of refugee status where he is satisfied that a person to whom a declaration of refugee status has been given is a person whose presence in the State poses a threat to national security or public policy &mdash;<i>ordre public</i>. Clearly where evidence of a court conviction for criminal activity on the part of a recognised refugee comes to hand, a judgment has to be made as to whether the nature and gravity of the criminal offence is such as would warrant the revocation of that person&rsquo;s status as a refugee.</P>
        <P>The revocation procedure as set out in section 21 of the Act is an elaborate one, involving notification to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and a right of appeal to the High Court. To date, five persons have had their refugee status revoked with two of these revocation decisions being the subject of ongoing legal challenges.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Omagh bomb investigation remains a live police investigation in both Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction. As this is an ongoing police investigation in both jurisdictions, it is a matter primarily for both police forces. My Department does not have a role in the actual investigation, nor would this be appropriate. The general situation regarding the atrocity and the status of the Nally report have been mentioned from time to time in intergovernmental contacts.</P>
        <P>There is ongoing and close cooperation between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda investigation is managed from an incident room at Monaghan Garda station. Regular meetings are still being held between the investigation team based in Monaghan and the PSNI investigation team based in Omagh. Senior officers from both police forces meet from time to time to discuss all aspects of the investigation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Nally group was not mandated to inquire into the Omagh bombing of August 1998 or who the perpetrators of that atrocity were. The Nally report arose when the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, presented a report to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. This report contained allegations by a Garda detective sergeant about the handling of intelligence by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning the activities of the Real IRA, RIRA, in 2002 and about drug-related matters in the period 1995 to 1996. My predecessor as Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, duly appointed Dr. Dermot Nally, former Secretary to the Government, Mr. Joe Brosnan, former Secretary of the Department of Justice, and Mr. Eamonn Barnes, former Director <Col N="937"/>of Public Prosecutions, to examine matters arising from the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report to the Minister. This included allegations relating to the conduct of certain Garda officers in the period immediately before and after the Omagh bombing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Nally group reported in June 2003. The core of the allegations, which would have amounted to serious misconduct on the part of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, were examined in detail and rejected in their entirety. The report has not been published as it contains highly sensitive matters involving the security of the State and possible risk to the lives of individuals. There are also live criminal charges against the person who made the allegations. I have undertaken to publish a redacted version of the report once those criminal charges have been disposed of.</P>

	<P>In July 2004, I commissioned the auctioneering-estate agency review group to examine the licensing and regulatory requirements for property practitioners going forward. I initiated the review against a background of a considerable level of public concern about specific selling practices in the property industry, apparent deficiencies in regulatory and supervisory arrangements in respect of service providers and the need to take account of new forms of property services. The review group comprised representatives of the auctioneering profession, consumers, the Competition Authority, the Law Society, the farming sector, the co-operatives sector and Departments.</P>
        <P>I published the resulting report in October 2005 and, at the same time, I announced that the Government had approved one of its key recommendations, the establishment of the national property services regulatory authority. A further key recommendation is that the new authority should assume responsibility for the licensing and regulation of all trading entities providing auctioneering, estate agency, property letting and property management services.</P>
        <P>Property management agencies are not currently regulated. The report recommends a specific class of licence for these agencies, that they contribute to an approved fidelity fund to protect client moneys and that they are made subject to oversight by the authority and to its vetting and complaints procedures.</P>
        <P>The formal establishment of the new authority will have to await the enactment of the necessary legislation, which is in preparation at present. <Col N="938"/>However, an implementation group is in place and working to assist and advise on preparations for the new authority including the recruitment of a director &mdash; advertised last week in national newspapers &mdash; the establishment of a headquarters in Navan, identification of staffing and training requirements, and advance planning of operational matters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The study to which the question refers is the Economic Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases in the Enlarged EU by J. Leal, R. Luengo-Fern&aacute;ndez, A. Gray, S. Petersen and M. Rayner, published in the <i>Euro<Col N="941"/>pean Heart Journal</i>, doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehi733. I understand that the authors set out to provide an estimate of the economic costs of cardiovascular disease for EU countries. Data were obtained from published studies of health care costs and health service utilisation. It appears that all costs for health care in Ireland were extrapolated from costs in other countries. It is unclear how some of costs were estimated, for example, annual loss of earnings or the cost for a day&rsquo;s inpatient care. The data on costs and resource implications were used to estimate the costs of cardiovascular disease.</P>
        <P>Given that the authors may have underestimated the true costs in Ireland, there are question marks about the accuracy of the overall findings as they relate to this country. It is also possible that the authors did not include the costs of services provided in the private sector.</P>
        <P>There has been rapid expansion in cardiology services in Ireland in recent years. The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, was launched in 1999. The report makes recommendations about the prevention, treatment and surveillance of coronary heart disease across a number of sectors and the full range of health service activities, in health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, acute hospital services and cardiac rehabilitation. Since 2000 the Government has committed over &euro;60 million towards the implementation of the strategy. This funding has supported a wide range of new regional services and initiatives, which have had a measurable impact on the diagnosis, and treatment of patients with heart disease. More than 800 new posts have been created, including 19 additional consultant cardiology posts.</P>
        <P>We have made progress in addressing the key challenges in the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy in relation to, first, improving population health by supporting intersectoral work for health promotion, to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and improve quality of life, second, ensuring equitable access to services by continued provision of resources and support to fully implement outstanding cardiovascular health strategy recommendations to meet the needs of the growing numbers of older people and to provide new treatments for which there is evidence of effectiveness and, third, improving the quality of services by developing and implementing practice guidelines, the implementation of cardiovascular health information systems, support for clinical audit and for research to enhance the quality of services.</P>
        <P>It appears that the study may not reflect the current level of expenditure and service provision. The study is useful however in drawing to our attention the high costs of cardiovascular disease both in Ireland and at European level, not just the costs of health care but also the costs to the economy and to families and carers. The Health Service Executive, in conjunction with my <Col N="942"/>Department, proposes to commence a review of the cardiovascular health strategy very shortly. The outcome of this review will inform future policy in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 79 together.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the working group on alcohol established under the special initiative of Sustaining Progress are as follows. The working group will develop a programme of action taking account in particular of the work of the strategic taskforce on alcohol. It will also seek to identify potential synergies between the responses to alcohol and drug misuse, taking account of the outcome of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>In the first phase, the working group will seek to agree a programme of actions which can deliver targeted results on under-age drinking, binge drinking and drink driving. This should include specific targets, timeframes, resources and allocation of responsibilities. In this regard, the working group will examine the potential for the social partners to commit to specific actions as part of the overall approach. The working group will make a progress report to the steering group of Sustaining Progress by October 2005. It will also make proposals on its future work agenda.</P>
        <P>Taking account of its terms of reference, the group agreed to consider the three areas of high risk drinking, under-age drinking and drink driving. The group reported at the end of 2005 and <Col N="943"/>the issue of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders was not specifically considered. However, it is expected that the group to consider the issue of labelling, referred to in Question No. 268 of 31 January 2006, will be established this year and that all relevant stakeholders will be given an opportunity to contribute to the process.</P>

        <P>The working group on alcohol was established under the special initiative on tackling alcohol and drug misuse in Sustaining Progress to help mobilise the stakeholders through social partnership to achieve a targeted and measurable reduction in alcohol misuse. While the original membership of the working group was as follows, some changes in the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s representation will be necessary following the restructuring of the Department, for any future work programme: Mr. Peter Cassells, chair; Mr. Chris Fitzgerald, Department of Health and Children; Mr. John Weafer, Department of Transport; Mr. Declan Hayes, Department of Transport; Ms Carmel Madden, national drugs strategy team; chief superintendent Gerry Blake, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; sergeant Orla Black, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Dr. Ann Hope, national alcohol policy adviser, Department of Health and Children; Ms Tracy O&rsquo;Keeffe, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Dr. Declan Bedford, Health Service Executive; Mr. Se&aacute;n Mackell, Irish Congress of Trade Unions; Dr. Joe Barry, Irish Congress of Trade Unions; Ms Rosemary Garth, IBEC; Mr. Michael Patten, IBEC; Mr. Michael Conroy, Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; Mr. John Moloney, Department of Education and Science; Mr. Colm Markey, Macra na Feirme; Ms Mary Cunningham, National Youth Council of Ireland; Ms Norah Gibbons, Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance; Mr. John Shaw, Department of the Taoiseach; and Ms <Col N="944"/>Elaine Kelly, Department of the Taoiseach. Mr. Michael Patten is director of corporate affairs at Diageo Ireland and Ms Rosemary Garth is director of drinks, Food and Drinks Industry Ireland.</P>
        <P>The group concentrated, in accordance with the terms of reference, on the potential for effectively mobilising State, social partner and other organisations around a programme of actions which would contribute to a reduction in alcohol related problems. The group stated that its report &ldquo;complements the work of the strategic task force on alcohol&rdquo; and &ldquo;must be viewed as building on the reports of the STFA and not as a replacement to them&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The annual organ donor awareness campaign, which is organised by the Irish donor network and administered by the Irish Kidney Association, highlights the necessity for organ donation generally. The campaign, which is supported by my Department, highlights the need for organ donors by promoting the carrying of an organ donor card.</P>
        <P>My Department has been providing financial support to the donor awareness campaign for a number of years. The grant in 2005 amounted to &euro;500,000.</P>
        <P>There are two systems that can be used to ascertain an individual&rsquo;s wishes on organ donation: the opt-in system and the opt-out system. The former system, which operates in this country, requires that the specific consent to donation of each person, or their relatives, be obtained before organs or tissues are removed. The opt-out system presumes that all citizens consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary.</P>
        <P>The practice in this country is that, even when a person has indicated his or her willingness to donate organs by way of carrying an organ donor card, or a driving licence marked accordingly, the consent of the next-of-kin is always sought.</P>
        <P>Even where opt-out systems are in operation, relatives of the deceased are approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour. Thus, relatives will always be aware that a donation is being considered and can register an objection to the donation.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is currently considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union and it is expected that this report will inform decisions regarding the development of a legislative framework in this area.</P>
        <P>In the context of increasing the number of donor organs available for transplant, the Health Service Executive was asked by the Department to undertake a review and analysis of the factors that impact on organ procurement and retrieval rates in hospitals around the country. This review has commenced.</P>

The position for the PEACE and technical assistance OPs will be close to their target levels of expenditure for both regions at the end of 2006. The regional programmes and the productive sector OP are unlikely to achieve their end 2006 targets, particularly for those measures that are not co-funded by the Structural Funds. The Deputy should note that expenditure on the EU co-financed measures under the operational programmes will continue until the end of 2008 and will need to be considered in determining progress.</P>

These include stamp duty reliefs for first time buyers and mortgage interest relief, as well as the reliefs available to investors or owner occupiers under the property-based incentive schemes. Any additional construction costs associated with the installation of environmentally friendly systems when building a new home would, of course, be reflected in the value of the reliefs to the taxpayers concerned. However, I have no plans to introduce specific tax reliefs in respect of such systems.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A person who holds a credit card account with a credit card provider pays stamp duty on that credit card account once for each 12-month period ending on 1 April each year. Where a person cancels a credit card account within a 12-month period, he or she pays the charge at the time of cancellation. This means that, in respect of any credit card account, an individual will only pay once for the year ending on the following 1 April. Where the individual closes a credit card after 1 April in any year, a stamp duty charge of &euro;40 will arise as the account has been maintained by the financial institution during the year ending on the following 1 April. This is consistent with applying a stamp duty charge for a year or part of a year for which the credit card account is held.</P>
        <P>Section 128 of the Finance Act 2005 contained measures to eliminate a double stamp duty charge for the same year on the switching of financial cards. If an individual switches accounts after 2 April 2005, he or she will pay the stamp duty to old bank or card issuer on closing the account. This will be requested in the final statement. The old bank or card issuer will then issue the individual with a letter of closure. This letter will confirm that the stamp duty has been paid for the period in question. This should be presented to the new bank or card issuer to ensure that a further charge is not made. An individual may switch his or her account as often as he or she likes and will still only be charged tax <Col N="956"/>on the original account, provided he or she obtains this letter of closure each time the account is closed. The second and subsequent bank or card issuer will issue a letter of closure once it has proof that the duty has been paid on the first account. If he or she remains concerned about his or her treatment, the person concerned could contact the Financial Services Ombudsman or the Financial Regulator.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to replies he received to previous questions on this matter. In particular, I would draw his attention to Questions Nos. 354 and 355 dated 2 November 2005, Question No. 147 on 7 February 2006, together with my reply to Question No. 110 of 28 February 2006.</P>
        <P>The role of my Department is to assist in achieving the Government&rsquo;s priorities, including those priorities designed to address the issue of job creation in areas such as north Mayo. As indicated in my previous reply, progress is being made in prioritising expenditure under the national development plan in the BMW region and the indications are that the underspend on a number of key infrastructure measures under both the economic and social infrastructure OP and the BMW regional OP is being addressed.</P>
        <P>There is evidence to suggest that good progress is being made in achieving the objectives of the current NDP in the west region. Data published by the CSO suggest that the levels of total income per person in the west region grew from &euro;14,420 to &euro;18,487 between years 1999 and 2002 or 89.1% to 90.3% of the State level for those years. With respect to employment, growth in the number at work in the west region to the fourth quarter of 2005 is strong, with an increase of some 33,600 since the fourth quarter of 1999. The rate of unemployment in the region has fallen from 4.6% to 4.3% over the same period.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has already outlined the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting job creation in north Mayo. A significant number of infrastructural projects are currently being developed or are planned for County Mayo <Col N="957"/>and north Mayo in particular. These include plans by the IDA to acquire land in Ballina for the development of a high quality business and technology park.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no special exemptions from stamp duty in respect of the purchase of a second-hand house in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy. In the case of the purchase of a second-hand house by a first time purchaser, there is an exempt threshold of &euro;317,500 and reduced rates up to &euro;635,000. A person who previously, either individually or jointly, purchased or received a gift of a house, or of any part of a house, would not be regarded as a first time purchaser. The fact that the house had been disposed of at the time of a subsequent purchase is not a factor in deciding whether the first time purchaser relief applies. I have no plans to alter this situation. However, as the Deputy may be aware, stamp duty does not arise on most new houses.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will be visiting Australia for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day, visiting the cities of Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane. The Australian market is extremely important to Ireland due to its substantial industry and consumer base. In recent years, significant inroads have been made into the Australian market by indigenous Irish software companies. Overall trade figures have also increased, with exports from Ireland to Australia valued at over 1 billion Australian dollars in 2005.</P>
        <P>Australia&rsquo;s exchanges with the Asian economies have increased substantially in recent times and many Irish companies see the advantage of using Australia as a regional &ldquo;trading post&rdquo;. To enhance the Government&rsquo;s Asia strategy across the wide range of functions I will be attending, I plan to maximise the unique promotional opportunities offered by my visit to deal with issues of mutual interest.</P><Col N="958"/>
        <P>Australia is an increasingly important market for the Irish tourism sector. In 2005, an estimated 150,000 Australian visitors came to Ireland. It is only right that we make every effort to further increase the number of Australian visitors to Ireland and this is a useful opportunity to market Ireland as a tourist destination, as well as enhancing the attractiveness of Ireland as a market for inward investment across a range of sectors.</P>
        <P>During my official visit to the three locations, I will attend a number of business lunches organised by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, and Tourism Ireland where I will meet, among others, senior executives from Australian financial services companies that have established operations in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will focus on promoting Ireland as a &ldquo;knowledge economy&rdquo;. Ideas and knowledge have transformed Irish business and industry. Our continued economic development is dependent on further enhancing our position in the globally competitive market for knowledge-driven investment and innovation. Our success in this area is already evidenced by the growing international profile of top level Irish scientists and entrepreneurs and my St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit provides an invaluable opportunity to reinforce this message. St Patrick&rsquo;s Day is equally an important occasion for enhancing our links with Irish communities abroad to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the valuable work of Irish community and friendship groups. I will also visit, the Lansdowne Club in Sydney, the Queensland Irish Association, Maquarie University in Sydney, the city authorities in Sydney, the Irish Consulate in Sydney and the Irish Embassy in Canberra. In addition, I will be meeting separately with the Irish Australian Welfare Bureau and the Irish Parliamentary Friendship Group, which includes the New South Wales Minister for Finance. I also hope to meet the Australian Federal Treasurer.</P>

It received a further request for a P21 for the same year on 13 February 2006 and a duplicate will shortly issue together with a form P21 for the year 2005.</P>

	<P>The National Salmon Commission met on 27 February 2006 to give final consideration to the conservation measures for both the commercial and angling sectors for the 2006-07 fishing season. The chairman submitted the <Col N="1011"/>report of the commission to me by letter of 28 February 2006. He has advised that the advice and recommendations of the commission is based on a majority decision arising from a vote of nine in favour, eight against and two abstentions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my intention to publish the recommendations of the National Salmon Commission, together with the advice I have received from the standing scientific committee of the commission and the advice tendered by the fisheries managers, in the coming weeks when I publish my proposed amendments to the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme. This will afford all interested parties an opportunity to consider the advices prior to the introduction of the regulations in April 2006.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the views of the chairpersons of the regional fisheries board were passed to this Department in mid-February. I am currently considering the views expressed in this correspondence and hope to be in a position to respond in the not too distant future.</P>
        <P>The current intention is to implement phase one and the Government has authorised the drafting of a Bill to establish the new national inland fisheries authority and regional advisory boards. The Department is working in close consultation with the national fisheries management executive in designing this new legislation and it is hoped to have it enacted this year. Publication will be dependent on the complexity of the legislation required and competing priorities on the Oireachtas&rsquo;s legislative programme for 2006. The Government also decided that the consultants should be re-engaged in 2006 to identify in more detail the structures, resources, funding and policy approaches needed to implement the further restructuring of the sector. This process will involve full, transparent, comprehensive and patient consultations with all of the stakeholders during which the principles and structures to deliver the new model will be fleshed out.</P>
        <P>It is my firm belief that the policy adopted will allow the sector to reach its full potential through more coherent and consistent policy making and resource allocation and use and will give the whole range of stakeholders the opportunity to be central to the development, promotion and protection of the inland fisheries resource.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The licensing authority for sea fishing boats has informed me that sea fishing boat licences that permit the fishing for razor clams are not area or fishing method specific and that all licensed and registered vessels in the polyvalent general and specific segments are entitled to fish for this species and many others.</P>
        <P>As part of the work of the molluscan species advisory group, established under the shellfish management framework and which includes a representative of the razor clam fishermen, a razor clam local advisory committee is to be established in the near future. This will be facilitated by BIM and will seek to develop a sustainable management framework for the fishery.</P>
        <P>Harvesting of razor shells is subject to legislative controls and the areas in which such harvesting can take place is classified by ministerial regulations every six months following consideration of the results of an ongoing sampling programme. A system of gatherers dockets is also implemented whereby important information is collected on the fishery in such aspects as the precise location and date of harvesting, the quantities involved and the destination of the harvested razor shells. I also wish to inform the Deputy that the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate staff carries out periodic inspections of fishing activity in this area to ensure that harvesting activities are being undertaken in accordance with the prevailing regulations.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>To date, the Government has consistently ruled out buy-out as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks. Instead, it has, since 2002, promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling as the best instrument available to achieve catch reductions.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has advised that any compensatory schemes should <Col N="1014"/>largely be funded by those stakeholders who would be the main economic beneficiaries of more salmon being free to return to the rivers. I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the committee&rsquo;s comment that &ldquo;public moneys spent must have, as a primary aim, ensuring the survival of the salmon species and that this precept must be regarded as more important than any economic gain to any sector that may accrue&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is clear that future policy must be designed to ensure the survival of the species, while balancing the interests of various stakeholders in regard to the quantum of catch that appears to be possible within the independent scientific advice and taking account of the detail of that advice in respect of location and types of fishing. I sound a note of caution, however, about any possible scheme designed to address the financial hardship associated with compliance with the scientific advice. I am advised there is no legal requirement to introduce any compensation scheme in the event of a curtailment of fishing effort on conservation grounds in accordance with the Fisheries Acts. In that context, expectations of high levels of monetary compensation are unrealistic. Similarly, and in consideration of equity in the matter, some meaningful contribution would be expected from the economic beneficiaries of a reduction in commercial fishing, whether that is delivered in cash or in kind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On 1 March 2006, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr. Terry Davis, published a report containing his preliminary analysis &mdash; as distinct from specific recommendations &mdash; of the 46 replies he received from member states in <Col N="1015"/>response to his questionnaire on the possible occurrence of the &ldquo;unacknowledged deprivation of liberty&rdquo; in those states. The Government&rsquo;s reply to this questionnaire was made public following its submission on 20 February 2006, and is available on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs, at <i>www.dfa.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>I have already welcomed publication of the Secretary General&rsquo;s analysis. From an Irish perspective, it is particularly satisfying that ours was one of a minority of only 13 replies he adjudged to be sufficiently comprehensive not to require additional clarification. This report makes clear that Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the issues involved is very much in line with that of other states.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General has identified in general terms some issues which he believes require further attention but, as I have indicated above, has made no particular recommendations. He has, however, indicated that he intends to make more specific proposals to the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Committee of Ministers in due course. In conjunction with our partners, the Government awaits these proposals and will examine them carefully once they are made.</P>

	<P>There are a number of protocols which are followed in relation to State and official visits to Ireland by foreign Heads of State. However, it should be noted that President Bush was not in Ireland on a State or official visit. As I have said in reply to a question earlier in the week, permission for President Bush&rsquo;s aircraft to land was granted by my Department in accordance with the normal procedures.</P>
        <P>President Bush&rsquo;s meeting with US military personnel at the airport appears to have been a spontaneous act. Such personnel were, of course, in transit as part of a multinational force authorised by the United Nations Security Council. Permission for this meeting was not required.</P>

	<P>My programme is being finalised. However, I will <Col N="1016"/>represent the Government at promotional St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events in Dallas before accompanying the Taoiseach to Washington for the traditional ceremonies at the White House and on Capitol Hill. This special opportunity, unique to Ireland, for direct and detailed dialogue with the President of the United States and his Administration, and also key players on Capitol Hill, is exceptionally valued by the Government. I expect that the discussions will cover some key international issues, as well as bilateral issues of mutual interest such as the peace process and immigration reform.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the opportunity to promote Ireland in Texas during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period. My programme includes attendance at Irish community events, an American Ireland Fund breakfast and the Dallas St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade. In addition, I will have the opportunity to meet with senior business representatives and address a lunch event hosted by the Dallas Chamber of Commerce.</P>

        <Quest>if he will use this Government&rsquo;s good offices with the US Administration to encourage the US to approve the draft resolution for a new United Nations human rights council presented by the president of the General Assembly on 23 February 2006.</Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the negotiations on the draft resolution establishing the human rights council are still ongoing in New York. The European Union has issued a statement on the text indicating that the draft resolution is acceptable to the Union, even if it does not contain all that we had hoped for. The statement also supports the President of the General Assembly&rsquo;s efforts to secure the broadest possible backing for the early establishment of the human rights council. Ireland played an active role at an EU level in securing support for the text.</P>
        <P>The United States has indicated that it wishes to see certain changes to the draft resolution before it can support it. While the EU understands the thinking of the United States, we have grave doubts about whether such changes are achievable. Against that background, there have been ongoing discussions between the European Union and the United States both in Washington and in New York to see if the United States might be prepared to modify its position.</P>
        <P>A human rights council established on the basis of this draft resolution would represent a marked improvement on the current Commission on Human Rights. In addition to important new elements, positive features of the Commission on Human Rights &mdash; such as effective access for civil society and the network of special procedures &mdash; would be maintained.</P><Col N="1017"/>
        <P>In light of this, Ireland is committed to supporting the text produced by the President of the General Assembly and will continue to work for its early adoption. I will take advantage of any opportunity which may arise during my visit to the United States next week to set out our position.</P>

        <P>In pursuit of this priority, the coming St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period provides a particularly valuable opportunity for the Taoiseach and myself to discuss all aspects of the situation with the President, with his Administration and with leading figures in Congress, and to seek to advance the agenda in every way possible. However, and as Deputies from different sides of the House will have learned at first hand from visits to Washington, the question of an amnesty is simply not on the legislative agenda in Congress at this time.</P>

The programme for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period in Washington for the Taoiseach and myself is now being finalised. We both would hope to meet the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, which is actively representing the interests of the undocumented, during our visit.</P>
        <P>In my reply of 28 February to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I emphasised that a particular priority of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s and my visit to Washington over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period would be to convey to President Bush and his Administration, and to key players in Congress, the Government&rsquo;s strong support for measures to address the position of our undocumented. I am certain that our undocumented citizens would share this priority.</P>
        <P>I am, as I likewise conveyed in my reply of 28 February, acutely aware of the concerns of the undocumented, not least from my own visits to the United States. These concerns are also conveyed through regular reports from the embassy and consulates, including of meetings with the <Col N="1018"/>Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR. I have been very happy to make a grant of &euro;30,000 available to the ILIR, which is actively representing the interests of our undocumented.</P>
        <P>I very much hope to meet personally with the ILIR during my visit to Washington. In addition to my earlier reply, I take it that this envisaged meeting with the ILIR subsumes the sense of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>

	<P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day has traditionally signalled the start of the tourism season in Ireland. With the international tourism marketplace becoming increasingly competitive and as a result of continuing global uncertainty, 2006 will prove to be another challenging year for Irish tourism and we will need to avail of all opportunities offered to us to build on the successes of recent years. The international celebration of St. Patrick is a unique opportunity to ensure that Ireland is presented as a top class tourist destination to a wide and receptive audience. The key message in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing programme this year is &ldquo;Discover your very own Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This year, the Government will be represented in most of our key tourism markets and other countries with potential for future growth. In that context, I have urged all Government representatives to use any opportunity available during the course of their visits to promote tourism to the island of Ireland. Towards this aim, I have provided all Ministers travelling with comprehensive briefing packs on tourism, including speaking points and relevant background material on the specific markets they are visiting, which will <Col N="1020"/>enable them to exploit the tourism promotional opportunities these visits inevitably present.</P>
        <P>For my part, I will travel to Britain &mdash; our largest tourism market. In Manchester, I will attend the Council of Irish County Associations&rsquo; dinner and other traditional St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events in the city, including Mass at the Irish World Heritage Centre and the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade.</P>

	<P>Under consumer legislation the application of a description to a product as to its place of manufacture, production, processing, etc., is called a trade description under section 2 (1)(<i>b</i>) of the Consumer Information Act 1978. It is an offence to apply a false trade description to a product. However, there is no compulsion on suppliers to provide information on the origin of their products.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission, however, published a draft Council regulation in December 2005 proposing the introduction of an origin marking regime to be introduced for certain specific products including textiles, clothing and shoes coming from outside the EU.

	<P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities <Col N="1021"/>and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Luas, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
        <P>The most recent development in the free travel scheme relates to the time restrictions which have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. From next Monday the morning restriction on free travel will be reduced by 45 minutes &mdash; 9.45 a.m. to 9.00 a.m. as the start of reform in this area. Time restrictions do not apply on any transport services in the case of people with learning disabilities, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other people with disabilities or visual impairment. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times. There are no peak time travel restrictions on Luas, DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses. In addition, many of the households concerned qualify for electricity or gas allowances. Some 264,400 customers &mdash; 145,800 with basic fuel allowance and 118,600 with smokeless fuel supplement &mdash; will benefit in 2006 at an estimated cost of &euro;125.1 million.</P>
        <P>Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of &euro;5.00 from &euro;9.00 to &euro;14.00, &euro;17.90 in designated smokeless areas. This is an increase of between 38% and 55%. The <Col N="1022"/>scheme has been improved in recent budgets. The means test has been eased and the duration of payment increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks.</P>
        <P>In addition to the fuel allowance, over 320,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of &euro;109 million in 2005. As currently structured, these allowances are linked to unit energy consumption, so that these people are protected against unit price increases in electricity or gas.</P>
        <P>There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs. If a person has an exceptional heating cost by virtue of a particular infirmity or medical condition which he or she is unable to meet out of household income, it is open to him or her to apply to the local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is not intended to meet ongoing fuel costs or storage heater costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government administers a scheme of special housing aid for the elderly. The scope of this scheme includes the provision of suitable heating systems. Applications for this special housing aid can be made through the community care department of the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>Diet supplements are provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Any person who is receiving a social welfare or health service executive payment, who has been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and who is unable to provide for his or her food needs from within his or her own resources, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2004 the diet supplement scheme was restructured to take account of increases in both social welfare payment rates and the rate of food inflation since 1996.</P>
        <P>In the case of new applicants for diet supplement the amount of supplement payable is based on increased up-to-date diet costs, &euro;44 for lower cost diets or &euro;57 for higher cost diets, less one third of the applicant&rsquo;s income or one sixth of the joint income in the case of a couple. The assessment of individual entitlements takes <Col N="1023"/>account of the annual increases in primary social welfare rates since 2004.</P>
        <P>As diet supplements are subject to a means test, the amount payable in any individual case depends on the applicant&rsquo;s income and other aspects of the household&rsquo;s circumstances as well on the type of diet that has been prescribed. For example, in the case of a single person on disability allowance with no other income, who has been prescribed a high cost diet, the amount payable at present is &euro;12.07 per week. The most typical payments are in the range &euro;5.00 to &euro;7.99 per week which account for 42.5% of all payments.</P>
        <P>Because increases in the social welfare payment rates were higher than food price inflation since 1996, the shortfall to be met by the diet supplement is less than it was in the past. However, as a special arrangement, people who were in receipt of a diet supplement prior to the introduction of the revised regulations on 1 January 2004 continue to receive their existing rate of supplement until such time as there is a change in their circumstances that would warrant a review of their cases.</P>
        <P>In order to inform a re-appraisal of the scheme, my Department commissioned a study by an expert from the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute.</P>
        <P>The study examined the special diets prescribed in legislation for which assistance is available through the existing diet supplement scheme. The study also considered the appropriate level of assistance required to cater for any additional costs involved in providing for necessary special diets, relative to the cost of a normal healthy eating diet. This report was formally presented to me in January 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department is finalising a revised scheme which will take account of the findings and recommendations of the study and I would hope to be in a position in the near future to introduce regulations to provide for this. Pending finalisation of the revised scheme, diet supplements continue to be provided for existing recipients and new applicants as heretofore.</P>

        <P Just="Left">A table showing the number of customers who made an application for unemployment assistance in 2005 together with those who were disallowed as not genuinely seeking work is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>A deciding officer will take a number of factors into account in deciding whether a customer is genuinely seeking work. Any steps that a person has taken to secure employment will be taken into consideration, provided they offer a reasonable chance of the person getting employment. The steps that are expected to be taken, to seek work will vary from person to person and seasonal factors may also be a consideration. In determining what are reasonable steps, the deciding officer considers the nature and conditions of the employment sought and the individual circumstances of the persons concerned, including their level of skills and-or qualifications for the employment in question having regard to the state of the labour market and existing labour market opportunities.</P>
        <P>Any person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is genuinely seeking work is not entitled to an unemployment payment. Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer he or she may appeal this decision to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>The details requested by the Deputy have been compiled from data that is maintained on a local office catchment area basis and these do not correspond exactly with county boundaries. </P>

        <P>The powers to determine the locations for the provision of bus stops is vested in the Garda Commissioner under section 85 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. Under that section, the Commissioner may issue a direction to a bus operator identifying the specific location of bus stops and termini in respect of any bus route and, in that context, may determine that certain stops may only be used for passengers boarding or leaving buses. I understand the Garda engages in a consultation process with both the local authority and the bus service provider before issuing a direction under section 85. The NRA, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus are aware of these statutory provisions.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for Kinsale Harbour has transferred from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the Department of Transport with effect from 1 January 2006.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement, which was launched in January 2005, states that the continued operation of many of the regional harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance. The policy statement reiterated the view that these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership or, where this is not possible, sale to the private sector would be considered. In harbours where significant commercial traffic exists consideration will be given to bringing them under the control of a port company.</P>
        <P>The Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to advance the implementation of the ports policy statement with regard to the transfer of the designated regional harbours to their respective local authorities, where appropriate, and to proceed individually in conjunction with the relevant local authorities and harbour authorities, having regard to local requirements in each case.</P>
        <P>Kinsale Harbour is a candidate for transfer to local authority control. As the harbour is situated in the functional area of Cork County Council, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government requested the council to undertake an overall assessment of the potential of the harbour for transfer. This report has been received and is currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>Adams Quay is a fishery facility within Kinsale Harbour. The question of any funding for the development of Adams Quay would be a matter <Col N="1028"/>for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, through the fishery harbour development programme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Transport has adopted a set of guiding principles on integrated transport which inform its approach to policy and project developments across the Department. The guiding principles are set out in the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2005-07.</P>
        <P>There is also a major emphasis on integration in the Transport 21 investment programme. There is a particular focus on the development of an integrated multi-modal public transport system in the greater Dublin area, with attention being paid to the various facets of integration, including service integration, interchange, park and ride, ticketing and information.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific projects to which the Deputy refers, Bus &Eacute;ireann is particularly conscious of timetabling its services to link to rail services and to provide integrated services across the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The approval of bus stops is a matter for local authorities who consult with operators and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the achievement of integration as far as possible at the local level is one of the considerations taken into account.</P>
        <P>There is a significant degree of integration of ticketing at the present time. Integrated tickets are available for transfer between Luas, Dublin <Col N="1030"/>Bus and Irish Rail services and between Luas and some private operators. Separately, an integrated ticketing scheme using smart technology is being developed.</P>
        <P>As we move more and more towards a multi-modal and multi-operator transport system, and developing legislation in that regard, I will be reviewing the extent to which current legal provisions support integration in such an environment. In this context, my mandate to the Dublin Transportation Authority establishment team asked it, when considering the remit of the proposed authority, to have regard to the delivery of an integrated system for the greater Dublin area. I expect to receive the team&rsquo;s report shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 913 on 25 January 2006 relating to Exchequer funding for vulnerable Irish communities abroad.</P>
        <P>Under the Dormant Accounts Acts 2001 to 2005, information regarding those who opened accounts that have been deemed dormant accounts is maintained by the relevant financial institutions so that funds can be repatriated to these persons or their successors where possible.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for Government to decide how moneys in the dormant accounts fund are to be disbursed in pursuit of broad objectives, and in accordance with procedures, as laid down in the legislation. The legislation does not specify that the address or status of the original account holders should be taken into account as criteria for disbursal. Accordingly, no estimate of the nature referred to by the Deputy has been made and there are no plans at present to do so.</P>

	<P>I will be travelling to New Zealand for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festivities. I will visit Auckland, Wellington, Tauranga and <Col N="1031"/>Christchurch, and my visit will focus on developing links with Irish community groups. I will participate in traditional St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events, including the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival parade and banquet in Auckland. I will also attend the Wellington Irish Society dinner and Hutt Valley Irish Society supper.</P>
        <P>New Zealand is a small economy but, like Ireland&rsquo;s, one of the most open economies in the world. There is great potential to enhance economic ties between Ireland and New Zealand. Total trade with New Zealand in 2004 was valued at approximately &euro;83 million. The year 2004 witnessed a 34% increase on the 2003 figures for visitors from New Zealand to Ireland, and there will be a significant economic and tourism focus to many of the events I will attend. I will also be looking at developments in rural tourism, as New Zealand is regarded as one of the premier destinations in this regard, as well as touching on New Zealand strategies in support of their minority language.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application under the single payment scheme on 12 May 2005. He also included an application to consolidate his entitlements under the scheme. Following an initial examination of the consolidation application, it was noted that the person named declared 4.60 hectares of potatoes on his 2005 single payment application. In accordance with Article 51 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003, lands used for the production of potatoes and-or fruit-vegetables declared by applicants under the single payment scheme are not eligible to benefit from payment but these hectares must be included in the number of consolidated entitlements established for the applicant. My Department issued a letter to the person named on 7 March 2006 outlining the position and requesting that he indicate whether he wished to proceed or withdraw his consolidation application. Upon receipt of a reply from the person named, my Department will be in a position to complete processing of his application and arrange for payment to issue.</P>

I will also participate in a number of Bord Bia sponsored events to market Irish products in the growing Czech market, including an in-store promotion, media presentation and a business lunch for key Czech agents and distributors. I will be guest of honour at the Czech-Irish Business Association St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day annual dinner on Saturday, 18 March. On Sunday, I will attend a St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day mass for members of the Irish community. In addition, I will hold bilateral talks with the Czech Minister for Agriculture on a range of issues, including WTO and CAP policy as well as with local authorities on matters of mutual interest. Irish exports to the Czech Republic grew by over 10% in 2004 and showed a year-on-year expansion of over 24% in the first half of 2005. There are already approximately 50 Irish companies operating in the Czech Republic.</P>

All of the land was deemed to be owned by the herdowner. The statement of provisional entitlements, which issued to all farmers in 2004, provided for a review of the calculation of the entitlements, where the person concerned considered that the calculation did not accurately reflect the farming activity during the reference period. No such request was received from the person named.</P>

Within a relatively short space of time, the numbers requiring accommodation have reduced and it is incumbent on the RIA to use the accommodation at its disposal in the most effective way and to provide the best value for money for the Department and the taxpayer. In addition to the exodus of families with IBC from RIA accommodation, the numbers and profile of persons seeking asylum have changed. The number of families seeking asylum in the State has dropped and RIA accommodation must reflect this reality. In order to address the reduction in numbers and the change in profile, the RIA embarked on a programme of downsizing of its accommodation portfolio. This is intended to bring supply and demand into balance and will include the re-classification of some of the accommodation centres in order to optimise usage and obtain value for money. This downsizing has included the closure of 15 centres with a combined capacity of 833 beds during 2005. To date in 2006, four centres with a combined capacity of approximately 270 beds have been closed and further closures and re-classifications are planned. Overall, the current downsizing has led to the closure of two accommodation centres in County Mayo. There are now only two centres remaining in County Mayo, one of which is in Kiltimagh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of the centre in Kiltimagh, the RIA considered it to be suitable for possible re-classification from family to single person accommodation. As part of the reclassification of this centre, the RIA intended to relocate its families to other centres where they could benefit from special facilities for children and young people including pre-school facilities. For a number of reasons, the RIA has agreed that the families with school-going children who currently reside at the centre will be allowed to remain there at least until the end of the current school year.</P>
        <P>The centre consists of two buildings, the Railway Hotel and the annex, which is located across the road. The RIA has recently allocated nine single males to this building and a number of further placements will be made this week. Dis<Col N="1039"/>cussions have taken place with various groups such as Irish Rural Development, Le Ch&eacute;ile Support Group, Intercultural Ireland, Castlebar, and St. Aidan&rsquo;s National School and we understand that there is now a greater understanding of the proposed new arrangements and the reasons for these changes.</P>
        <P>The RIA understands the degree of anxiety or unease that a local population may feel if a centre profile is changed from women, children and small babies to single persons. It is the RIA&rsquo;s experience that such feelings dissipate as the local population comes to know the individuals concerned and their practical experience of the centre operation allays their initial concerns. The RIA currently has in its accommodation portfolio 16 male only centres and no significant issues have arisen at these locations. In addition, the RIA has embarked on the re-classification of a portion of some of its larger family centres in order to accommodate single persons alongside families in counties Sligo, Meath and Monaghan.</P>

	<P>As part of the preparation for the Garda recruitment campaign in 2004, I asked the Garda Commissioner to review the eligibility <Col N="1040"/>criteria for entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in so far as it related to the maximum age of entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This arose from the need to implement Directive 2000/78/EC, which, <i>inter alia</i>, prohibits discrimination in employment on the grounds of age.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In November 2004, on foot of recommendations from the Garda Commissioner on the matter, I increased the upper age limit for entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from 26 to 35. This important change has extended the opportunity to many more people of a career in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and increases the pool of talent available to the force on an ongoing basis. The change has already had a beneficial effect, with a significant percentage of recent recruits coming within the extended age range. There are no plans to make any further amendments to the age limit at this time.</P>

	<P>Entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988, as amended. In September 2004, I obtained Government approval to make certain changes to the criteria set out in these regulations. These changes will open up entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to persons in Ireland from all parts of the community and from all ethnic backgrounds. This is significant step will help to ensure that future intakes of recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reflect the composition of Irish society to the benefit of the force and the people it serves.</P>
        <P>To be eligible for selection as a trainee, an applicant must be of good character; be certified by a registered medical practitioner nominated by the Commissioner after consultation with the Minister to be of good health, of sound constitution and fitted physically and mentally to perform the duties of a member of the service; have passed a physical competence test; be at least 18 and under 35 years on the first day of the month in which the competition was advertised; and be a national of a European Union member state, a European Economic Area state or the Swiss Confederation, be a refugee under the Refugee Act 1996, or have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the first day of the month in which the advertisement for the Garda recruitment competition was published and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years &mdash; periods of illegal residence or residence as an asylum seeker in the State do not count for this qualifying five year period. To be eligible for selection as a trainee an applicant must have obtained, in the Irish established leaving certificate examination or Irish leaving certificate vocational programme a grade not lower than B3 at foundation level or D3 at another level in mathematics and a qualifying grade in two languages, at least one of which must be English or Irish, if Irish, a grade not lower than C3 at foundation level or D3 at another level and if English or another language, a grade not lower than D3 at ordinary level and a grade not lower than D3 at ordinary level in not less than two other subjects, the merit grade in the applied leaving certificate or like grades in another examination, which, in the opinion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is not of a lower standard than the above.</P>
        <P>Among the qualifications which are considered as acceptable alternatives to the leaving certificate examination are the following: matriculation of a recognised university; a general certificate of education, advanced level; NCEA or HETAC national certificate; or NCEA or HETAC National Diploma. Applicants with any such alternative qualifications must hold qualifications equivalent to those referred to above in mathematics, English or Irish and one other language. <Col N="1043"/>Any person who exceeds the minimum requirements as to educational qualifications, which could include holding a masters qualification, is clearly not at any disadvantage in the Garda recruitment process.</P>

	<P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is a unique event in the global calendar. On 17 March, the world&rsquo;s attention turns to Ireland and all things Irish. Our national day is celebrated by millions of people from Beijing to Brussels and Sydney to Seattle. This goodwill and attention offers an unrivalled opportunity to promote modern Ireland overseas and to engage directly on a variety of issues. In deciding on Ministerial travel commitments for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the Government has sought to maximise opportunities for showcasing Ireland as a world class economy and tourism destination. Ministers travelling over the period will promote Ireland at business, cultural and community events in more than 35 cities in all corners of the world.</P>
        <P>In addition, this year there will be a particular focus on promoting Ireland as a &ldquo;knowledge economy&rdquo;. Ideas and knowledge have transformed Irish business and industry. Our continued economic development is dependent on further enhancing our position in the globally competitive market for knowledge-driven investment and innovation. Our success in this area is already evidenced by the growing international profile of top level Irish scientists and entrepreneurs, and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day provides an invaluable opportunity to reinforce this message. St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is equally an important occasion for enhancing our links with Irish communities abroad. The Government greatly values the opportunity to express our appreciation for the important work of Irish community and friendship groups, and attendance at their community events will form an integral part of Ministerial programmes during the period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I can confirm to the Deputy that I am travelling to London to participate in the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations. As well as being home to the largest Irish communities in the world, Britain is also Ireland&rsquo;s largest trading partner with total trade in 2004 showing a 2.2% increase over 2003. Ireland now accounts for about 11% of total food <Col N="1045"/>and beverage imports into the UK. In addition, the Government has made the provision of emigrant services in Britain a priority and last year allocated over &euro;7 million in financial support through the Dion fund to voluntary agencies that help vulnerable Irish people in Britain. The primary emphasis continues to be the provision of assistance to front line Irish community care organisations assisting the more marginalised members of the community in Britain.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will be taking full advantage of my visit to promote Ireland as an attractive tourist destination, to further strengthen the links with our emigrant community and to promote business. My itinerary includes: attending the mayor&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s dinner; attending the Council of Irish County Associations St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day mass; attending brunch organised by Tourism Ireland; leading the St. Patrick&rsquo;s parade; and visiting the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival exhibition.</P>

        <P>The third complaint was addressed to the Garda Commissioner, and a Garda superintendent was appointed to investigate the allegations. However, the complainant failed to co-operate with the investigation and the matter could not be processed. He was informed of this in writing on 27 October 2004.

	<P>There is a particular overriding necessity, in view of the recent increase in violent crime involving firearms, to ensure that public safety and security are given priority in any review of policy and legislation in relation to firearms. With this in mind I propose to bring forward a wide range of amendments to the Firearms Acts 1925-2000 in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Included in these new proposals are measures which will create mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest. It will require all persons wishing to legally hold a firearm to satisfy the Garda that they have provided secure accommodation for the firearm. It will allow the Minister to deem certain firearms as restricted by reference to specific criteria, including the calibre, action type and muzzle energy of the firearm. In future, any person wishing to obtain a certificate for such a firearm will have to apply directly to the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The legislation will introduce new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as &ldquo;sawing-off&rdquo; a shotgun, and increase fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts. I also intend to introduce a statutory <Col N="1047"/>basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before new penalties, and minimum mandatory sentences, are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position, and thus enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to concentrate on more serious offenders.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat the illegal importation, sale and possession of firearms through intelligence-led operations and activities. Operation Anvil, launched in May last year, and aimed at those involved in gun crime of any kind, is one of the most intensive special policing operations ever undertaken in the State. It is intelligence-driven and has significant levels of Garda resources. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are receiving resources this year to continue Operation Anvil and I have asked the Commissioner to extend it to Garda divisions outside Dublin.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil contributed to the increase of 16% in the detection of possession of firearms in 2005. Up to 19 February 2006, Operation Anvil resulted in over 1,600 arrests, including 23 for murder, over 13,200 searches, including 360 searches for firearms that resulted in 359 firearms seized or recovered, and the recovery of property with a value of &euro;5.7 million.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year has the highest level of resources in its history &mdash;&euro;1,290 million, which is an increase of &euro;146 million or 13% on 2005. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is &euro;83.5 million, an increase of &euro;23 million on the allocation for 2005. This increase will greatly assist the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention, including gun crimes. The &euro;83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.</P>
        <P>I take great satisfaction in the Government&rsquo;s decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year and 14,000 attested garda&iacute; in two years&rsquo; time. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational and high-visibility policing.</P>

        <Quest>the steps he intends to take to combat the increase in headline crimes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I took the decision to <Col N="1048"/>publish crime statistics on a quarterly basis at the beginning of 2003, I have consistently emphasised that care must be taken in interpreting the statistics, especially when considering short-term fluctuations and extrapolating trends over short periods. The level of headline crime in 2005 is actually lower than that for 2003 by 1.6% and for 2002 by 4.4%. Furthermore, in 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population.</P>
        <P>Our headline crime rate continues to compare very favourably with those of our nearest neighbours. In England and Wales in the year April 2003 to March 2004, the most recent for which figures are available, 113 crimes were committed per 1,000 population. In 2004 and 2005 in Scotland there were 86.3 crimes per 1,000 population and in Northern Ireland 69 per 1,000 population compared with our rate of 24.6 per 1,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome in particular the significant decrease of 27% in the number of incidents of robbery of cash and goods in transit, down from 62 in 2004 to 45 in 2005. This trend improved in the fourth quarter, with a decrease of 47%. Operation Delivery, an initiative undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to counteract the increase in cash in transit robberies which emerged in 2004, has contributed significantly to this very welcome decrease. Furthermore, the new code of practice now being operated by the major financial institutions and security companies involved in the cash in transit industry, has dramatically raised the standards in operation. I took a direct personal hand in dialogue with the leadership in the banking and security sectors in securing adoption of this new code. It has made a significant contribution to this decrease. These developments have been underpinned by the establishment of the Private Security Authority, which has also taken place on my watch.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the increase in the number of detections for possession of drugs for sale or supply, up 20%, and possession of firearms, up<?oasys _jy ?>16%. In both cases these are offences which in the main become known as a result of active police detection work. This trend continued in the fourth quarter and, in the case of possession of firearms, improved, with an increase of 24%. These are statistical crime figure increases which we should welcome because they are detections flowing from increased police vigilance and a proactive approach.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil, which the Commissioner introduced last May and for which I obtained substantial additional resources, made a significant contribution to this level of detection. Operation Anvil will continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational and policing terms. At my request, the Commissioner has extended Operation Anvil to Garda divisions outside Dublin. The most recent figures available show that <Col N="1049"/>Operation Anvil has contributed to encouraging outcomes, with a total number of arrests of 1,641, which includes 23 arrests for murder, 411 arrests for serious assaults, 828 arrests for burglary and 379 arrests for robbery offences. Furthermore, the total number of firearms seized to date under Operation Anvil is 359, and property to the value of more than &euro;5.7 million has been recovered.</P>
        <P>While it is the case that a number of the increases in headline crime statistics reflect increased enforcement activity on the part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the overall picture indicates that there is no room for complacency. The Government&rsquo;s decision to continue to devote unprecedented resources to the fight against crime is clearly justified, as is my insistence that those resources be deployed at the front line of policing in this State.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year has the highest level of resources in its history, &euro;1,290 million, an increase of &euro;146 million or 13% on 2005. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is &euro;83.5 million, an increase of &euro;23 million on the allocation for 2005. This increase will greatly assist the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention. The &euro;83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.</P>
        <P>I take great satisfaction in the Government&rsquo;s decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 in 2006 and 14,000 attested garda&iacute; in two years&rsquo; time. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. I am also pleased to state that an additional 55 members were allocated to augment the organised crime unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation to address the problem of criminal gang activity.</P>
        <P>In addition to this increase in resources, I am also bringing forward proposals to strengthen significantly the legislative provisions available. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004 provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences. It contains an essential updating of our law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society. It addresses such matters as the preservation of crime scenes, increased periods of detention in the case of arrestable offences, search warrant powers for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amendments to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990, provision for a fixed penalty procedure in respect of certain <Col N="1050"/>lesser public order offences and the admissibility of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements.</P>
        <P>I also propose to bring forward a wide range of amendments to the Firearms Acts 1925-2000 in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the D&aacute;il. Included in these new proposals are measures which will create mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest. It will require all persons, wishing to legally hold a firearm, to satisfy the Garda that they have provided secure accommodation for the firearm.</P>
        <P>The legislation will allow the Minister to deem certain firearms as restricted by reference to specific criteria, including the calibre, action type and muzzle energy of the firearm. In future, any person wishing to obtain a certificate for such a firearm will have to apply directly to the Garda Commissioner. The legislation will also introduce new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as &ldquo;sawing-off&rdquo; a shotgun and increase fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts.</P>
        <P>I also intend to introduce a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before new penalties, and minimum mandatory sentences, are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position, and thus enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to concentrate on more serious offenders.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing plan for 2006, recently published by the Commissioner, includes a targeted reduction in the incidence of crime. It also reflects the Government&rsquo;s priorities in the fight against crime and the actions which it wishes to be taken. It will focus on crime prevention and reduction, including the prevention, in co-operation with local authorities through the joint policing committees and interaction with local communities, of public order offences, with particular emphasis on those resulting from alcohol and substance abuse. The committee&rsquo;s function will be to serve as a forum for consultations, discussions and recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the local authority&rsquo;s administrative area. I will shortly announce details of the establishment of a number of committees on a pilot basis.</P>
        <P>It will also focus on high value white collar crime, including trading in contraband goods, in co-operation with legitimate business interests and other law enforcement services in the State <Col N="1051"/>and abroad. It will expand significantly Garda youth diversion schemes targeted towards at risk young people with a view to having 100 of these community-based schemes in operation by end 2007.</P>
        <P>I can assure Deputies that the legal, operational measures and resources in place to tackle crime are kept under continuing review and any further measures and resources which are required will be made available. The Garda Commissioner informs me that he is at this time satisfied with the level of resources available to him.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 178, 180 and 183 together.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na employs a range of techniques in the fight against serious crime. The establishment of specialist Garda units, operating under the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services, has enabled the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle organised crime effectively. The National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is the Garda specialist unit tasked with the role of tackling organised crime. It carries out this role by conducting intelligence-driven operations in close co-operation with other specialist units including the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>An additional 55 officers were allocated to the organised crime unit of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation to augment the effort to target groups involved in organised crime in the Dublin metropolitan region. The unit is headed by a detective chief superintendent and works closely with Garda deployed on Operation Anvil and with other specialist units.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now better resourced than at any time in its history. I am particularly pleased to have secured a &euro;144 million increase, 13.2%, in the Garda Vote for this year from Government. The Garda budget is now at an all-time high and will exceed &euro;1.2 billion for 2006. This year the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will <Col N="1052"/>reach 14,000 members as outlined in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision for Garda overtime has increased by over &euro;22 million, bringing the total overtime provision to &euro;83.5 million for 2006. This will facilitate, among other things, the continuation of operations targeted at the prevention and detection of crimes such as gangland murders, organised crime, racketeering and other criminal activity which gives rise to serious community concern. The Government&rsquo;s top policing priority for 2006 is to continue to target organised crime, including drug trafficking, and the gun culture associated with it, through the use of specialist units and targeted, intelligence-led operations.</P>
        <P>As a specific response to the problem of gun crime in Dublin, the Government decided to provide funding for Operation Anvil. This operation was undertaken, not as the sole response to this problem, but as a targeted response to augment the work which the Garda was doing each day to address gun crime. Operation Anvil targets active criminals and their associates through the use of measures such as overt patrolling, static checkpoints, uniformed mobile and foot patrols supported by armed plain-clothes patrols and covert operations.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil has resulted in a number of very successful outcomes, including the seizure of 359 firearms. In addition, 24,758 checkpoints and 7,705 drugs searches have been carried out. It is intended to extend this operation nationwide during this year. In addition, I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Delivery was set up to combat robberies of institutions and to target those involved in robberies of high value goods in transit.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that strategies are in place for dealing with drug offences and are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs. These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies both within and outside the jurisdiction to address the national and international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities further inform me that these strategies continue to result in operational successes. The trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs at local, national and international levels is constantly monitored by the Garda. I am informed by the Garda authorities that Irish organised criminal groupings can be divided into two general categories. The first category consists of individuals or groups that are well-established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups whose <Col N="1053"/>activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland. I am further informed that there are no indications to suggest any major increases in either of these categories.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is widely acknowledged that our legislative package for tackling serious and organised crime is already one of the toughest in Europe. The Criminal Justice Bill, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences. In November last year, I obtained Government approval to draft a range of amendments to the Bill. Proposed amendments include the creation of criminal offences with regard to participation in organised crime, the strengthening of existing provisions for the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking and a range of amendments to the Firearms Acts.</P>
        <P>I can assure the House that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling serious crime under continuing review.</P>

	<P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, remains as when I announced the Government&rsquo;s approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year, with a fully attested strength of 14,000 by 2008.</P>
        <P>As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the first incremental increase of newly attested garda&iacute; due to the programme of accelerated recruitment into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take place on 16 March. On that day some 270 trainees will be attested to the force, a figure that provides concrete proof that the project to increase the strength of the <Col N="1054"/>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-<?oasys _ch ?>visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Under the Firearms Acts 1925-2000, it is unlawful for any person to possess, use or carry a firearm unless authorised by a firearm certificate granted by a superintendent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Before granting such certificate the superintendent must be satisfied that the person seeking it has a good reason for requiring the firearm in question, does not pose a danger to public safety or the peace and is not a person disentitled, under the Acts, to hold a firearms certificate. Only a superintendent may grant a firearms certificate and I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
        <P>In the Criminal Justice Bill, 2004, which is currently before the House, I propose to bring forward a range of measures to strengthen the law governing the control of firearms. These new measures include provisions whereby I may, by order, specify certain firearms as &ldquo;restricted firearms&rdquo; by reference to the category, calibre, muzzle energy, working mechanism and description of the firearm. A firearms certificate may only be granted by the Garda Commissioner in respect of firearms deemed restricted. In addition, I am providing that the matters which must be considered when deciding whether to grant a firearms certificate be extended to cover, among other things, the appropriateness of the firearm for the purpose for which the certificate is sought, the safe storage of the firearm, proof of <Col N="1055"/>competence in the use of the firearm and consent to inquiries as to the applicant&rsquo;s medical history.</P>
        <P>I am also providing for increases in fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts and the creation of mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.</P>

Her asylum claim was independently investigated by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that she did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The person concerned had her case considered under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amendedm and section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of <i>refoulement,</i> following which I signed a deportation order on 27 February 2006.

	<P>I have been informed that no further information has been received from the person in question relating to his marital status. The person in question was married according to a traditional marriage ceremony. I understand that information received by my Department indicates that the marriage is not recognised as a civil marriage in the country where it took place. The onus is on the applicant to show that the marriage is valid and recognised for the purpose of family reunification. The applicant was informed by letter on 17 January 2006 that he may seek a declaration from the Irish courts under section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995, that the marriage in question is a valid marriage.</P>

        <P>It must be again emphasised that the person concerned is not being returned to her country of origin but rather to Belgium. She had lodged a previous asylum claim in Belgium and, in accordance with the Dublin II Regulations, it is entirely appropriate that she be returned to have her asylum claim determined there. It can hardly be argued that Belgium&rsquo;s welfare, medical and social protection systems are inferior to ours or that any international protection she requires cannot be provided by the Belgian authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The person concerned is currently illegally present in this State but her removal to Belgium will, nonetheless, be handled with sensitivity and care, particularly as I understand that she is currently in receipt of hospital treatment. Officials in my Department have asked the legal representatives of the person concerned, the refugee legal service, to keep the Garda National Immigration Bureau informed of the whereabouts and up-to-date medical condition of the person concerned and I have been assured that the bureau will not effect her transfer to Belgium until such time as she is discharged from hospital. Additionally, the Belgian authorities will be informed of her medical status prior to her arrival and if necessary, medical escorts will be provided to accompany her on her journey.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that the procedure being adopted in this case is in any way contrary to best humanitarian practice. Indeed, the fact that she is being returned to Belgium to have her asylum claim considered in the State where she first sought protection is fully in accord with humanitarian principles.</P>

The last period of legal residency in the State granted to him was from 2 June 2002 to 1 June 2003. Registration with the Garda National Immigration Bureau was refused in June 2003 due to a change in this person&rsquo;s circumstances.

	<P>Offending behaviour by children including petty crime is a serious matter and improving the State&rsquo;s response to this problem is a priority within my Department. I have recently established a dedicated section to address issues of youth offending.</P>
        <P>In October 2004, an internal project team was established within my Department to examine the scope for rationalising and restructuring the delivery of the State&rsquo;s services in the area of youth justice in accordance with the legislative basis provided for in the Children Act 2001. Publication of the report on the youth justice review was approved by Government in December 2005 and the Government agreed to the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations in addition to a number of other youth justice reforms.</P><Col N="1062"/>
        <P>Among the reforms agreed was the establishment of a youth justice service on a non-statutory basis as an executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The service will focus on developing a national youth justice strategy, achieving the full implementation of the Children Act 2001, assuming responsibility for children&rsquo;s detention and improving the delivery of services for young offenders. The Government also agreed to the drafting of legislative amendments to provide for the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs, for those aged under 18 years to address anti-social behaviour by children. Under these provisions, a child will first be dealt with under the Garda diversion programme and parents will be involved from an early stage.</P>
        <P>The Garda juvenile diversion programme was introduced to provide an opportunity to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity. It operates under the supervision and direction of the Garda national juvenile office, Harcourt Square, and is implemented throughout all Garda divisions by 94 specially trained garda&iacute; known as juvenile liaison officers, JLOs. The Children Act 2001 places the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a statutory basis and incorporates into it as new features restorative cautioning and conferencing. In addition, under the Act, the age limit for inclusion in the programme was increased from 17 to 18 years of age. The programme is used to its greatest extent in relation to minor offences and-or for those with no or only one or two experiences of offending.</P>
        <P>Garda youth diversion projects are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved or further involved in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve prospects of employability. The projects are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and administered by the community relations section of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. A budget of &euro;6.6 million has been provided for the Garda youth diversion projects and local drugs task force projects in 2006. I am committed to the continuing development and the expansion of Garda youth diversion projects. It is my intention to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>While matters relating to school attendance and child care and protection issues are the responsibility of the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children respectively, the report on the youth justice review recognised that cross-departmental co-operation is essential to meet the needs of at risk children. The youth justice service is developing links with other relevant Departments and agencies and will operate within the strategic environment of the office of the Minister for children under the Minister of <Col N="1063"/>State with special responsibility for children to ensure that a joined-up approach to service delivery is achieved. I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in respect of the named persons and I will contact the Deputy again when the report is to hand.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that while the number of seizures of freebase or crack cocaine continues to represent a very small proportion of the total number of cocaine seizures recorded annually, there has been an increase in the number of such seizures in this jurisdiction over the past three years. This is a matter of concern and the Garda authorities have taken a number of measures to address the problem.</P>
        <P>The Garda national drugs unit and local drugs units conduct intelligence-driven operations to target individuals suspected of involvement in the distribution of freebase cocaine. Drug units and community policing personnel are engaged in intelligence gathering on individuals and groups suspected of involvement in the sale and distribution of the drug. There is also targeted patrolling by uniformed and plain clothes personnel of problem areas in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in such activity.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Drugs Strategy 2001-08 addresses the problem of drug misuse across a number of pillars &mdash; supply reduction, prevention, treatment rehabilitation and research &mdash; and implementation of the strategy across a range of Departments and agencies is co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The Government is aware of the increased prevalence of cocaine usage in recent times and efforts to tackle it are broadly based to include measures aimed at both supply and demand reduction, including awareness initiatives.</P>
        <P>It is a key objective of the national drugs strategy to reduce access to all drugs, particularly those drugs that cause most harm, to young people especially in those areas where misuse is most prevalent. The strategy specifies a number of supply reduction targets for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of all drug seizures and the Garda have achieved considerable successes in relation to these targets to date. The trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs, including hydrochloric and freebase cocaine, at local, national and international levels will continue to be vigilantly monitored by the Garda.</P><Col N="1064"/>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Bill, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures that will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences, including drug offences. It includes provisions relating to search warrant powers for the Garda. In November 2005, I obtained Government approval to draft a range of amendments to the Bill, which I intend to table during its passage through the Oireachtas. Proposed amendments include the creation of criminal offences in relation to participation in organised crime and the strengthening of existing provisions for the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. Those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>

Permission to remain in the State on foot of parentage of an Irish born child was granted on 26 August 1999.</P>
        <P>The person concerned applied for a certificate of naturalisation in December 2002. Since he did not meet the statutory residency requirement at that time, his application was deemed ineligible. He was informed of this in writing in January 2005.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s post-primary school transport scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if he or she resides 4.8 km or more from his or her local post-primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which he or she lives. The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area, otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.</P>
        <P>The number of spare seats available will not be known until all other eligible children travelling to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside have been assessed for transport. Every effort will be made to determine the number of such seats available well in advance of the next school year.</P>
        <P>Parents who have enrolled or intend to enrol their children in schools outside of the catchment area in which they reside are advised to acquaint <Col N="1066"/>themselves with the terms of the school transport scheme as transport cannot be guaranteed for such pupils.</P>

	<P>Funding is provided to primary and secondary schools by way of <i>per capita </i>grants, which afford schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.</P>
        <P>Primary schools&rsquo; running costs are met by my Department&rsquo;s scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools. The capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil to &euro;133.58 with effect from 1 January 2005 and has been further increased by &euro;12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2006 bringing the standard rate to &euro;145.58. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</P>
        <P>At second level, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant which stood at &euro;256 per pupil in the school year 2001-02 has been increased by a further &euro;12 to &euro;298 per pupil from January 2006. Under the school services support fund initiative, secondary schools will also benefit from the further significant increases. The grant that was increased for secondary schools from &euro;131 per pupil in January 2005 to &euro;145 per pupil, has been increased by a further &euro;14 per pupil to &euro;159 per pupil from January 2006. These grants are in addition to the <i>per capita</i> funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. A secondary school with 500 pupils now receives annual grants of up to &euro;270,000 towards general expenses and support services as against annual grants of up to &euro;237,000 in 2002.</P>
        <P>Local authority service and other charges payable to the various local authorities do not come within the remit of my Department. It would be a matter for the local authorities to decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges. In the case of waste charges, some local authorities have a flat fee for schools while others waive the fee where the school has achieved the green flag status. Where it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost would form part of the normal running costs of schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools have received from my Department.</P>
        <P>It would not be feasible for my Department to introduce specific schemes whereby grant assistance would be provided to schools in respect of individual charges such as water charges.</P>

	<P>Home tuition is primarily intended to provide compensatory instruction for pupils with a medical ailment that is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school on a con<Col N="1069"/>tinuing basis. In recent years home tuition has been extended as an interim support for children with a significant special educational need pending the provision of an appropriate school based educational service. Grant approval is based on the application details of each case and a recommendation from my Department&rsquo;s professionals, if required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, my Department considers that school-based education provision is the most appropriate intervention for all children, including those with special educational needs. In this regard, home tuition is only intended as an interim measure until a suitable school placement is secured. In the circumstances, my Department has discontinued the practice whereby children who are in full-time education provision would also be able to avail of home tuition grants. My Department asked the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to have a special educational needs organiser to ensure in each case that the child is getting the appropriate support in their school.</P>
        <P>The pupil in question is enrolled in a mainstream primary school with five hours resource teaching and the added support of a special needs assistant. As the pupil is in full-time education, the matter of the continuance of home tuition no longer arises and the parents were informed from September of this year onwards that it was being discontinued with effect from 10 February 2006.</P>

The first step for these schools is the appointment of an architectural team that will design and plan the works. To aid the schools in appointing these architectural teams and to brief them on the steps involved in progressing their projects, the school building section will host an information seminar for the boards of management in Tullamore on Wednesday, 22 March.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Education and Science does not have a dedicated section dealing with the non-attendance of children at school. However under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 the National Edu<Col N="1074"/>cational Welfare Board, NEWB, was established as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The NEWB is a statutory agency operating under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the NEWB are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>The service is developing on a continuing basis. The total authorised staffing complement of the board is 94 comprising 16 headquarters and support staff, five regional managers, 12 senior educational welfare officers and 61 educational welfare officers. Towns which have an educational welfare officer allocated to them include Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo, Naas, Castlebar, Longford, Tuam, Tullamore, Letterkenny and Portlaoise. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Since September 2005 every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service.</P>
        <P>A key focus of the Government&rsquo;s education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. In addition to the NEWB staff there are some 490 staff in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for integrated working between the different services involved.</P>
        <P>Last year I launched DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, an action plan for educational inclusion. The action plan aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new action plan will place a renewed emphasis on the involvement of parents and families in children&rsquo;s education in schools. The Department and the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, will work together to ensure that an integrated approach to children at risk is adopted.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated in the reply to Question No. 504 of 28 February 2006, battery operated watches and clocks with a voltage rating not exceeding 1,500 volts for direct current, DC, are within the scope of the WEEE directive. Consequently, retailers are required to take back such items at end of life on a one-for-one basis when selling a similar product. Alternatively members of the public can deposit waste battery operated watches and clocks at any local authority civic amenity facility catering for WEEE free of charge. Producers placing these products on the market are responsible for recycling them at end of life.</P>
        <P>There is no levy on electrical and electronic products placed on the market. The WEEE directive allows producers to show the cost of recovering and recycling &ldquo;historic&rdquo; waste, that is waste arising from electric and electronic products put on the market before 13 August 2005. These costs are referred to as environmental management costs, EMCs. They are not imposed by, or remitted to, the Government, but are paid by producers to the two collective compliance schemes operating in Ireland, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform. These schemes are operating a producer responsibility initiative. The purpose of the EMCs is to enable the schemes to pay for the environmentally sound management of all household WEEE taken back by retailers or deposited by members of the public at local authority civic amenity sites.</P>
        <P>The EMCs currently applied show the costs of recycling based on data submitted by producers to the WEEE Register Society Limited, the industry-based national WEEE registration body, which has an independent committee of management. The WEEE Register Society assessed and approved the EMCs and my Department has no function in the matter. Following a partial review <Col N="1078"/>of EMCs, a reduction to zero euro of the EMCs for clocks and watches was implemented by WEEE Register Society on 5 December 2005. EMCs are input costs and how these are dealt with in the pricing of products is part of the normal negotiations between producer and retailer.</P>
        <P>The WEEE scheme has been operating for six months and the real benefits of this new system for consumers and the environment are becoming apparent. WEEE is now being collected from over 180 collection points nationwide. Early indications are that significant quantities of this waste type are being returned for recycling. In the first 12 weeks alone 4,800 tonnes, equivalent to an annual rate of almost 20,000 tonnes, of household WEEE was collected. This points to a fourfold increase in the recycling of household WEEE as 5,510 tonnes of this waste type was recovered in 2004, and indicates widespread public support for the implementation of the directive.</P>

	<P>Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, ELVs, incorporates measures aimed at: meeting new recovery and recycling targets for ELVs; ensuring that all end-of-life vehicles are deposited, dismantled, treated and recovered by industry at no cost to the final holder or owner of that vehicle and in a manner that does not cause environmental pollution; producers meeting the costs of free take-back of end-of-life vehicles with no market value; introducing systems whereby certificates of destruction are notified to the vehicle registration authorities on the deposit of end-of-life vehicles <Col N="1079"/>by their registered owners at authorised treatment facilities, ATFs, for appropriate treatment and recovery; and minimising the use of specified hazardous substances in vehicles.</P>
        <P>Enabling legislative provisions were included in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, which inserts a new part in the Waste Management Act 1996, to facilitate the development of regulations concerning implementation of the directive. I recently published draft waste management, end-of-life, vehicle regulations 2006 which will fully transpose and provide the framework for the implementation of the ELV directive. The regulations have been published in draft form to allow for a period of public consultation until 24 March.</P>
        <P>Under the draft regulations, responsibility for putting in place a national network of authorised treatment facilities providing take-back of end-of-life vehicles of any particular brand will rest with the producer of that brand. As is the case in a number of European Union member states, issues in relation to cost of take-back of end-of-life vehicles will be the subject of contractual arrangements between each producer and the ATFs that form part of that producer&rsquo;s national network.</P>

	<P>In 2004, the latest year for which complete information is available, the estimated expenditure by local authorities in respect of the operation and maintenance of public water supplies was some &euro;214 million. Such expenditure is funded from a combination of non-domestic user charges, general purpose grants and specific grants.</P>
        <P>In line with the polluter pays principle and the water services pricing framework adopted by the Government, the operation and maintenance costs of water supplies in respect of the non-domestic sector are recoupable from that sector. General purpose grants from the local government fund are discretionary block grants paid to local authorities as a contribution to their current costs, including domestic water services. In calculating these grants a wide range of relevant factors are taken into consideration, including population and the cost of operating and maintaining the domestic element of water supplies. In 2006, I allocated some &euro;875 million to local authorities in general purpose grants. This represents an average increase of about 7%, more than double the rate of inflation, over the corresponding figure for 2005.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have also been able to provide special assistance from the local government fund in recent years to help local authorities to meet the operating costs arising on newly commissioned water and wastewater treatment plants pending the reflection of these costs in the needs and resources model which is used in the allocation of general purpose grants. Some &euro;7.5 million has been allocated to local authorities for this purpose in 2006. My Department is also providing substantial funding to local authorities to reduce unaccounted for water in public water supply systems and to improve the efficiency of such systems, thereby reducing the level of operational and maintenance costs falling to be met by the local authorities.</P>

	<P>I assume that <Col N="1081"/>the question refers to general purpose grant allocations from the local government fund.</P>
        <P>General purpose grants are discretionary block grants paid to local authorities as a contribution towards their current costs. These costs are also funded by specific State grants and income from local sources such as commercial rates and charges for goods and services. It is a matter for each local authority, in the context of its annual budgetary process, to determine its own spending priorities having regard to the amount of funding available to it and local needs and circumstances. I have no proposals to introduce greater central prescription into this process by directing local authorities in relation to the spreading of their general purpose grants.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s national water services pricing policy framework requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes.</P>
        <P>The unit cost of water services provision will differ between sanitary authorities given the differences in the costs of water production across each local authority area and the economies of scale that apply. Sanitary authorities are in accordance with Government policy moving to a more uniform system for determining and applying these charges. It is however a matter for each sanitary authority to set the appropriate level of charges for non-domestic users of water services subject to the policy framework provision for the full recovery of actual costs and water and waste water charges being determined having regard to this principle.</P>
        <P>I do not consider that current arrangements for the funding of water services have contributed to the variances in the cost of water services between sanitary authorities. In this regard, the capital cost of domestic water services is funded in full by the Exchequer and has benefited from a significant investment of &euro;2.7 billion since 2000. The operational cost of providing water services for domestic purposes is met by grants from the local government fund, in particular through the general purpose grant which will amount to some &euro;875 million in 2006. I believe that with prudent use of this funding and the pursuit of further efficiencies and expenditure rationalisation, local authorities will be adequately resourced to meet <Col N="1082"/>demands including domestic water services provision in 2006 and beyond.</P>

	<P>Following the approval by Cork County Council of the comprehensive feasibility assessment carried out on this site, an amendment to the local area plan was advertised on 20 February 2006 and will remain on public display for inspection until 3 April 2006 in the two relevant divisional areas. In parallel with this process, the council is also engaging with consultants to draw up plans for the relevant tender documentation.</P>
        <P>The measures being undertaken by the council are necessary to ensure the transparency of the process and will hopefully result in a development that will be acceptable to all interested parties. Commencement of construction on the site will be contingent on the outcome of the planning process.</P>

	<P>A Law Reform Commission working group is currently examining a range of legal issues in relation to the management of multi-unit structures. The Government will consider the recommendations in its final report, including the need for any new legislation in this area.</P>
        <P>Following a request for information from my Department, I understand that the majority of planning authorities do not attach conditions to planning permissions requiring management companies to be set up in the case of housing estates. A number do in specified circumstances, for example, where there is a shared waste water treatment plant between a number of houses.</P>
        <P>The Department issued circular letter PD 1/06 on 25 January 2006 reminding local authorities of their obligations under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in relation to taking in charge of estates. The circular letter also clearly states that the existence of a management company to maintain elements of common build<Col N="1083"/>ings, carry out landscaping, etc. must not impact upon the decision by the authority to take in charge roads and related infrastructure where a request to do so is made.</P>
        <P>I am considering whether any further guidance should issue to planning authorities regarding planning conditions in relation to management companies.</P>

	<P>While local authorities are responsible for the operation and maintenance of their public water supply systems, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives over the years to assist authorities to optimise the management, quality and efficiency of such systems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1996, following publication of the greater Dublin water supply strategic study, a new capital funding line was introduced to help reduce unaccounted for water levels in local authority distribution networks, to improve the quality of supply to consumers, to lower operating costs and to maximise the value of investment in capital works. A series of pilot schemes to identify potential improvements, as well as some physical work on network rehabilitation, was undertaken as a first measure. Project locations included Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Athlone and Clonmel. All of these schemes have now been completed with the aid of capital funding of &euro;63 million from my Department. The results show that unaccounted for water rates have reduced considerably. For example, in Dublin they have fallen from 42.5% to 28.7%, in Donegal from 59% to 39%, in Meath from 47% to 34% and in Kilkenny from 45% to 29%.</P><Col N="1084"/>
        <P>The results of my Department&rsquo;s subsequent national water study, which involved an audit of all public water supplies outside the greater Dublin area serving more than 5,000 consumers, were published in March 2000. The study examined 91 water supply schemes operated by some 38 local authorities and reported on all aspects of water supply including availability of raw water, treatment capacity, water distribution systems and associated management issues. It found, <i>inter alia</i>, that unaccounted for water levels varied significantly between regions but were generally in the range of between 40% to 50%.</P>
        <P>In May 2003 the Department allocated a further &euro;276 million to local authorities to identify and substantially reduce unaccounted for water in public supply networks. The bulk of the allocation, &euro;194 million, was provided for network rehabilitation or replacement works by authorities that had carried out water management system studies under the earlier pilot phase. The balance of &euro;82 million will enable the remaining authorities to complete water management system studies as a necessary precursor to structural rehabilitation works. In November 2005, I increased the recoupment available to local authorities from the Department for certain water conservation activities from 75% to 90% to encourage and facilitate greater progress on the national water conservation programme generally. Details of allocations to individual authorities are set out in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-07, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>Detailed information on the cost of unaccounted for water in the public water supply system generally is not available in my Department. There are variations in the production costs of water between local authorities and, in addition, not all unaccounted for water is lost through leakage. A significant proportion relates to unauthorised or unrecorded connections. The universal metering of all non-domestic consumers which is scheduled for completion by end 2006, coupled with the local authorities&rsquo; ongoing water management system studies, will significantly improve the range of data available in this area and further help to reduce the levels of unaccounted for water.</P>

	<P>Exchequer funding for leak detection works and other infrastructural measures to improve the management of water supplies in the Dublin region was pro<Col N="1085"/>vided under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme as part of the Dublin region water conservation project between 1996 and 2000 during which unaccounted for water levels were reduced from 42% to below 29%. Following completion of this project in 2000, the local authorities concerned have assumed ongoing responsibility for leakage detection and repair as an operational function. Further information in this regard may appropriately be sought from Dublin City Council which is acting as lead authority for the region.</P>
        <P>A further allocation of &euro;118.3 million has been provided under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-07 for the rehabilitation of defective and unserviceable water mains in the Dublin region as part of a national water conservation sub-programme. I understand that Dublin City Council, also acting as lead authority in this case, has now appointed consultants to produce contract documents and to oversee the implementation of the relevant works in the region.</P>

	<P>The current output of the water production plants in the greater Dublin area &mdash; including Kildare, Meath and Wicklow &mdash; is approximately 582 million litres per day. The main water treatment plants providing water to the region are located at Ballyboden, Ballymore Eustace, Leixlip and Vartry.</P>
        <P>A range of projects to further expand capacity is being advanced under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-07. These include the Kildare Wellfield development, the Leixlip water treatment plant extension, Navan water supply scheme, Wicklow town water supply scheme and the expansion of the Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant. The Ballymore Eustace scheme will increase capacity by a further 44 million litres per day. A recently completed interim upgrade to the plant has already secured 22 million litres per day of this increase. In addition, the programme includes funding to support the identification of new sources to meet projected demand in the greater Dublin area up to 2031.</P>
        <P>Since 1996, over &euro;55 million has been spent on ongoing water conservation works in the region to reduce unaccounted for water and water losses in the distribution system. These measures, taken together, are designed to ensure the availability of adequate water supplies to meet the needs of the greater Dublin area in the medium term.</P>
