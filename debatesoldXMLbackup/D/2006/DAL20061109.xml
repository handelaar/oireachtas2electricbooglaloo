    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, the urgent necessity for significantly increased funding for the primary education sector to help meet the spiralling cost increases in electricity, heating, water supply and waste charges; the need for additional resources to reduce class sizes which remain unacceptably high; the requirement for classroom assistants for every infant class in primary school; the establishment of a system of State-funded early education for children with intellectual disabilities and the urgency of providing significant capital investment in the form of capitation grants to schools for the purchase of modern ICT equipment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance and concern, namely, the urgent need to assist 440,000 people, or 11% of the State&rsquo;s population, over 65 years of age particularly in terms of the huge increases in gas and electricity prices; the need for the Government to implement the policy document and budget submission of the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, Making Life Better for Older People; and to put in place adequate resources and comprehensive infrastructure for the care of our elderly and to make this a priority issue in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of major national and local importance, namely, the worthwhile initiative announced by Shell to Sea last Monday regarding the setting up of an independent public commission of inquiry to enable investigations into the optimum development <Col N="338"/>concept for the Corrib gas project and providing a reasonable and sensible approach to a resolution of the Corrib gas conflict through an open, transparent and democratic process through which community consent will be the key criterion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely, that this House debate the current financial stability report of the Central Bank which claims that house prices in this country are being over-valued by 14%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a specific matter requiring urgent attention, namely, the need for the Minister for Health and Children to intervene with the Health Service Executive with a view to reversing the executive&rsquo;s decision not to set up a prostate cancer screening programme as requested by a leading cancer specialist and to ask that the Minister make a statement on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent public importance, namely, the killing of 18 Palestinian civilians, including eight children and four women, by the Israelis yesterday in Gaza; the failure of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to unequivocally condemn this attack; and the need for the Government and the EU to use all means to ensure there is a proper peace plan for the region which addresses the continued problem of settlement expansion on the West Bank and includes the main actors in the regions, namely, Syria and Iran.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business"> 
    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 10<i>a</i> motion re the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern, Dundalk; No. 16, National Oil Reserves Agency Bill 2006 &mdash; Report and Final Stage, resumed, to adjourn at 1 p.m. if not previously concluded; and No. 18, statements on Transport 21, resumed, in accordance with the Order of the D&aacute;il on 2 March 2006.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 10<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 10<i>a</i> agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarification, will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the House will <Col N="339"/>have an opportunity to address the report of the sub-committee in the D&aacute;il Chamber as early as possible?  Will he accommodate the earliest address of the report in December rather than allowing it to drift in to the more difficult period prior to the Christmas recess when there is limited media attention to such matters?  If the T&aacute;naiste is in a position to clarify both of those issues, I would be grateful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, the sub-committee is seeking a two week extension of the time within which to prepare its report.  The report will then come back to the House and if the Deputy&rsquo;s Whip raises the matter with the Government Whip, I am sure his desire will be accommodated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal agreed?  Agreed.  I call Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform state if he proposes to make a statement to the House on the spate of tiger kidnappings in the country?</P>
        <P>Second, what is the status of the two reports into the Garda published by Senator Maurice Hayes and Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole which state that there are 66 garda&iacute; working in the IT section, 88 in human resources and 14 in the Garda press office?  Are they to be translated into change and will legislation be required?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a question for the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Third, the T&aacute;naiste is always prepared to be accountable to the House.  Last week, I raised with him the number of cases likely to be dropped under the statutory rape charges process.   The T&aacute;naiste did not answer that question.  Last June, a letter from me and Deputy Rabbitte was required to elicit responses.  Can the T&aacute;naiste now give us the answer to that question, in view of the work of the committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny should submit those questions to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle thinks I should submit questions to every line Minister.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that Members remain within Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>My job is to stand here and ask, under the appropriate legislation, questions of the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="340"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need for the Ceann Comhairle to protect the T&aacute;naiste.  He is able to answer for himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is not protecting anybody.  If the Deputy is not happy with Standing Order 26, he knows what to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need for the Ceann Comhairle to make suggestions about what we should ask because we understand the rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business.  Deputy Kenny should ask about legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately for Members on both sides of the House &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Both sides.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Chair has to rule on what is and is not appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair presumes to know what Opposition Deputies want to ask.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in accordance with Standing Orders laid down by this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste four perfectly legitimate questions.  He is a man given on occasion to not incomplete sentences, so I am sure he is prepared to answer my questions in the public interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be orderly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny will be aware that I answered questions on tiger kidnappings during oral questions this week, during which time a lengthy discussion was held.  I congratulate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the work it is doing with regard to investigating these cases and I had discussions on the subject with the Commissioner today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to give an answer to the Deputy on decisions taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions with regard to whether individual cases will be prosecuted because that is a matter for the independent judgment of the DPP.  If I come into possession of information which I can pass on to Deputy Kenny and others, I will do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the status of the reports produced by Senator Maurice Hayes and Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the implementation of the recommendations contained in the reports by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na <Col N="341"/>Inspectorate and Senator Maurice Hayes will not require legislation and it is the intention of the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to expedite their implementation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste advised us that he was to receive the report of the working group on domestic partnership by 20 October.  Has he received the report and does he anticipate that a constitutional amendment will arise from it?  Given the apparent intention of the Government to hold a referendum in the near future, would it be appropriate to take the entirety of amendments at the same time?</P>
        <P>When the amendment on judicial misconduct collapsed and was withdrawn in 2001, the Government promised to introduce legislation.  Some five years later, that legislation, the judicial council Bill, remains on the legislative programme.  Without making any reference to current matters, when is it proposed to bring the Bill before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am told that I will receive the report to which Deputy Rabbitte refers in the next two weeks.  I have seen a draft of the report and I will publish it as soon as I have it to hand.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s question on a referendum, the Taoiseach has indicated that the Government will propose to deal with the issue of civil partnerships on a sub-constitutional basis because it is his judgment, which I share, that a constitutional referendum on the matter would be divisive and unlikely to succeed.</P>
        <P>I have made proposals in respect of the judicial council Bill which are currently being considered by the Chief Justice.  I am awaiting his views before proceeding and, as soon as he offers me a clear opinion on alternative methods for dealing with the matter, I will arrange for the legislation to be expedited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste join me in condemning the comments of certain irresponsible public representatives that is all right to drink and drive?  Does he agree that the Government&rsquo;s own attitude to our biggest drug problem, alcohol, is somewhat ambivalent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, that does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It pertains to promised legislation.  The reason for the Government&rsquo;s ambivalence is that it dropped the alcohol products Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not debating, I am asking a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy has legislation in mind, he should ask a question on it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="342"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to my question on the alcohol products Bill, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to refrain from offering the stock answer about voluntary agreements.  Will he join me in condemning those public representatives?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should confine himself to the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we have the alcohol products Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Crawford asked about the alcohol products Bill yesterday and his question was answered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The position regarding the alcohol products Bill is that voluntary agreements have been reached with the alcohol and advertising industries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always the same answer. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gormley does not want that answer; he wants a different one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the T&aacute;naiste to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department, therefore, wishes to delay the introduction of this legislation pending the outcome and evaluation of the voluntary arrangements.  I am aware it is hard for some people to accept that it is sometimes better to achieve ends by means of voluntary agreements than by compulsory legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is kowtowing to the alcohol industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Did Deputy Gormley have a second question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste condemn the public representatives to whom I referred?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly condemn anybody who defends breaking of the law.  We all live in a constitutional democracy and Article 9 of the Constitution states that loyalty to the State is the fundamental duty of every citizen.  Those elected to public office have a special duty to uphold the law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Today, the Central Bank alerted us to the totally dysfunctional nature of the Government&rsquo;s housing policy, which at present provides only one affordable house for every 40 houses built.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the housing miscellaneous provisions Bill, which is intended to <Col N="343"/>provide for the rental accommodation scheme.  The Central Bank has advised that four out of five people will not be able to afford housing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot discuss on the Order of Business matters he could raise on Second Stage of a Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the sole element of Government policy that people will be restricted to renting because of the problems that have emerged in terms of affordability?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation will be introduced next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, Deputy Rabbitte told the House that Deputy Wall&rsquo;s name had been removed from the register of voters.  Last night, I checked the register and discovered that not only was my name removed but so also were the names of my entire family.  I am not paranoid&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Deputy Stagg have a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but that does not mean they are not out to get me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It sounds like a purge to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government suggested legislation may be required to deal with the Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s proposal.  Although the Minister for Finance, who took the Order of Business yesterday, knew nothing about the issue, the T&aacute;naiste may be better informed.  Can he tell us how, in terms of legislation, the Government intends to address the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that legislation is not promised.  If Deputy Stagg was to look more carefully at the register for County Kildare, he would find himself in the K Club.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague is doing well for himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That goes to prove Labour&rsquo;s responsibility for creating the Celtic tiger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste indicate whether the Chief Whip will accommodate an opportunity in the coming week to debate the issue of voter registration with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If a debate is not promised, it is a matter for the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will time be allocated in the coming week to address the substantive <Col N="344"/>issues which have been highlighted in regard to the electoral register?</P>
        <P>With regard to the promise by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to introduce a broadcasting Bill in the coming year, can the T&aacute;naiste indicate when that legislation will be brought before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, an e-consultation process is under way.  When that process is completed, the matter will be further progressed.</P>
        <P>No proposals have been made in respect of holding a debate in the House on the issue of the register.  I urge everyone, as has the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to check the register and to comply with the legal provisions.  I note that some counties, Louth and Donegal, have an unexpectedly higher number of people on the register than in others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>When is it intended to commence Operation Freeflow?  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to respond to calls from this side of the House to introduce it early, particularly in the vicinity of the M50 where conditions are appalling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Crawford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the T&aacute;naiste would like to answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the extraordinary increases in the cost of electricity and gas, when will the protection of employment Bill be introduced to deal with redundancy issues?  As it took more than six months for a person to be cleared to become a carer, when will the register of persons who are considered unsafe to work with children be introduced so that we can discuss the issue?  Approximately one month ago I was promised that the Whips would discuss and agree when the Teamwork report would be discussed in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter was raised yesterday.  I call the T&aacute;naiste on the first two issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the report be debated?  Deputy Kehoe has raised the matter, which is extremely important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on it now.  The Deputy was doing very well on the first two issues.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="345"/>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of the Corrib gas discovery, as the crisis developed I felt strongly that we had a dearth of information.  The Advantica report, the Centre of Public Inquiry and the Minister&rsquo;s technical advisory group all showed there was a lack of fundamental information in this area.  It would be important to immediately establish an agency that would give the State an expertise in the entire exploration area.  The Natural Oil Reserves Agency Bill is an oppor<Col N="353"/>tunity to do that.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel in that regard.  We only have to see the path taken by our Scandinavian neighbours in particular, the Norwegians and the Danes.  People refer to the massive resources Norway has, and perhaps Denmark is an even more modest example, but the DONG exploration agency is a model for this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has been criticised severely regarding the Slyne-Erris round of licensing and for the entire licensing programme for this year.  There is a belief among the public that we need a full debate on that.  There is an oil exploration Bill in my name on the Order Paper and part of that Bill&rsquo;s remit would be to require the Minister to bring every licensing round before this House.  The Minister might indicate when replying whether that is a course of action he would favour.  The Labour Party would like to see ongoing <Col N="354"/>invigilation of this area.  Our Bill provides for a discussion and approval by the D&aacute;il of each licensing round and a six year look-back at the round subsequently.  We have the Indecon study and the Minister told the House last night he is still considering the possibility of having a review of the licensing terms, which he expects early next year.  That is welcome but there is a case to be made for an agency such as the one the Labour amendment proposes.  The Minister said that from what he knows now and what is beginning to become apparent from the resources available to him from different agencies, perhaps in three or four years time the establishment of an Irish exploration agency would be high on the agenda of the Minister for energy but I ask him, in view of all the controversies we have suffered over the past four or five years, to do it now.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 50 and 52 are being discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 13, line 33, after &ldquo;functions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have tabled this amendment because I feel the Minister should have to approve the hiring by the agency of consultants or advisers to help it to perform its functions.  Over the last couple of days, I have been anxious to include in the Bill extra provisions to ensure the Minister is accountable to the House.  In this instance, it would not be any harm for the Minister to have to give approval to any extension of the functions of the agency.  I would like the Minister to respond in that regard.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 52 proposes to include the words &ldquo;as determined from time to time by the Minister&rdquo;, which is an idea we have already discussed.  The inclusion of the phrase, which is quite commonly used in the drafting of legislation, might be of benefit to the Bill.  This section of the Bill is an appropriate place in which to insert it.  This provision would strengthen the Bill by placing a focus on the need for accountability, to the Minister in this case.  While I have been tempted to restrict the Minister&rsquo;s sweeping and almighty powers in all the cases so far, I want to elevate the Minister to a new role in this case.  I would like him to be able to initiate changes which are beneficial, complementary and effective in bringing meaning to this section of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not inclined to support amendment No. 50, which relates to the agency&rsquo;s power to engage consultants and advisers.  During its ongoing day-to-day work, the agency may need to hire various specialists, consultants and advisers at different times.  I do not favour this amendment, as I think it would be better to give the agency the maximum freedom possible.  While there may be more merit in amendment No. 52, it comes into the same territory as amendment <Col N="356"/>No. 50 because it might infringe on the autonomy of the agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The D&aacute;il should be responsible for this matter.  It should have to give the final approval in this regard.  I will give an example of that.  As no code of practice was provided for when the Minister gave consent to the production pipeline for the Corrib gas project, the pipeline in question is illegal.  Therefore, the company in question is able to do what it wants.  That cannot be right, clearly.  If the D&aacute;il had been given responsibility in this regard, there would have been some accountability.  No planning permission was given for the cold venting of gas, which is another issue.  Shell, which is the main promoter of the project, was not prepared to look outside Bellanaboy as a location for the terminal.  The D&aacute;il should be accountable in circumstances of this nature for the reasons I have mentioned.</P>
        <P>Given the pipeline is coming into County Mayo and taking gas from the county, and in light of the protests which have taken place, it is only equitable and fair that the pipeline will be used to bring gas to towns in the county.  That is the way I have always said it should be and that is the way it will be.  I hope the Minister will ensure that gas is brought to all the towns in County Mayo, including Belmullet and Ballinrobe, because they all deserve gas.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il should have a say in what is happening.  The Minister, who is continuing to issue licences, has said there will be no change in the terms of the licences until 2007 even though he promised, as a result of a Private Members&rsquo; motion, to provide for a review of those terms by the end of this year.  He is issuing licences and assuring those in the industry that they do not need to worry because he will not change anything until 2007.  I would like the Minister to respond to my remarks in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will stick to the amendments before the House.  I will respond to what Deputy Durkan said.  My mother used to say that if you had a dog, you should not <Col N="357"/>bark yourself.  These amendments are in that category.  There is no point in setting up a semi-State agency such as NORA to do a job within the limits set down in legislation by this House and then second-guessing it on the appointment of consultants and other issues that are the business of the company itself.  I do not think that the phrase &ldquo;as determined from time to time by the Minister&rdquo; is necessary.  It does not add anything to it.  The levy is determined by the Minister and that is catered for elsewhere.  One of these amendments represents an undue interference in the running of the company and the other amendment is not necessary because the Minister is the only person to determine the levy.</P>
        <P>It would be wonderful to get gas into the towns in Mayo that have now been approved for it.  The Deputy might try to help us to ensure that happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the points made by Deputy Broughan and by the Minister.  Deputy Broughan and I spent many years on the Committee of Public Accounts and we learned a great deal.  We learned much about allowances, remuneration and expenses for State and semi-State bodies.  Serious questions were raised in the committee about how approval was given for consultancies.  Arising from those experiences, I felt that it would be good to amend section 18(1) by adding &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo;.  I do not think there is anything wrong with that.  The Minister stated that it was provided for elsewhere when dealing with the levy, and that is true, but it is not provided for in this section.  I do not see why it should not be subject to the provisions in the other part of the Bill outlined by the Minister.</P>
        <P>We need to ensure that the Minister and the agency are responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas, which does not mean second-guessing them.  In several cases, provision is made for the Minister and the Minister for Finance to approve.  I take the point made by Deputy Broughan that it is an internal function of the industry, but I am not so certain that it is.  A consultant may advise a Minister that it is appropriate to engage a con<Col N="358"/>sultant to advise in a particular way.  Depending on who the consultant is, the whole thing might be a foregone conclusion.  There might be no way of monitoring the consultant and he or she could come up with anything.  The electronic voting system is a classic example of something that got away from us.  It took on a life of its own and nobody had any regard for it.  Public money went after public money and there was no accountability.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In this situation, there is no harm in laying down new criteria whereby we intervene on behalf of the taxpayer.  Let us stop apologising to everybody outside the House for doing so.  If we are serious about our job, we should do it that way.  We should include provisions that require ministerial approval for consultants.  If it is in some other section of the Bill but not in this section, why not?  I do not accept the notion that we should let it happen in this fashion.  There are too many occasions in which Ministers and the Houses have been hijacked by decisions taken on the basis of advice given by consultants who were employed to give an appraisal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <HtmlBk SectId="2" />
        <P FLI="0">The Minister shall ensure that a superannuation scheme approved under this section, including an amendment of the scheme, is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after it is approved.  It might be no harm to insert the words &ldquo;before it is approved&rdquo;.  It is debatable and the Minister is convulsed with mirth, but we would like to hear his invigorating response.</P>
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision, as drafted, provides that the Minister shall ensure the superannuation schemes are laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after such a scheme is approved.  Section 22 provides that either House of the Oireachtas may annul a superannuation scheme.  The text is in line with the standard provisions of legislation relating to similar State bodies and I am satisfied that the text of the Bill should remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s proposal in amendment No. 61 is not consistent with standard corporate governance requirements imposed on similar bodies.  Superannuation schemes in respect of State bodies are subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance in addition to the approval of the parent Department.  This process ensures the provisions of a scheme are in line with legislative provisions governing such schemes for the public sector.  There is no need for either amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s comments regarding amendment No. 60 and I will not press it.  The reason I tabled amendment No. 61 is that we have heard numerous expressions of concern regarding pensions, remuneration and the raiding of pension funds.  While the amendment would not prevent such activity, it would introduce a review by the Pensions Board.  Anything that could lead to a liability or a failure by the State or a State body or agency to live up its expectations would be serious.  It might be a good idea to make this amendment to protect the Minister, the State, the public and those employed by the agency in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment, which we debated on Committee Stage.  We also debated this issue yesterday while dealing with earlier amendments on the superannuation schemes.  However, Members have received many complaints from the former staff of State agencies who were initially employed in the Civil Service before the State bodies to which they were trans<Col N="366"/>ferred were established.  Consequently, the terms and conditions of their superannuation schemes were amended.  For example, pensioners attached to Dublin Port Company complain that the indexation of their pensions, which they had expected to continue, was arbitrarily withdrawn.  Deputy Durkan is seeking to provide an additional protection for the staff of the proposed new agency, who were first transferred from the Civil Service in 1995.</P>
        <P>This issue will continue to grow.  For example, in Italy and Germany, governments arbitrarily decided that public sector pensions for which they were directly responsible would be subject to different terms and conditions.  This is a concern and Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s attempt to provide for additional invigilation by the Pensions Board has merit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Public sector pensions are dealt with in this manner.  Standard corporate governance requires that the State through the Minister for Finance and the Minister of the parent Department looks after pensions and I do not propose to depart from that practice.  The best protection any pensioner can get is from the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose that the House should divide on the amendment but, as Deputy Broughan stated, complaints regarding pension schemes have been brought to the attention of Members over the past number of years.  The longer one is a Member, the more instances are brought to one&rsquo;s attention.  I am not critical of the Minister but, under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, responsibility for the postal service transferred from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to An Post.  This included an obligation to observe all the pension and remuneration entitlements that the staff who were transferring had but, unfortunately, that did not happen.  If a body such as the Pensions Board had approved the transfer at the time, we might not be in this situation.  The reason that happened is a regulation or statutory instrument was introduced to remove authority and responsibility for the obligations entered into by the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas in one fell sweep, with the staff left swinging in the air.</P>
        <P>Deputy Broughan has tabled a later amendment, which contains a nice, meaty arrangement and, therefore, while I do not propose to seek a division, I will press the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 62:</P><Col N="367"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) A code of conduct drawn up under this section shall require records of interests of persons to whom the code applies, and records of conflict of interest, to be maintained and to be opened to public scrutiny during office hours.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment relates to section 25, which deals with a code of conduct for the agency.  The section provides for proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest to be maintained by a person while performing functions as a director of the agency, a member of a committee of the agency, chief executive, a consultant or adviser employed by the agency or an employee. The second also provides that the agency should publish the code of conduct.  The Minister should go a step further and specify that the code of conduct must &ldquo;require records of interests of persons to whom the code applies, and records of conflict of interest, to be maintained and to be opened to public scrutiny during office hours&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I tabled the amendment in the interest of transparency and to prevent conflicts of interest.  Membership of the board requires experience and expertise in the oil distribution business.  Board members will have contacts within the industry and the code of conduct sets out how conflicts of interest could be avoided.  The Minister may say in reply that the code will entail records being kept, but that should be specified in the legislation to be absolutely sure.  For example, a register of Members&rsquo; interests is maintained in the office of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The same standards should be expected of other public servants such as those who will run the agency on a statutory basis.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this timely amendment, which is similar to amendments discussed in recent days.  It is not an attempt to imply any irregularity.  Rather, it is an attempt to protect the agency, the Government and the taxpayer from something unanticipated coming down the tracks.</P>
        <P>We should remember that the value of the stocks retained by the agency at any given time will be considerable, meaning the agency will have a certain amount of responsibility.  It is imperative that the highest possible standards apply in respect of potential conflicts of interest.  It would be better to stipulate such a provision in the Bill than to leave the issue to one side and suggest that all eventualities are covered by other sections and Acts.  It would protect everyone involved, including the Government.  While changes in Government may take a long time, they do occur.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="368"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 25 provides for the drafting of a code of conduct in respect of standards of integrity and concern for the public interest.  That code must apply to directors, the CEO, employees, consultants and advisers engaged by NORA and the employees of those consultants and advisers.  The code is additional to the requirements on NORA&rsquo;s directors under the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, which provides for the disclosures of interests of holders of certain public offices, designated directors of certain public bodies and persons employed in designated positions therein.</P>
        <P>The provision is specific.  Persons occupying positions prescribed in the regulations are required to furnish statements of registerable interests or, if they have none, make nil return statements.  The directors of NORA are prescribed as designated directorships under the Ethics in Public Office Act and must make annual returns under that Act.  The manager, financial controller and operations manager must also make returns under the Act.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the measure as drafted provides adequately for the protection of the public interest.  I agree we must ensure that there are no conflicts of interest or if there are conflicts of interest, that they are stated clearly and registered, but we should not impose stricter requirements on NORA&rsquo;s directors than we do on the directors of other State or semi-State companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Our records are available.  For example, anyone can check the Minister&rsquo;s, Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s, the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s or my interests.  Under this and other sections, will the same requirement apply to NORA&rsquo;s directors?  What if someone is a director of a distribution chain or is involved actively in the industry?  I tabled the amendment because it would be useful to have records, not just a code of conduct.  Our records can be found in the Oireachtas Library and can be checked at any time.  Would it not be wise to include the word &ldquo;records&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Minister&rsquo;s reply, but in light of Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s statement, will the Minister elucidate the precise procedure and mechanism to be used in the determination of what constitutes a conflict of interest?  Interpretations may vary depending on who is giving the advice.  We could all get advice to the effect that we are covered by this provision, but we must double check and second-guess matters to ensure that we do not do anything wrong.  With the best will in the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will have a good bit of work to do before 1 January to revise the record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  Ordinarily, it can be difficult to keep everyone on side, but it will be more difficult to do so in respect of an agency <Col N="369"/>with NORA&rsquo;s type of contacts.  For example, it will buy and sell on the global energy market.</P>
        <P>If the Minister responded to Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s points and elaborated on how the State would be doubly protected, it would assure the House.  People of substance must be involved at this level and one cannot impugn their integrity beforehand, but it would be no harm for everyone to be aware of the starting point and to try to aspire to the highest possible standards to protect the interests of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A balance must be maintained in these situations.  The only public servants at a similar level who must make disclosures that are open to public scrutiny are officials in, for example, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, who are involved in a process that should be open.</P>
        <P>The directors will provide a public service and the State will avail of their expertise in the areas outlined in the Bill.  A Deputy asked whether the Bill addresses adequately the matter of stockbrokers, but it would not be fair or reasonable to expect them to make public declarations of all their business before becoming directors of this State agency.  It is sufficient that the CEO, directors and so on know that they must make declarations.  The balance is correct.</P>
        <P>The only business NORA is in is the buying and selling of stocks of oil.  On what might constitute a conflict of interest, the case that comes to mind is that of a board member making decisions on where to buy or sell oil while being involved in the matter under consideration.  While I would like the maximum amount of openness and transparency, a balance between persons&rsquo; private business affairs and their provision of public service on a board must be maintained in this case.  The CEO and the directors must make returns which, while not required to be made public, will be available if a question arises.  Three out of the five employees of NORA make returns under the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 so it is well covered as it stands.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, line 38, after &ldquo;obligations&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;at the highest level required by the European Union&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This refers to Part 4 of the Bill concerning the maintenance of oil stocks and the duty of NORA in that regard.  The Bill provides that the agency maintains at all times a level sufficient to comply with the State&rsquo;s stockholding obligations and higher levels as the Minister may, by written direction, specify if he or she considers it necessary to do so for the effective performance of the agency and its functions.  That includes holding <Col N="372"/>the oil stocks itself and entering into holding contracts.</P>
        <P>We debated on Second Stage the level of stocks to be held.  The Minister responded on Committee Stage that 90 days&rsquo; worth of supplies were held, which was sufficient.  However, I felt it was important to specify the amount.  The European Union has formed the view in the past 18 months that energy is perhaps the most important issue of all.  It decided that it was, therefore, critically important to maintain oil stocks at the highest possible level.  The Minister reported that we had 108 days&rsquo; supply but I put it to him that the commissioner declared the general target to be 120 days, meaning we did not reach the overall safety levels the European Union uses.  The amendment proposes a specific reference to the European Union in the legislation.  If, in the future, a higher level of stocks were required we would then seek to comply with that.  The Taoiseach attended the recent meeting of Heads of Government on the European gas supply, relationships with Russia and North Africa and the particular difficulties with oil because of the volatility of the regions concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also discussed on Second Stage and Committee Stage the subject matter of amendment No. 71.  It proposes a sufficient internal-external holding ratio so as to ensure there are enough stocks physically held within the jurisdiction of the State if a crisis arises.  The last information the Minister gave to the House was to the effect that one third of stocks were directly under NORA&rsquo;s control, one third under the control of the oil companies and one third made up of stock tickets from Wales, Denmark and other places.  The Minister may have more up-to-date information on that.  The public would want us to ensure sufficient stocks are held within the jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the bulk or 100 days supply might be on the island and not necessarily be involved with stock tickets.  However, any oil that is waiting for us on the Continent, in Welsh ports or elsewhere in the UK would have to be brought here.  If we faced a situation of rationing or were unable to get oil stocks to the country, the internal ratio would be critical.  The Bill provides that the Minister can lay down a higher level, but I suggest that to refer to the internal-external ratio would offer an additional power to a Minister for the future.  Ordinary citizens would feel that having the oil here in the country is the most important issue.</P>
        <P>Basically, what I wanted to achieve through this amendment was for a sufficient ratio to be physically within the jurisdiction.  I did not want to put down a particular figure because the figures will obviously change.  The Minister made the important point on Committee Stage that 108 days in a major world crisis situation or during a crisis involving the main oil supply countries would give us the ability to keep the economy running for six months or more.  Nonetheless, it is important to refer specifically in the Bill to the <Col N="373"/>importance of a high internal holding.  That is what I have sought to do in this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support amendments Nos. 69 and 71 in the name of Deputy Broughan.  Reference has already been made to what the Minister said on Committee Stage with regard to the fact that adequate provisions have already been made and that we must comply with European regulations in this regard.  Notwithstanding this, we are an island nation and are somewhat isolated from the rest of Europe.  For that reason, it might be helpful to recognise that what is applicable in the rest of Europe may not suit us, particularly in the energy area and with regard to storage capacity here.  I know we have the ability to store oil in Europe also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There could come a time when, due to circumstances outside our control or that of Europe, our requirements may change.  This could happen overnight and for that reason Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendments are constructive and useful.  They would strengthen the Bill and protect the interests of the people and the country both domestically and industrially.</P>
        <P>I put forward amendment No. 70 for the same reason.  I know the Minister replied on Committee Stage and pointed out the Bill is compliant with all the European Union regulations with which we must comply.  Like everybody in the House, I am a strong European, perhaps stronger than others.  This has nothing to do with the Bill, but I would like to mention in passing that when we joined the European Union we had a healthy fishing industry.  However, it is rapidly disappearing.  Perhaps we contributed to its disappearance, given the limited scale of our activity in the area.</P>
        <P>Therefore, to those who might be critical of what Deputy Broughan and I are trying to say here, I make no apology when I point out that our circumstances may be somewhat different.  With no disrespect, perhaps the European Union, which acts in everybody&rsquo;s best interest, did not legislate sufficiently for all eventualities.  When it achieves utopia in the area, we will listen to it.  Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, the amendments are worthy and have the potential to strengthen Irish interests and requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendments are already fully catered for within the Bill.  Provision for compliance by Ireland with the EU obligation, which currently stands at 90 days, is already provided for in section 32(1)(<i>a</i>), which provides that &ldquo;The Agency shall maintain ... such oil stocks ... at &mdash; (<i>a</i>) a level sufficient to comply with the State&rsquo;s stockholding obligations&rdquo;.  That provision also addresses amendment No. 70.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 71, I am satisfied that section 33, which provides that NORA must obtain the approval of the Minister to hold stocks outside the State, adequately covers the amendment proposed by the Deputy.  The Mini<Col N="374"/>ster has the power to say that more stocks should be held on shore on this island at any stage as he or she deems prudent.</P>
        <P>I know the issue is of concern to all.  One of the long-term objectives of NORA is to increase the volume of NORA-owned stocks held in Ireland, having regard to storage availability here and value for money.  We should approach this incrementally and NORA is currently pursuing a number of options in this regard.  The objectives also require putting NORA on a sound financial footing.</P>
        <P>With regard to our oil stocks, on 1 August we had 107 days of reserves and on 1 September we had an estimated 104 days of reserves.  Of those stocks, NORA held 71 days of stocks.  Some 40 days were wholly owned by NORA and 31 days were stock tickets.  Of the total reserves, 66 days of NORA and industry stocks were held in Ireland.  I accept the Deputies&rsquo; concerns, but the amendments are unnecessary because they are fully catered for within the Bill as it stands.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have spoken on this amendment as it was discussed with amendments Nos. 69 and 71.  I will not press it, but it relates to the integrity of the storage capacity.  This whole scene is compliant with EU legislative requirements.  I remind the House that the EU is not always correct in its determinations.  For instance, the electricity grid has, to my knowledge, collapsed twice during the past 18 months, once last week and once a year ago.  We must take account of that.  Despite the best determination and the fact the service is provided over land, which is much easier than what we are trying to do here, I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Transport 21: Statements (Resumed). </Title>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the belated opportunity to speak on Transport 21, although given <Col N="377"/>the policy was announced more than one year ago, it is a shame we are only now making statements on it.  This is a sterile and futile way of discussing a policy which merits a proper debate on the enormous investments it proposes on behalf of the taxpayer.  I regret the Minister for Transport, who is responsible for Transport 21, is not here.  Given the significance of this issue for everybody in the country, he should have shown more respect to the House by at least listening to the opinion of Opposition Deputies.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael fundamentally believes there is nothing more important to this country than investing in transport infrastructure.  I disregard the advice of the ESRI to slow investment in this area because transport is crucial to the economy.  Far form causing inflation, it is necessary to invest in transport if we are to avoid inflation and remain competitive.  We simply cannot cut spending on transport.  The overruns that have arisen in major engineering projects have been a result of a lack of capacity in the economy but, since the expansion of the EU, labour has been readily available, although the need remains to strengthen project management teams and the technical and financial support required for major projects.  Given the magnitude of the investments in transport planned for the next ten years, it is essential we spend money in such a way that taxpayers receive the best possible value.</P>
        <P>While I have no problem with any of the projects proposed in Transport 21, and indeed support most of them, I know nothing about them other than their names.  Apart from having a list of projects, I know nothing about any of the projects nor does anybody else.  I do not know the cost or priority of projects.  I do not even know if anybody has a list of priorities or what informed those priorities.  I know nothing of a cost-benefit analysis, a programme of works, working budgets, tender dates or construction start dates.  We know nothing more than we knew 12 months ago when the initiative was announced.  While individual announcements have been made, we do not have any integrated sense of what is going on.  We have a list of projects with nobody managing it, although we hear we are to get some detail on the Dublin transport authority today.</P>
        <P>We are not even sure what falls into the &euro;34 billion.  For instance the metro was announced in recent weeks.  While it is on the list it does not form part of the &euro;34 billion because, as a public private partnership, we will not begin to pay for it until after 2015 when the plan expires.  While I hope the metro will be built by then, it is not part of the &euro;34 billion envelope.  While I do not want to be too critical of projects that I support, I am critical about how they are being managed.  It is not inappropriate for us to criticise the lack of information when the spend is &euro;34 billion.</P>
        <P>The bulk of this money will be spent in Dublin on public transport projects.  I have a concern, which has been mentioned by others.  The network of routes that forms the Dublin investment <Col N="378"/>was first published in 2001 before the last general election and was based on a Platform for Change, prepared by the Dublin Transportation Office and for which a cost-benefit analysis was completed.  In other words a cost-benefit analysis was carried out for the entire network of routes.  Since then major changes have been made to the plan.  Many projects have been taken out, including the Luas to serve Rathfarnham in my constituency, without any explanation.  The interconnector that was not in a Platform for Change was added.  There have been various additions, subtractions and changes.  For instance, new metro stations have been inserted and the location of stations has changed.  Major connections have been changed.  Despite those changes, which will have a huge impact on the overall feasibility of and return on the investment, no network cost-benefit analysis has been completed and as far as I am aware there is no plan to do one, which is very disturbing.</P>
        <P>The Minister talked about the importance of connectivity, with which I agree.  However, the location of connections is vital.  Making a major change, for example to move a connection to Drumcondra &mdash; everything seems to connect in Drumcondra these days &mdash; which might be the right thing to do, has a major impact on the overall costs and benefits because it impacts on the entire network and not just on that route.</P>
        <P>The Luas was savaged by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke when she took out its middle and did not join the two lines.  The impact was not just an inconvenience to passengers &mdash; happily many passengers now benefit from the service &mdash; but affected 5 million passengers each year who would have used the service had it been connected.  Not only did we get a bad return on investment, we must also always be conscious of the opportunity cost of not doing things or changing them.  We received no explanation of the decision about the Luas line to Rathfarnham and its possible impact.  Nor have we received an evaluation of the impact on the rest of the network.</P>
        <P>We need not only a network appraisal and cost-benefit analysis, but also individual cost-benefit analyses.  We are told these exist, but are being kept a secret.  Even if we knew what they were, they are being done in the wrong way because each agency is doing its own cost-benefit analysis to different objectives and criteria.  What one body regards as a benefit and will present as such when making a case for its particular investment project might be detrimental to another agency&rsquo;s project.  There is no integration or co-ordination between them.  A CIE project might be of great benefit to it, but might take passengers from Dublin Bus or another project that the RPA might have in mind.  Without overall common criteria, cost-benefit analyses are meaningless.  We are making investments without having established any good case.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 is too big an investment for secrecy.  We must make decisions based on hard <Col N="379"/>information and not on intuition.  We need transparency, openness and the hard-nosed professional cost-benefit analysis of the network and the individual projects to common criteria.  While I do not know whether this country has the technical and professional experience and know-how to complete the kind of analysis required of projects of this size, we must buy it in before we get much further with any of the projects.  For instance the metro is a very expensive project that needs the technical, professional and financial input that was never required for any previous project.  We must learn from the mistakes that were made with the port tunnel, which will end up costing twice what it should have cost.</P>
        <P>Today will see the announcement of the Dublin transport authority.  This time last year we criticised Transport 21 as being a list into which no prior preparation had been put.  It had no body to drive it forward, co-ordinate the projects or decide their priorities.  Hurriedly the Minister announced the following day that he would appoint a Dublin transport authority.  As further proof of how little thought went into it, he then asked Professor O&rsquo;Mahony to go away and come back in a few weeks to tell him what the body would do.  Twelve months later we understand the report is to be published.  We still do not have the body or the legislation and projects are proceeding.  It is no wonder that projects are proceeding without co-ordination between them.  The agencies are clamouring for favour for their particular projects.  Rows are ongoing between the agencies over, for instance, integrated ticketing and road space with Dublin Bus fighting with the RPA over road space.  These unnecessary tensions exist because no overarching body is looking after the public good rather than the good of individual agencies.</P>
        <P>The long-promised transportation authority is needed to integrate, prioritise and co-ordinate all the projects and to at least ensure they are not competing with one and other.  It needs to be strong, professional and most of all independent of the agencies to ensure the interests of consumers and not the providers are put to the fore.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the experience that has been built up in the various agencies, the CIE group, the DTO and the RPA.  I hope the best of that can be maintained in the body to be announced today.  However, we will need to bring in outside expertise for the management of major projects.  I would prefer to see someone from outside the existing agencies heading up the new body.  The DTO is the only body with experience in modelling.  It has the expertise and has completed the training.  It can provide validity to the other agencies&rsquo; projects because it is respected and known to be the only body with that modelling expertise.  It is important that expertise is not dissipated in the clean sweep that may occur.  We have not heard the detail but I hope the expertise of all the bodies can be subsumed into the new <Col N="380"/>transportation authority.  Decisions must be made on a professional basis and not on the basis of who shouts loudest.  Nor can we allow expensive projects to go ahead, as we have done in the past, simply because they have reached the stage where they have taken on a life of their own.</P>
        <P>The port tunnel is a case in point.  It may have a great purpose but nobody knows what it is.  When the eastern bypass project was dropped, the port tunnel had reached the stage where nobody could make the decision to stop it; it had taken on a life of its own.  It is now effectively serving only Dublin Port for trucks and the decision has been made to move the port, which was the justification for the tunnel in the first place.  That makes little sense, particularly when we consider other infrastructure projects that are going ahead throughout this city.  I do not know if the incinerator in Ringsend will go ahead &mdash; it is being talked about &mdash; but the tunnel is on the north side.  The two baling stations for the entire Dublin region will be on the south side.  That does not make much sense.  There is a lack of co-ordination.</P>
        <P>I understand it is planned to publish the legislation before Christmas but it must be passed and the body set up on a statutory basis as quickly as possible to ensure there is no waste in these projects, that priorities are established and that we do not have two major works as in the case of the port tunnel which, when finished, will direct traffic on to the M50 just when it is being dug up.  We need a strong body to ensure that type of scenario does not happen in the future and that we get the best value for money in projects such as integrated ticketing.  That must be a priority for the Dublin transport authority.  I ask the Minister to ensure, when he announces the details of this body today, that he moves immediately to set up a shadow authority so that the work of co-ordination, integration and prioritisation can proceed with speed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the views expressed about the purpose of this debate.  It is disappointing that the Minister has not shown up for it.  This is a major project costing a vast amount of public funding and it is a pity that he could not take the time to come into the House for the debate.  It would appear that this slot for statements on Transport 21 is more about plugging a gap in the D&aacute;il schedule and covering up the fact that the Government does not have legislation to produce than having a debate on what is required in the transport area in future years.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party welcomed the publication of Transport 21 in so far as it goes.  We welcome the approach taken in that there is a commitment to invest substantial public moneys in our transport system over a ten-year period and there is a roll-over programme in that we do not continue the stop-go approach to funding we have seen in recent years.  To that extent we welcome it, but the Labour Party has a number of reservations <Col N="381"/>about the approach taken in Transport 21 and the selection and timing of a number of the projects.</P>
        <P>There is a shocking lack of detail in the list of projects.  There are no costings on any of the individual projects.  The Minister continues to refuse to publish the traffic modelling work which underpins the Transport 21 plans.  We are told that modelling work was undertaken by the DTO but to date we have seen no evidence of that.  There does not appear to be any justification for the Minister&rsquo;s continual refusal to provide that basic information.  Members of the D&aacute;il, and the public as taxpayers, are entitled to know the basis on which the Government decided to select the projects it selected.  Why did it select certain projects over others?  What is the basis for its proposed phasing of those projects?</P>
        <P>We are talking about a massive amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money and taxpayers have the right to know the reason the Government selected those projects, whether the costs stack up, whether it makes economic sense to proceed with them and whether there are cost benefit analyses that show a positive return for the economy.  Unfortunately, there is no information on that.  Further, there is no information on the way cost overruns are to be addressed, given the bad experience in the past of major transport and other projects ending up costing multiples of what was originally estimated.  I expect the Minister would have at least examined the mechanisms that could be put in place to ensure, first, that robust cost benefit analyses were carried out at the outset and, second, that a mechanism was put in place to ensure cost overruns could be controlled as the project developed.</P>
        <P>In the past, an early cost benefit analysis was done on major projects such as this one.  At that point the estimate of the cost of the project might be X million euro but as the project went on there was no control on cost overruns.  In some cases &mdash; this applies to roads projects &mdash; the original estimates were completely off-beam.  Changes were then made to the contract, the specification was changed and so on and the project, as it proceeded, increased in cost.</P>
        <P>There does not appear to be any mechanism in place to keep those projects under ongoing review.  There is no doubt that in the case of some projects in the past, if at some point half way through the planning of a project or before the contract was awarded a cost benefit analysis was done, it may have shown a negative return on that investment.  It is a question of being careful with what are vast sums of public money.</P>
        <P>For any of the projects in the transport area, whether it is a public transport project or a roads project, we are talking about vast sums of money.  That is why there is an even greater requirement on Government to have in place mechanisms to ensure that the costs are kept in control and that there is a constant evaluation of the return to the Exchequer on that investment, right up to the point where the contract is being awarded.  So far, <Col N="382"/>however, there is no indication that any of those lessons have been learned from the past and that there are new systems in place to deal with that problem, which has been prevalent in respect of public projects in the past decade or so.</P>
        <P>The Transport 21 plan has come far too late.  We are now at the point where, on any day in the city of Dublin, one is liable to be faced with gridlock.  We are no longer talking about particular peak times in the day or year, or busy times coming up to Christmas.  There is an ongoing problem with traffic congestion throughout the day and the year.  It is a bit rich for the Government to come along, after nine years in power, with a plan to deal with congestion and transport when the problem has been allowed to deteriorate to its current point.  We know now that the average speed in Dublin is seriously declining.  The last count put average speeds at 10 mph.  Dublin Bus has highlighted that average bus speeds during the morning peak have dropped 11% in the past four years &mdash; they are now at the 12 km/h mark.  We all know that if it rains on any given day, traffic grinds to a halt.</P>
        <P>In a modern society and economy, which we claim to have, it is intolerable that we are on such a knife-edge that a little rain can bring traffic to a standstill.  It is clear that, over many years, there has been a complete lack of forward planning in respect of land use and the formation of the transport links required if houses are to be built to the extent they have been in recent years.  The Government is now attempting to play catch-up, but will do so over the next ten years.  Circumstances are bad at present and there is very little prospect that they will improve in the foreseeable future under Transport 21.</P>
        <P>While I very much welcome the inclusion of the rail interconnector proposal and the emphasis on rail transport in Transport 21, it is a serious mistake to place the rail interconnector so far down the schedule.  It is not to be in place until 2015, at the earliest.  Of all the transport projects spoken about over the past 20 years, the interconnector project is probably the most significant.  The initial investment will deliver a very significant return in terms of additional capacity and it will provide relief for the entire greater Dublin area and all the surrounding commuter counties.  It can be achieved reasonably quickly and very cost-effectively.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that, unlike private sector operations and many public sector operations, Irish Rail has delivered great improvements to date, particularly in respect of safety.  These have entailed the replacement of a vast quantity of tracks and the delivery of many new rail cars.  All the projects Irish Rail carried out over the past decade have been delivered within budget and on time.  This is a remarkable record.  Given the company&rsquo;s project management experience, which is second to none, there is no doubt that it could deliver the rail interconnector very quickly, perhaps within the next three years, if it were <Col N="383"/>afforded priority in Transport 21.  The Government&rsquo;s placing of the project at the end of the schedule is a very serious mistake and is regrettable.  It is delaying a potentially considerable expansion of rail capacity.  Irish Rail serves many thousands of commuters on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is also concerned that the Minister still has no policy whatsoever on rail freight.  From economic, environmental and social perspectives, there is an urgent need to tackle this problem.  We are all familiar with the many cities, villages and towns throughout the country that are brought to a standstill frequently because of large numbers of articulated trucks trundling through their streets which were never intended for such heavy traffic.</P>
        <P>We know from accident statistics that trucks are disproportionately involved in fatal accidents and have an environmental cost in terms of wear and tear of the roads.  The Government really needs to draw up a policy on how we can encourage industry to switch from road transport to rail freight.  There are many good reasons for doing so.  This important area has been completely ignored in Transport 21.</P>
        <P>The traffic congestion associated with the school run is very significant.  We all know how much congestion lessens in cities and towns when the schools are on holidays.  This is a critical problem and requires attention.  It is another problem that has been ignored in Transport 21.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that Transport 21 seems to reflect existing regional developmental imbalances.  Rather than act as a mechanism for rebalancing the skewed development that has featured all along the eastern seaboard at the expense of the west, Transport 21 does very little.  It reflects the mindset that has been evident in the Department of Transport over recent years to the effect that priority has been afforded to roads and train and bus routes to and from Dublin.  Adequate consideration has not been given to the need to have better connectivity between cities and towns outside the Dublin region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main criticism of Transport 21 was probably that the Government had no plan whatsoever to deliver on the various projects contained therein.  Both sides of the House have recognised for many years that we very much lack a centralised transport authority to deal with projects in the Dublin area or nationally.  There is no point announcing a long list of very expensive transport projects unless there is a body or authority charged with delivering them.  When the Minister was criticised in this regard this time last year, when he announced Transport 21, he very quickly attempted to correct his mistake.  Only after announcing a budget for the projects amounting to almost &euro;35 billion did it occur to him that he might need an authority to deliver them.  Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred to the long delays in this regard.  Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony was appointed to produce a report and gave it to the <Col N="384"/>Minister last March, yet we are only discussing it in November.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s newspapers state the Minister is to make some announcement on this matter this afternoon.  That is probably why he is not present.  It would be more appropriate for him to be in the House to tell us what he has in mind.  Some 12 months after Transport 21 was first announced, there is still no body or authority to deliver the projects.</P>
        <P>I gather from newspaper reports that the Minister is to announce a transport authority for Dublin today.  I certainly hope he has taken on board the comments and criticisms made over many years on the delivery of projects.  I hope the Dublin transport authority will have a role in respect of land use.  It makes no sense whatsoever to divorce land use from transport.  I hope there is very clear, democratic involvement by public representatives and local authorities in the authority and that it does not end up as a white elephant in terms of regulation.  It has been estimated that if a separate body such as the Dublin transport authority assumed full responsibility for the bus market, it could cost approximately &euro;35 million per year.  There should be light-touch regulation.  Dublin Bus has a very good network in place and it has expertise.  The Dublin transport authority should concern itself with benchmarking Dublin Bus&rsquo;s costs rather than setting up a new layer of administration and engaging in a very expensive regulation process.  We want a body that will deliver the projects which are planned, first and foremost.  It should also be accountable, it should have democratic involvement and it should have a clear role in land use.</P>

	<P>I am filling in for my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  When I was sitting in my office earlier today, trying to come to grips with Transport 21, I asked the people who were with me what exactly is in the plan.  One of the Green Party&rsquo;s researchers, Ms Sue Duke, said that there is nothing in it.  That sums it up, in essence.  There is nothing in Transport 21 &mdash; it is a case of smoke and mirrors.</P>
        <P>When I recall the transport debates which took place in Dublin ten, 15 and 20 years ago, I remember that substantial plans, with timetables and costings, were proposed at that time.  There was clarity rather than the puff of smoke that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, seems to leave around him every time he makes an announcement.  The Government will be remembered for its guff and fluff &mdash; statements which mean nothing and promises which have not been delivered on &mdash; rather than for its completion of infrastructural projects.</P><Col N="385"/>
        <P>The Navan rail link, for example, was promised on the eve of the election in 1997 and again in 2002, but it has not been delivered.  It was promised again during the by-election campaign in County Meath a couple of years ago.  When I stood on the rail bed of the Navan line last Saturday, I noticed that grass was growing up through the tracks.  The railway station in the heart of Navan is boarded up.  The Minister for Transport believes all our problems will be solved if we develop motorways left, right and centre.  He is proposing to build motorways to the north, south, east and west of us, including in the Tara-Skryne valley.  At least two thirds, if not four fifths, of the transport capital funds are being invested in roads.  Rather than providing for sustainability, the Minister is deceiving himself about what will benefit Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has recently discovered an interest in the works of Mr. Robert Putnam, particularly <i>Bowling Alone,</i> but he does not understand the point that Mr. Putnam makes.  The manner in which Fianna F&aacute;il is building this country is leading to social isolation and the breakdown of families.  It is forcing people to commute to and from their places of work for up to four hours a day.  The Government, which should be building communities in which people are closer together, is helping to create the problems I have mentioned.  People should be within walking distance of churches, shops and pubs, but instead they are being shoved into their cars morning, noon and night.  That is the essence of what Fianna F&aacute;il is doing wrong in its transport policy.  One can set aside the lack of costings and clear economic analysis of its plans because the real problem is that Fianna F&aacute;il believes that our traffic problems will be solved by the construction of more roads.</P>
        <P>I implore the Government to rediscover the dusty old volumes produced by the Dublin transportation initiative over ten years ago.  I was privileged to sit on one of the initiative&rsquo;s committees.  Even now, the Government is not delivering on what was proposed back then.  It is unable to join the two Luas lines in the centre of Dublin.  It cannot do any more than talk about the great things it will do if it is given the time to do them.  The Government has been in office for the best part of the last generation, but it has yet to sort out the traffic problems in Dublin.  I ask the Government to re-examine its public transport strategy.  It should consider buying sufficient buses to fill the empty bus lanes in Dublin so that people can enjoy a reliable and efficient public transport service.</P>
        <P>The Government should reflect on the success of the Luas, which has carried an untold number of people safely, cleanly and efficiently to date.  It should try to repeat that success elsewhere in Dublin and in other towns around Ireland.  I saw a paraplegic man on the Luas the other day.  He was operating his wheelchair with a stick in his mouth.  He is able to get on the Luas, go where <Col N="386"/>he wants and come back again.  The development of the Luas has given that man some freedom.  We need more services like the Luas, which has been a huge boost not only for people with disabilities, but also for parents who are trying to bring their children to and from the city centre and for older people who find it hard to get on and off buses.  We need more systems now like the Luas, such as the proposed metro system.</P>
        <P>Every time there is a damned announcement of a new plan like Transport 21, Platform for Change or whatever is the flavour of the month, I am reminded of the need for the Government to get off its high horse and do the work that is needed.  Rather than pontificating about what needs to be done, it should deliver the services that are needed.  I ask Ministers to read about what is going on abroad.  It makes much more sense to invest in public transport than in roads, particularly in urban areas.  The thinking in this regard has moved on since the era of Se&aacute;n Lemass.  The current debate is about the type of public transport in our cities, rather than about the construction of new roads to solve the problem.</P>

	<P>A television advertisement that has been running for a while shows a man pulling up in his car to ask an elderly country man for directions.  At the end of the advertisement, the elderly man tells him: &ldquo;If I was going there, I would not start from here.&rdquo;  Such a comment could be applied to this country&rsquo;s transport difficulties &mdash; if one was looking on from afar, one would not want to start from here.  The level of congestion and overcrowding on our roads has never been as bad.  Members of the bus unions in Dublin have told me about the problems they face in trying to get from A to B at certain times of the day and year.</P>
        <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell spoke about the difficulties of many people in getting to school.  We do not seem to be able to tackle the many problems of this nature.  The work being done on our roads network is adding to these problems.  Many people in my constituency are suffering as a result of the state of the M50, which is a giant car park.  This is an issue that divides people.  The lucky people who are not stuck in traffic every day do not really understand the grief and frustration experienced every morning, day in day out, by those who are trying to get on with their lives by going to work, dropping the kids to school or going to the shops but instead face the difficulties I have mentioned.</P>
        <P>There are some good proposals in Transport 21.  My colleague, Deputy Cuffe, spoke about the redevelopment of the derelict Navan railway line.  There is enough money in the country to fund such reconstruction of infrastructure.  The pursuit of that proposal is way down the track, however &mdash; no pun intended.  In the case of the western rail corridor, which is in the local area of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the existing line is there to be <Col N="387"/>developed.  It seems that we will not actually move ahead with it for another ten, 20 or 30 years, which does not make sense to me.  The development of the Navan line would assist many people in the Meath-Dublin area who have to cope with the giant car parks I have mentioned.  Their lives would be transformed overnight if we were to use the available infrastructure to its full potential, but that is not being done.  We are continuing to facilitate the private car as a means of transport, rather than seeking to address the overall problems in this regard.</P>
        <P>Greater emphasis needs to be placed on public transport.  Other speakers have referred to the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of a further 100 buses for Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath as an example of the Government&rsquo;s success in this area.  This is another example of delays in keeping a promise.  We were told that the delays were caused by the desire of the Progressive Democrats to privatise a larger section of the bus market.  Many difficulties are continuing while people are crying out for more public transport.  It is ridiculous that people have to sit in lanes of traffic while bus corridors are not being used.</P>
        <P>Some Members spoke about the Luas.  I tried to take the Luas on Sunday night and the machine at the station gave me a ticket.  However, the service stops at 11.30 p.m, which is ridiculous.  Sixty people were standing at the tramway in Abbey Street and the machine kept churning out tickets on receipt of money, but the intelligent sign system was not working and did not inform us what was going on.  Such a vital piece of infrastructure should be used until 2 a.m or even 3 a.m. when people need it.</P>
        <P>There is an over-reliance on trucks and less freight is being moved by rail.  There is a possibility of using rail for freight from our ports and this might take some of the HGVs off our already congested roads.  For truck drivers who currently transport our valuable freight, it is unacceptable that proper facilities and services are unavailable on motorways.</P>
        <P>I do not see any major improvements coming from this incompetent plan that is being put forward.  In fact, things look like they will get worse.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>If delivery of all components of the public transport element of Transport 21 in Dublin and the surrounding counties occurred in the next couple of years, there would be reason for optimism about the current crisis.  However, the more critical components are ten years&rsquo; away, such as the interconnector that will remove 750,000 daily commuters from the roads.  I have been in favour of the interconnector for years as a former member of panels of the Dublin transportation initiative and the Dublin Transportation Office.  I have never understood why it has such a low priority given the benefit it would bring.  Money spent expanding our rail network, especially in urban areas, is a very solid strategic <Col N="388"/>investment as long as it is spent in the right location and the costs are reasonable.  A decent cost-benefit analysis of these must be made.  There has been a significant shortage of specifics for many of the projects outlined in Transport 21, even though most of them have merit.</P>
        <P>Given that these serious investments will be in the long term, my concern is what can be done in the short term.  I was appalled by recent developments.  There is an emergency every day for many people and the only response is bus-based.  About 14% of public transport use is by bus while 4% is by rail.  This is obviously due to the extent of the rail available and the bus is clearly the work horse of the public transport system.  However, we only got 100 buses this year when 200 were proposed following a network review.</P>
        <P>On 3 May 2006, the Minister for Transport informed the D&aacute;il that he wanted to see not alone the 200 buses required going to Dublin Bus, but the private sector adding significantly to the capacity.  However, there was a row between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il over the summer and the number was reduced to 100 buses.  The other 100 buses will be considered when the new transport authority is in place.  The legislation to develop this authority will probably not be brought before the Houses until the autumn of next year, so it is likely that the other 100 buses will not be added until 2008.</P>
        <P>In a written reply to a parliamentary question, I was told that 27 licences were issued to private operators for new routes under the 1932 Act.  I was also told that there is no obligation on any of those operators to have integrated ticketing, which is part of Transport 21.  Instead of a coherent service, we are getting further fragmentation.  I live in an area which has two providers and the routes coincide in locations.  There are separate bus stops, separate timetables and separate ticketing.  One has to stand between the two bus stops and decide which one is coming.  What happens if a dozen operators exist in the same place?  There will be nothing but chaos.  We are going back to a pre-1932 scenario.  Private bus providers must negotiate with Dublin City Council and the Garda for a city centre bus stop and terminal space, and such spaces are at a premium.</P>
        <P>Instead of hundreds of new buses and a whole range of new routes, especially in areas where there are thousands of new homes, we are getting a fragmented approach.  Services such as feeder buses and parking spaces go hand in hand to encourage rail use.  The Maynooth rail service is called the Calcutta express, which describes it very well.  People come from Longford and Enfield and park in the streets and housing estates of Maynooth.  Nobody wants to live there because it has become absolutely intolerable.  These are short-term issues that must be examined.  Some bins are not being collected and emergency vehicles are not getting in and out.</P>
        <P>The train service on the Maynooth line is so overcrowded that it has become dangerous. <Col N="389"/> There is some additional rolling stock intended for delivery, but that needed to happen years ago.  There are eight stations after Maynooth, but one cannot get a seat at that stage.  One can get a seat on the peak-time trains on the Kildare line in Celbridge if one gets on at the back of the train.  The people at the front of the train are those who make the hundred-yard dash for the Luas.  That is how people are living their lives.  We must provide a public transport system that makes it attractive for people to leave their cars at home.</P>
        <P>In regard to the institutional arrangements, will we see a repeat of the creation of the National Roads Authority over which there is no democratic control?  The authority must be elected and delivery is a key element.  The big impediment to the M50 is the addition of heavy goods vehicles following their removal from the city centre.  This will turn every road network outside the M50 into total gridlock.  Something can be done about this if the Government lifts the tolls, but there is no commitment to do it.  There is an emergency out there so we need to see an emergency response.  It must be part of Transport 21, but I do not see it.</P>

I am always happy to follow Deputy Catherine Murphy because when she mentions every street in her constituency, it means I can mention Tallaght the odd time.  Many of us note that Deputy Olivia Mitchell finds it possible to support some of the Minister&rsquo;s work.  I was driving into work today &mdash; sometimes I cannot use the Luas &mdash; and I was following a bus into which I nearly crashed.

I come from a bygone era in Dublin and I remember horses, trams and going back and forth to Crumlin on the bus service.  I knew Crumlin in a different era to the Deputy.</P>
      
        <P>I understand the challenges of public transport, and there is no question that there have been many positive developments recently.  I admit that on some days I must drive in to attend the House owing to other business.  There are undoubtedly challenges regarding the roads and this morning I found it difficult to get into the city centre.</P><Col N="390"/>
        <P>There are several answers and public transport is certainly one.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know that I suffered a health scare some seven years ago and the cardiac rehabilitation unit in Tallaght would always wish me to point out that we should all be walking as much as possible.  Like everyone else, I fail to walk enough.  However, I try, and I also endeavour to use public transport.  I am glad there has been so much progress in that regard in the Dublin region and the city.  I find the Minister&rsquo;s plans very exciting.</P>
        <P>Some Members will be aware that I live in Tallaght, the third-largest population centre in the country.  I represent Dublin South-West, which includes not only Tallaght but such rural areas as Brittas and Bohernabreena, as well as other urban areas such as Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills.  Many people talk about transport and while some of those areas are extremely well served, others are not.  I do not know the degree of frustration felt in trying to secure public transport in Wexford, but even in a major population centre such as Tallaght, we suffer difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Luas service has been absolutely tremendous.  I was glad to note during the week that the number of Luas passengers on the red line had reached 50 million, a tremendous boost to my town.  People are clearly using the service to enter the city from Tallaght, but many others are going out to Tallaght.  I have always made the point that it needs that transport infrastructure, since there are many things that people can do.  They can visit the Square, the civic centre, the National Basketball Arena, the hospital, and all the facilities that one would expect.  Transport infrastructure should keep pace.</P>
        <P>I was absolutely delighted the Government was able to announce the extension of the Luas service beyond the Square to the Tallaght west estates, Saggart and Citywest.  I am often in Citywest, which is just outside my constituency.  The crowd at the Ard-Fheis proved yet again how Citywest can attract such conferences, something I expect to continue.  People will be able to come from the country and other parts of the city, jump on the Luas, go through Tallaght, stop for a few minutes and go out to such places as Saggart and Citywest.  It is a good use of public transport, and the Minister should be applauded in that regard.</P>
        <P>Like other colleagues, I am unable to understand why Dublin Bus keeps telling us that the success of Luas in my region means it cannot develop its services further.  I ask the Minister of State to make that point to the Minister.  I contact Dublin Bus every day about bus services in Tallaght.  I remind Members that it is the third-largest population centre in the country, with a great many new communities having sprung up even in the last five or six years, but one cannot get a bus.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus maintains that the success of Luas means it cannot develop bus services.  That is absolute nonsense.  I am no marketing expert, but <Col N="391"/>I can see the worth of developing a service around the Luas.  One could jump on a bus in an estate such as Westbrook or any other in west Tallaght, Ballycullen or Kiltipper Road.  Many people from outside Tallaght have come because they have heard the good news about it.  Now they find getting public transport, especially peak-time buses, challenging.  Dublin Bus should sort the matter out and do something positive.</P>
        <P>The first thing I do every Thursday morning is read the <i>Tallaght Echo</i>.  Today, there is a story about Firhouse, which is not a new community.  It has been there for ever, and those houses that need bus services are well established.  However, they cannot get a decent service at any time of the day, particularly peak hours, whether they wish to go into the city centre, the college or the Square in Tallaght.  I am delighted with the progressive attitude shown by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and it is important that we support that and work through the issues.  However, that is really not good enough and regardless of whether we wish to be positive in any discussion on Transport 21, we must also say that something needs to be done.</P>
        <P>I hope my constituency receives plenty of the shiny new buses when they arrive, since many people are using them.  When Deputy Crowe spoke, he reminded me that we two are colleagues on the community bus forum, which is based in Killinarden in Tallaght.  Each month we meet the garda&iacute;, the local authority, community groups and Dublin Bus management and unions to ensure the safety of bus services.  I made a commitment to it that at every available opportunity I would make the point that new buses must be provided to Tallaght and elsewhere in the Dublin region.  Other colleagues will talk of their regions, but I wish to make the case for mine.</P>
        <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know that the Minister has facilitated us on several occasions when through Adjournment debates and other D&aacute;il business we raised the threat to bus services in such places as Tallaght.  I am always sensitive about the fact that Tallaght is no different from anywhere else.  My colleagues, Deputies Mulcahy and Martin Brady, represent areas that are also often picked on regarding such issues.</P>
        <P>The communities in our areas are absolutely entitled to a bus service.  Where people break the law, act like morons and threaten the bus service, the company and unions should not give in to them.  The last thing we should do is withdraw bus services from any community.  Whatever the problems, they should be dealt with and Dublin Bus has a particular obligation to work in conjunction with garda&iacute; and the community to ensure buses keep running.</P>
        <P>I will never accept a situation where, simply because people threaten buses or crews, which I absolutely condemn, we allow the bus service to be withdrawn.  That is the last thing we should be <Col N="392"/>doing.  That should not happen in O&rsquo;Connell Street or anywhere in the Dublin region.  I hope I have the support of the House and the Minister for Transport in saying that.  I hope the Minister of State will take a note of this and relate my stance to the Minister, Deputy Cullen.  I will continue to make that point, and I will never give in on the subject.</P>
        <P>There are things that one must say and criticisms one can level.  However, I have been particularly energised by the Minister&rsquo;s work on Transport 21.  We are headed in the right direction.  I have reached an age where I am no longer able to walk to Tallaght every day, but I am happy to use public transport and we should be doing everything possible to support it.  I look forward to giving the Minister my continued backing.  He is doing a good job and, despite what some people say, delivering daily.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>He mentioned Tallaght 25 times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on a very important initiative and say in praise that work on the M1 from Dublin to Belfast, which is linked to my county, Monaghan, through Ardee, is an example of how proper infrastructure can transform opportunities for us.  The M1 and, one hopes, the port tunnel will facilitate those in the north east getting into Dublin to do their business.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on tolling, an issue raised several times in the House recently.  Only this Monday, I travelled from Monaghan via the M1 toll bridge, and, using Eazy Pass, I was able to drive through at approximately 25 mph to 30 mph, slowing down enough to allow the machine to work.  However, when I went through the M50, the machine had to wait until the toll bar had gone up and down twice.  In this day and age, how can they not transfer the services available on the M1 to the M50, which is a much busier road, thus encouraging people to use an Eazy Pass system?  There is something scandalously wrong when such a matter cannot be dealt with in a simple way.</P>
        <P>Another issue about which I become annoyed on driving into the city revolves around empty bus corridors.  I do not understand why people should be obliged to sit in their cars on roads that are jammed with traffic while the bus lanes on those roads remain empty.  Those involved in operating the Dublin transport system must give consideration to this matter.  If one considers the position in Canada and other countries throughout the world, one will discover that ways to circumvent this problem have been found.</P>
        <P>In Canada, for example, vehicles containing three or more people are entitled to use bus lanes.  If park and ride facilities were available along the M50, many people could park on the outskirts and use buses to travel into the city.  This would ease many of the traffic jams in the city.  These are simple initiatives and it is impossible to <Col N="393"/>understand why the Government does not take action in respect of them.  I understand that Operation Freeflow will come back into effect in the coming days.  If action such as that to which I refer was taken, traffic would be much more free-flowing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the extension of the M1 towards the Border.  I wish to comment on a number of issues relating to the Border in light of the St. Andrews Agreement and on the possibility of funding from the UK and Irish Governments in this regard.  One of the best ways to cement the agreement and the entire peace process in place is to create an environment in which transport can move, industry can prosper and tourism is given an edge.</P>
        <P>There is an urgent need to exert pressure at European level to ensure that the transport link between Belfast and Carlisle, which provides road access to England and, beyond it, Europe, is improved.  The road from Stranraer to Carlisle is totally unacceptable as a trans-European link.  It is the Government&rsquo;s job to press, within EU structures, for it to be upgraded.</P>
        <P>The figure of &euro;34.4 billion sounds impressive, but I am concerned about the lack of transparency and information regarding the costings involved with Transport 21.  The Minister indicated that it is becoming the practice for many new roads to be completed on budget and ahead of schedule.  The Monaghan bypass came to public notice for more than one reason, but on the day it was opened it was not finished.  When the figures relating to the construction of this road are totted up, I am certain that it will not be on budget.  It is actually impossible to discover what is the budget in respect of the Monaghan bypass.</P>
        <P>It is more than ten years since Monaghan County Council proceeded with plans for three bypasses at Carrickmacross, Castleblayney and Monaghan town.  This shows the importance of proper strategic planning.  The council was condemned at the time for employing consultants to oversee all three projects.  However, the Carrickmacross bypass is completed, the part at Monaghan town is usable and the Castleblayney road is well on track.  The only matter to which I would refer in respect of the latter is the hesitation on the part of the Government, through the county councils, to deal fairly with property owners.</P>
        <P>The cost of property has increased dramatically in recent years, but old systems are still being used to finalise property deals.  Many people are extremely annoyed about that fact.  As the budget approaches, I beg the Government to take action to replace the commitments it gave at the last election to the former president of the IFA &mdash; he is now Minister of State at the Department of Finance &mdash; Deputy Parlon, that funding from the roll-over tax would be made available.  This never happened because the tax was discontinued.</P><Col N="394"/>
        <P>I emphasise the need for the N2 to be continued through Emyvale.  I understand that progress is being made in this regard.  However, in light of the peace process, we must ensure that North-South institutions work together to continue that road through Tyrone and on to Derry.  The latter is the fourth largest city on the island of Ireland and the N2 link is vital not just for the sake of Dublin and Derry, but also for that of north-west Donegal.  It is vital that the action I have outlined is taken.</P>
        <P>The Government must state clearly how it will work with UK and Northern Ireland political personnel on projects relating to all cross-Border routes.  I refer here to national primary roads that run from north to south and east to west.  The road from Belfast to Galway through Monaghan must be made a priority, as must the extension to the Belfast-Sligo route.  It is over 20 years since the latter was extended to Dungannon, but it has never been extended to Enniskillen and places further west.  Matters of this nature must be dealt with in the current discussions.  The road from Dundalk through Cullaville to Castleblayney includes the dangerous Ballynacarry Bridge.  It is vital that this fairly short link is upgraded to ensure that it is made safe and that lives are saved.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers referred to the good old days.  I am old enough to remember the railway line that ran through my family&rsquo;s farm.  That line was completely removed.  However, a line to Kingscourt in Cavan remains in place but the section of it that runs into Monaghan is closed.  It is scandalous that this line is not included under Transport 21.  There is a proposal to bring it to Dunboyne and eventually on to Navan.  The railway line to Kingscourt, with park and ride facilities provided, could transform the lives of many people who are obliged to commute to and from Dublin and ease the pressure on their families.</P>
        <P>The situation relating to rail infrastructure in the north west is unacceptable.  There are no railway lines in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh or Donegal.  I suggest that, at the very least, a feasibility study be carried out in this regard to ensure that value for money is obtained.</P>
        <P>The N3, which runs from Dublin to Navan, Cavan and on through Fermanagh to Donegal, is a vital link and it must be given priority.  The latter does not appear to be the case at present.  A number of Oireachtas colleagues met representatives of Cavan County Council recently and were informed that major delays continue to obtain in respect of the Belturbet section of that road, on which many deaths have occurred in recent years.  There is also a delay on the Meath section of the Virginia bypass.  It is vital that such matters are dealt with and resolved.  I understand that the Castleblayney bypass will be a three-lane road, with two lanes on one side and one on the other.  The relevant authorities are considering making the Virginia bypass a four-lane road, which is vital.  Many questions arise in respect of the three-<Col N="395"/>lane model and I am glad that the Virginia bypass, even if its completion is delayed, is constructed as a four-lane road.  The N3 is extremely important because it provides access to Cavan, Enniskillen and Donegal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The situation relating to Enniskillen is important in the context of the St. Andrews Agreement.  There is an urgent need for a bridge across the Erne there to release the traffic.  If that was done, it would leave enormous potential for different routes to be considered as the best route for an east-west road from Dundalk along the route of the old railway line.  I urge that, in discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities, the matter would be dealt with sympathetically.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an opportunity to cement the Good Friday Agreement and what is now known as the St. Andrews Agreement.  I urge the Government, in the next few days &mdash; not months &mdash; to ensure that it comes forward publicly with whatever form the proposed package will take and state clearly what funds and infrastructure will be involved.  Obviously, it will include the likes of the Ulster Canal, but that will not come under Transport 21.  These issues are vital and could be the means of bringing forward and cementing a lasting peace, for which many of us have yearned long before we ever entered this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s permission, I will share my time with Deputy Callanan.</P>
        <P>I also congratulate the Minister and the Government on Transport 21.  I was privileged to attend its launch this time last year in Dublin Castle.  It is an ambitious plan and I believe it will be implemented.</P>
        <P>I call on members of the Opposition to stop mealy-mouthing this plan.  I am not saying the previous speaker did, but, in general, there has been a mealy-mouth response to it.  They should get behind it because the public, by and large, want this ambitious plan implemented in the national interest.</P>
        <P>There are a few key points I wish to make about the plan.  There is no point going over all the detail of it, although I congratulate my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, on mentioning Tallaght at least 22 or 24 times.  I will not mention Ballyfermot, Crumlin or Drimnagh 24 times.  I just reiterate the good news that there is a new Luas line planned for Lucan which will go through Ballyfermot.  The Minister is looking at a feasibility study for a Luas line to Terenure.  There is good news for my constituency, but I do not really want to speak about that today.</P>
        <P>I wish to address a recent controversy on transport.  The ESRI stated a few days ago that we have all this money and all these plans, but if we try to do it all too quickly, we might raise inflation which could be problematic.  I wish to give my rebuttal clearly here to the ESRI &mdash; the public is impatient for the implementation of this plan. <Col N="396"/> The public does not want to wait until the next recession before being able to drive to the west quickly.  The public does not want to wait another ten years for proper commuter facilities to the suburbs.  The public does not want to wait until the next recession for a metro line to the north of this city and for the western corridor to be completed.</P>
        <P>The public has been given a schedule with this plan.  I have the schedule, covering from 2006 to 2015, that was given out last year and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to convey in the strongest possible terms the support of the House to the Minister for Transport to get on with this job and not be deflected by any mealy-mouthing from the Opposition or, indeed, from any negative criticism by the ESRI.  This schedule is a good and ambitious one and it should be stuck to.</P>
        <P>I agree with one point, which is made sometimes by members of the Opposition and sometimes by people on this side of the House.  We should not go overboard on road tolling.  There is a place for road tolling, but it should not be used everywhere.  If one examines the finances of the State, there are large surpluses running and there is a large sum of money in the pension reserve fund.  There is a strong argument to be made for using some of those capital resources to finish those road projects rather than giving those projects out to toll companies.  I have no ideological hang-up about toll companies and, as I stated, they have their place, but let us not litter every highway with a tolling scheme.  Let us use some of our capital resources to finish this project.</P>
        <P>More generally, the disability issue should be given top priority in the Transport 21 plan.  It is absolutely unacceptable that there are still buses which are inaccessible to the disabled in this city and in the suburbs.  We should give a strict timetable whereby every bus in the State is fully accessible to the disabled.  I led a campaign to make one of the Ballyfermot bus routes accessible to the disabled.  In that area, there was a lady who had not been out of her house in ten years because she could not get on to a bus and that is unacceptable.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister the message to put this matter at the top of the agenda.  It will not happen overnight.  Nothing happens overnight.  One must be realistic, but I would like to think that in two or three years there would be a public announcement by the Minister that every bus, rail, DART, Luas and metro facility in the State is fully accessible to the disabled.  In that regard, let us be ambitious, set ourselves a timeframe and, hopefully, live up to it.</P>
        <P>This is only possible because of the economic progress.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, stated at the launch of Transport 21 that one of the assumptions of the plan is that the economy will grow over the medium term at close to its potential rate and that this implies an average real growth rate of approximately 4.5%.  It <Col N="397"/>is important that we keep the economy on track because if the economy is not doing well, it will not be possible to implement this transport plan.  For that reason, I pay tribute to the Government in general for having an economy where this plan is feasible.  I commend the Minister and I commend the plan and wish it well for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 involves investment in transport infrastructure of in excess of &euro;34 million over the ten-year period that covers the areas of national roads, public transport and regional airports.  Never in my lifetime have I seen such investment in infrastructure and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the Government in this regard.</P>
        <P>This investment is shared all over the country.  No matter where one drives at present, one will see significant programmes on our roads.  County Galway shares this progress.  The completion of the Loughrea bypass, a 4 km single carriageway, is a considerable asset to the town and I thank those involved.  At present, there are many other schemes, such as the Galway city outer bypass, which is progressing to CPO and which is expected to proceed in 2006 at a cost of &euro;3 million.  The N6, between Galway and Ballinasloe, is being developed as a PPP project.  The site clearance contracts have been procured and commenced in September 2006.  The N6, between Athlone and Ballinasloe, is also in the planning stages.  As I drive home, there is already a motorway to Kinnegad and I understand in January it will extend to Kilbeggan.  We will carry on then with the upgrade of the N6, to Athlone and Ballinasloe.  This will mean that the time involved in getting from the west to Dublin will be cut considerably.  I am delighted with this; I never thought this type of roadway would be built in my lifetime.</P>
        <P>On the Galway to Tuam road, the An Bord Plean&aacute;la hearing on a carriageway providing a bypass of Tuam concluded on 25 April and a decision is awaited.  A CPO was published in 2005 for the N17 Castletown project, which involves the realignment and removal of poor junctions north of Tuam.</P>
        <P>The Milltown to Mayo boundary project, involving 8 km of two-lane carriageway, is at the planning stage.  The route selection report for the Athlone to Gort 27 km high quality dual-carriage is nearing completion, with investigations taking place at present.  The Gort to Crusheen project is 22 km long and 50% of this would be in County Clare.  However, a second entrance to Gort is crucial to that development.  The current proposal, which provides for only one entrance, is not adequate.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P>I congratulate the Government on the western rail corridor.  Many commentators said this was a dead duck and it would not be re-opened.  However, work has commenced and I congratulate everybody involved.  It will open up the west and allow isolated areas to come to the fore.  Plots <Col N="398"/>of land have been bought up near the stations on the old line and I am delighted the corridor is being re-opened.</P>
        <P>The Ennis-Athenry section involves the introduction of scheduled train services between Limerick and Galway, the enhancement of existing commuter services between Ennis and Limerick and the development of the Galway commuter rail service between Galway and Athenry.  This phase, with a capital cost of &euro;106.5 million, involves the upgrading of 36 miles of track and associated infrastructure, the elimination of approximately 125 farm-accommodation crossings and the provision of five stations at Gort, Ardrahan and Craughwell on the Ennis-Athenry line, Sixmilebridge on the Limerick-Ennis line and Oranmore on the Athenry-Galway line.</P>
        <P>Seven services a day in each direction are proposed between Limerick and Galway targeting commuters, as well as providing links to Intercity services from both cities.  Construction is expected to commence in 2007 and the Government is on track to meet that target.  The provision of new stations at Gort, Ardrahan, Craughwell, Oranmore and Sixmilebridge will facilitate more sustainable commuting patterns between these expanding satellite centres and Galway and Limerick.  The project will also provide incentives for more sustainable and efficient land use planning by local authorities.  In the context of considerable population growth projected for the area, the development of stations in existing centres should also facilitate improved land use planning on the part of the relevant local authorities.  It will give commuters a strong rail link between Limerick and Galway, the country&rsquo;s third and fourth largest cities, and a key corridor under the national spatial strategy.</P>
        <P>Those of us in the west used to look to Dublin a few years ago and say all the work was being provided there but we are delighted the tiger is moving towards the west and investment is taking place in roads between Dublin and Galway.  I compliment everybody involved and I look forward to the opening of the western rail corridor and the completion of the dual carriageway between both cities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Transport 21.  While I am delighted I am following another western Member, I cannot manage the same level of congratulation regarding the prospects or achievements of Transport 21.  Those of us who welcomed investment in transport infrastructure reasonably asked questions regarding the relative allocations under Transport 21.  A more specific commitment to public transport is needed compared with the commitment to the road network.  I wish to be constructive, irrespective of which Government takes decisions in this regard.  It is revelatory that, while we have a National Roads Authority, we do not have a national transport <Col N="399"/>authority.  If such an authority were in place, it could be reasonably assumed it would deal with multimodal forms of transport.</P>
        <P>Transport issues are not solely based on commercial factors nor are they simply defined in terms of time.  Inevitably, all transport decisions are structured within the two parameters of time and space but a rights dimension to such decisions must be respected.  A person who is too young, old or infirm to drive a car or who cannot afford a car has the right to communicate with other people.  If it is accepted that one has a right to be in communication in one&rsquo;s society, this right should be implemented in a multimodal way.  People walk, cycle, use taxis, drive private cars and take the train or bus.  The clearest fact staring us in the face is that it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest, globally and domestically, to reduce the priority given to the private car in transport planning and to provide a greater space for pubic transport, through investment in buses, trains, taxis and multiple occupancy in private cars.  This is important not only for the soundest environmental and ecological reasons but it also makes a great deal of sense in regard to waste.</P>
        <P>I have had the honour of representing Galway for a long time and we are on the verge of a disastrous decision on public transport in the city.  Given the lack of a national transport authority, I wish Members from the west would support an integrated regional approach to transport.  There should be a regional transport authority to deal with, for example, Galway city and county.  The previous speaker outlined a litany of road improvements in County Galway.  However, Ceannt Station in Galway City sits on a 14-acre site.  A former Minister for Transport wrote to CIE requesting an audit of its land so excess land could be sold.  The 14-acre site in Galway is desperately needed to provide a hub for an integrated regional transport solution for the west.  I agree with the previous speaker who was correct to welcome the development of the Sligo-Limerick connection.  However, if commuter traffic by rail and bus increases, which is also welcome, bus lanes are introduced in Galway city and Connemara is linked to the other side of County Galway, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann needs to retain ownership of that site to provide a proper terminus in the city.  Currently, people using bus services struggle with their cases as they enter the station without shelter from the rain because they are fighting for space with people who have alighted from trains and are leaving the station.  It is primitive in terms of its under provision.</P>
        <P>An additional track will be laid to Galway and five or six bus bays will be added but it has been suggested the remainder of the site will be sold for retail and residential development, which is not needed in the city centre.  A study was conducted, which highlighted that the last thing the city needs is another significant retail establishment because it would be developed at the cost <Col N="400"/>of retail activity in satellite towns such as Tuam and Athenry.  It is outrageous that there is no public discussion about a regional integrated approach to transport.  Only two public meetings have been held and they were organised by the Labour Party.  One was held in Oranmore and the other in the Great Southern Hotel, Galway, as a result of which it was proposed to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of a light rail proposal.  Following that meeting, I wrote to the Minister for Transport.  The Minister responded by stating that because such a proposal was not included in Transport 21, he had no intention of funding it.  I received the same answer to a follow-up parliamentary question.  Galway City Council passed a unanimous resolution asking for a study to be done on a light rail project, but it was refused.  I welcome the possibility of CIE&rsquo;s involvement in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is important for those of us with an interest in transport in the west to realise that more bus lanes are needed in Galway city.  It is pathetic that a Minister of State opened an extension to a bus lane instead of granting permission for more lanes.  An integrated multimodal transport provision is needed.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Callanan on another aspect, that is, if such a provision were made, stations were linked and there was a proper terminus, one would increase options for families who want to live near the new towns, reduce the amount of time a person spends locked in a car and make possible all sorts of educational opportunities.  Balanced and better provisions relieve urban diseconomies and use rural infrastructure better.  All of this is possible if there is proper planning, but nothing in Transport 21 refers to a regional approach to transport, a regional or national transport authority or whether priority will be given to public transport options, and whether the ratio between buses and rail services on the one hand and roads on the other will be changed.</P>
        <P>Regarding the outrageous disposal of public property, CIE is not a property development company.  Under the transport Acts, it is a public transport company and it is for this purpose that it owns land and sites across the country.  The onus is on CIE to show what is surplus to public transport needs, but there has been no attempt to do so.</P>
        <P>One lives with the real fear that sites in the ownership of CIE, the statutory public transport authority, will be sold on the market for purposes that have nothing to do with public transport.  If such were to happen, there should be public consultation.  If CIE goes ahead with its plans and pursues the realisation of the maximum commercial value of its sites, it will probably be operating <i>ultra vires</i> and should be challenged legally.  CIE has a clear duty under the Acts to show its projected needs.</P>
        <P>In Galway city, County Galway and Connacht, we want ease of access.  We would all welcome <Col N="401"/>the elimination of bottlenecks in the road network, but if one is to develop north-south access as described previously, one must do so in an integrated way.  It would provide a wonderful opportunity to solve school transport problems.  Not only does one make it possible for families to live in rural County Galway towns by enabling them to purchase sites, but one also makes it possible for them to send children to local schools, which assists significantly in terms of planning.</P>
        <P>In the event of Ceannt Station in Galway city being surplus to public transport requirements, CIE&rsquo;s first duty should be to offer the site to the local authority for the provision of badly needed facilities.  For example, Galway has no school of music or city art gallery &mdash; I could give a long list.  The surplus space could be used for performances in summer and as an ice rink for youngsters in winter, a place of recreation that, unlike many others now being provided, is not steeped in alcohol.</P>

	<P>I have spoken about the specific disaster that will stare us in the face if CIE does not decide to use all of its site for the provision of a long awaited, much needed, proper and regional-structured centre at Ceannt Station.  I also made the case for integrated regional transport authorities and a national transport authority.  While welcoming many of Transport 21&rsquo;s features, we should stress and valorise public transport by changing the ratio of investment in its favour for ecological, economic and social reasons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with mixed feelings that I discuss Transport 21.  I agree with Deputy Michael Higgins regarding integration and the necessary regional approach.  Perhaps it is for this reason that the north west has often failed to have lines on maps recognised, particularly in respect of transport infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, a good, simple and clear reason for this is that most access to County Donegal is through a jurisdiction for which we cannot legislate or plan.  Will those with influence over getting the Northern Executive up and running as soon as possible do so and avail of the significant funding offered by the British Chancellor, Mr. Gordon Brown, and our Government to try to raise Northern Ireland&rsquo;s roads to a certain standard?  Donegal was frowned upon because of its poor road infrastructure, but the tide has turned.  When one reaches the Border, one encounters worse infrastructure in the North.  Infrastructural funding is key to our development.  Unless the north west is seen as a region, with lines on maps that enter and exit it, things will go nowhere.</P>
        <P>Cross-Border co-operation on the Dublin-Belfast motorway galled us, as did the Dublin-Galway, Dublin-Limerick, Dublin-Cork and <Col N="402"/>Dublin-Waterford developments.  We are looking forward to the new national development plan because we want the line on the map and we want the N2-A5 upgraded to motorway status.  Significant improvements have been made to the road and Transport 21&rsquo;s national improvements will also benefit the people of County Donegal.  To go anywhere in Donegal, usually one needs to leave the county.</P>
        <P>It was with great amusement that people learned of our road to Waterford.  Rather than the traditional route of taking the shortest way to Waterford, we will have a road that links us via the western and southern coasts.  When visiting my brother in Cobh, I will be well served by a wonderful road network.  While most people appreciate the benefits, such as tourists in County Kerry travelling as far as Donegal, most people want to be able to reach our capital city and want business people there to be able to access the north west as easily as anywhere else.</P>
        <P>The Dublin-Derry-Letterkenny motorway is important.  At this point, the 2+1 projections discussed with the NRA would improve the situation, but why should we not be provided with a motorway?  Representatives of IBEC and the CBI with whom I spoke at a recent sub-committee meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Belfast supported the emphasis on Donegal.  I pointed out that while most people emphasise the Dublin-Belfast corridor, it was time for business people to speak out on the western corridor&rsquo;s development, the A5 road in our case, as much as politicians do.</P>
        <P>It is also important that the east-west link between Belfast and Letterkenny and beyond be developed, because the road&rsquo;s quality has diminished despite an increased number of people using it.  The time required to get anywhere is substantially longer than it has been even recently.  I hope the Letterkenny-Lifford expansion will be included in the development.</P>
        <P>I do not understand why we cannot have a train system.  I listened to my colleagues from the west extolling the virtues of the western rail corridor and I am disgusted with the fact Donegal, while it used to appear in some of the posters on the western corridor route, was never advocated as a place to which the train would go.  What was wrong with the west, including Donegal?  Donegal is usually included in campaigns relating to the west and we are in the western region for many other purposes.  I cannot see any physical reason why a train cannot set out from Dublin and stop in Derry.  We put substantial investment into the Enterprise service, which is excellent because it takes only two hours to get from Dublin to Belfast, and there is no reason we cannot look for cross-Border funding at European level to make further investment in the Derry-Belfast stretch and have a direct train service from Dublin to Derry.  I do not rule out reopening some of the line into Donegal and ultimately having an all-Ireland service that would loop the country.</P><Col N="403"/>
        <P>We want infrastructure so people can get about and so business people and tourists can access all areas.  If a person buys an Interrail ticket in Europe or uses a student travel pass in Ireland he or she cannot get to Donegal by train.  When I table parliamentary questions Ministers reply to the effect there are buses but we want trains, motorways and the ability to access locations as easily as in other parts of the country.</P>
        <P>In the last national development plan we were not in a position to, if politically sensitive people pardon the expression, infiltrate the North with lines but the context is different now and the opportunity cannot be missed.  As a recent example of this, at the Ard-Fheis the Taoiseach announced there would be a development of the Ulster Canal to link Coleraine, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford.  If that project to join up a line is politically acceptable in the North then the rest of the Six Counties, having suffered from underdevelopment in regional infrastructure, must not be left out of the next national development plan, which I am assured is to be unveiled in the near future.  It cannot be put on the long finger any more.</P>
        <P>We should also recognise the fact we are an island.  Given rising transport costs, so many lorries on the roads and the difficulties caused by an increasing number of cars, alternative methods of moving cargo should be explored.  We should put more investment into the marine sector.  Marine infrastructure should be part of our transport infrastructure and receive as much emphasis as other modes of transport.</P>
        <P>I will introduce a parochial aspect.  In the entire Inishowen Peninsula, in my constituency, there are no national primary routes and only a couple of miles of national secondary routes serving 30,000 people.  The changes in the speed limits to 80 km/h mean we cannot move any faster throughout the peninsula.  Safety is very important but people are trying to get around at the equivalent of 50 mph on roads which are of a generally high standard.  There must be a way of upgrading the Inishowen 100 to national secondary level so we can bring the speed limit up to the equivalent of 60 mph.  I would not ask for that if I was not confident that most of the road surfaces could absorb that speed.  It is an important issue which must be progressed.</P>
        <P>Investment in infrastructure will benefit locals, businesspeople and tourists alike.  Investment in roads will help public transport and investment in the train service, no matter in what region, will indirectly impact everywhere else.  The number of bypasses on the N2 have helped people get to and from Donegal.  In the context of the current discussions on getting the executive up and running in Northern Ireland we must do what was outlined in the north west gateway initiative, namely planning and developing regionally and putting those lines on the map which for political or other reasons were not deemed sensible in the past. <Col N="404"/> That has taken place with the Ulster Canal and motorways and a direct train service into the north west must follow.</P>

	<P>It is a year since I last spoke on this topic in the House.  There has been a series of announcements in the past couple of years but nothing of great benefit to my constituents.  My colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has put forward reasons why Transport 21 is flawed and how we would do it differently.  Deputy Cuffe spoke recently but I want to stick wholeheartedly to my constituency, because it is probably the most gridlocked part of the country.  Bad planning by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats councillors has led to a lot of houses being built with absolutely no facilities.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is happy to live in one of them, though.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>From the N7 to the N4 to the Newcastle Road there is a gridlocked rectangle, a traffic island from one end of the day to the other, from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.  One little accident can cause tailbacks of three or four miles.  While efforts are being made to address these problems they are too little, too late.  Transport 21 contains a number of ambitious proposals that could work as part of an integrated transport plan, such as the recently announced metro west, which follows on from the metro northern route.  It is supposed to link Tallaght, Clondalkin and Liffey Valley shopping centre, covering Lucan and Blanchardstown but will not work unless the main Kildare line is operational.</P>
        <P>With Adamstown coming on stream with 10,000 new houses, all traffic experts say there will not be the capacity to cater for it, let alone for Hazelhatch, the rest of Lucan and Clondalkin, unless the line is electrified.  Under Transport 21 the electrification of the Kildare line is not due to take place until 2015.  The interconnector linking Heuston Station with the city centre is not due until 2015 so what is the point in having a Luas to Lucan or Clondalkin, a metro west plan or what is a negligible bus service if they will not be serviced by the main transport plank, which must be the existing railway line?  When that line is four-tracked and electrified it will have the capacity to take the huge amounts of residential work traffic and act as a hub for travelling north or south, into the city centre or west.  Without that missing link any transport plan is doomed to failure.</P>
        <P>The cost of the works currently being carried out on the M50 has risen to &euro;1 billion from the estimated &euro;300 million and will cause four years of gridlock.  We have an opportunity to fast-track, if Members pardon the pun, the electrification of <Col N="405"/>the railway line and the interconnector.  If the investment is made now then, after four years of gridlock, people will have a choice of how to get from one place to another.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A survey carried out by Maynooth College two years ago found that two thirds of workers in Lucan worked outside the city centre.  Whether they want to go to Citywest, the airport or Blanchardstown, they have no choice but to drive.  Let people spend an hour stuck in traffic if they have a choice, but I call on the Minister for Transport to fast-track electrification and the interconnector so they are given a choice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to highlight a number of priorities in the Border counties and the mid and north-west area of the province of Ulster on a cross-Border basis.  It is very important that in the preparation of the national development plan our transport plans are not made in isolation of the Six County area to the north-east of our country.  The approach must be on an integrated all-Ireland basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The N2-A5 from Dublin to Derry and Donegal, which goes through County Monaghan, is an artery that needs to be substantively addressed by an upgrading to a high standard dual carriageway along significant sections of its length.  This is imperative if we are to see the areas serviced by the N2 reach their natural potential and be able to compete in terms of attracting both indigenous and inward investors.  It is also very important that we recognise there is a willingness to assist on the part of the European Commission, as indicated to me and my colleagues during a recent meeting with EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot in Strasburg.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need to address the need to upgrade the N3, through County Cavan in particular, and the importance of ensuring bypasses of Virginia and Belturbet.  We must upgrade this road to a common standard as it makes its way through County Cavan towards the southern reaches of County Donegal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also wish to highlight the need for an east-west link from Dundalk to Sligo, by whatever bed is decided.  This route would significantly service all of the counties along its length on a North-South basis and not from a Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall viewpoint, further copper-fastening partition.  It is critically important we have this development and that we do not look at development on the island of Ireland focused as if on the spokes of a wheel coming to the hub in Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important also to immediately address the need to develop the Ballinacargy Bridge between Dundalk and Castleblayney, which services a significant volume of traffic and has been the scene of many serious accidents over the years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that the infrastructural developments I have highlighted and the many others I could highlight if I had more time should be <Col N="406"/>seen not just in the context of a new national development plan but as an imperative of both Irish and British Governments in the context of the developing peace process.  There must be a real dividend for the Border counties and the north-west of this island and this can best be expressed in critical infrastructural improvements that will allow the populations of these areas to at last compete on a more level playing field with the eastern seaboard and the southern reaches of the island of Ireland.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>It is not only the issue of roads we need to address.  We also need to look at the urgent requirement of rail transport to service this area.  We should also remember that it is not only the main arteries that need investment.  There is a critical need for significant investment in our local, regional and county roads and these are a priority that must be addressed.  The people need to see a real difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Transport 21.  While I support and welcome all sensible projects and solutions to our transport needs, it is important to also look at the downside and at value for money concerns.  I accept we have moved on and now have some of the best roads in the European Union.  This is welcome.  I particularly welcome the major motorways, cross-Border roads and any plans for the future development of the island as a whole.</P>
        <P>When it comes to major infrastructural projects, there are some downsides.  The hidden story in my constituency concerns the Dublin Port tunnel and how it affects residents in my community.  As well as the tunnel being &euro;250 million over budget, the hidden story is there are now 273 houses in the Marino, Fairview and Santry area that have been damaged as a result of the tunnel&rsquo;s construction despite residents being given a commitment their houses would not be damaged.  Of the houses damaged, 152 were inside the 30 metre zone with 121 outside it.  The homes of 149 families have been repaired so far and in another 113 negotiations are ongoing.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because it is important when planning major projects to ensure professionalism and that local communities are taken care of.  I urge the Minister to ensure the residents of Dublin North-Central whose homes have been damaged are given proper compensation.  The compensation offered so far has been way below a sensible solution.  I urge the Minister to persuade the Government to pay the people whose homes have been damaged and get on with business.  The tunnel is there now and that is the reality.  Of course, the Government must also be concerned with safety issues.</P>
        <P>I strongly welcome the metro to the northside of Dublin.  I welcome in particular the two stops for Griffith Avenue and Drumcondra.  Griffith Avenue is probably one of the nicest avenues in the European Union as Deputy Carey would know having visited many cities.  The metro will <Col N="407"/>be a great service for the people on the northside and I welcome this major project.  I hope the Government will look after local residents and commuters and make sensible decisions with regard to these projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the laudatory comments made by Deputy Finian McGrath on the virtues of Griffith Avenue and surrounding areas.  The importance of Transport 21 is that for the first time here we see a critical shift in transport policy, away from roads towards public transport.  In this regard, I make no secret of the fact that we in the Dublin North-West constituency welcome the initiative taken by the Government as part of its programme for metro north.  We are impressed by the remarkable speed with which decisions have been taken.</P>
        <P>The alignment of the route has been agreed and while further discussions must take place, the principle has been established that we will have a high quality, high speed rail link from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  The line will link with a station under O&rsquo;Connell Bridge and Parnell Square and serve areas like the Mater Hospital, Drumcondra, Griffith Avenue and Dublin City University.  Critically, it will also pass through Ballymun, the greatest rejuvenation project in the European Union, serve Dublin Airport where there will be a station under terminal two which has already begun construction and run on to the Pavilion shopping centre in Swords and beyond.  This project has significant importance for the country and is a good example of how an integrated transport policy can work.</P>
        <P>Deputy Finian McGrath raised some valid issues.  We have learned lessons from building roads.  Equally, we have learned lessons from building the port tunnel.  Undoubtedly, the question of better consultation and engagement with residents is important.  I urge the Minister in his discussions on the furtherance of this project with the RPA to look at how the project can be brought on stream in the fastest possible time by, as far as possible, tunnelling on a 24-hour basis.  We have learned that it is irritating for residents to have a boring machine working beneath them for two or three weeks when a number of days would suffice if the work was done on a 24-hour basis.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the initiative taken by the Government to neutralise the value of land below 10 metres.  This will be helpful.  I agree it is important that the major part of the system will be tunnelled.  My area will discuss concerns with the RPA on Friday.  The idea that any part of the metro system could be erected on stilts or above ground level is, I suggest to the Minister, unacceptable.  Currently, it is proposed that metro north be tunnelled as far as Collins Avenue.  A <Col N="408"/>number of alternatives are then proposed, including that it be at grade level.  I do not believe this is possible because at maximum capacity metro will be operating one train every 90 seconds and the conflict with vehicular traffic would be appalling.  A second alternative that it be run on stilts is unacceptable on the grounds that, either architecturally from an engineering point of view or aesthetically, it would do nothing for Ballymun which is currently being regenerated.  The third alternative is a form of cut and cover similar to that used during construction of part of the Port Tunnel.  It is a little more refined than that but, essentially, that is what is being proposed.  I do not believe it is the best solution and will be pushing strongly that this should not be adopted.</P>
        <P>If the metro can be tunnelled as far as Collins Avenue, it can be tunnelled as far as Santry Cross at a cost of an additional &euro;100 million to &euro;200 million.  To run the metro at grade level or on stilts would involve building a complicated and dangerous interchange in the heart of the new town of Ballymun.  That in itself will cost an enormous amount of money.  The RPA should be instructed not to take that alternative.  The rest of the system has great potential.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement regarding the route alignment for metro north and that public consultation on metro west will begin in a few weeks.  This shows the Government&rsquo;s determination to proceed as quickly as possible to deliver a metro system.  Metro west will run from metro park, just beyond the M50, linking newly developing and existing areas in my constituency of Finglas &mdash; people in this area are highly dependent on public transport as many live too far from the relatively decent bus links &mdash; across to Abbotstown where the National Sports Campus is being built and on to Blanchardstown, one of the largest population centres in the country.  It will then run on to Lucan, Clondalkin, Tallaght and places beyond that as mentioned by Deputy Gogarty.</P>
        <P>It is important we recognise we are speaking for the first time about integration of transport.  This will mean people travelling on the Kildare line will be able to get to Dublin Airport by making one change at Drumcondra.  Similarly, making maximum use of the Liffey junction and other existing infrastructure, it will be possible to provide a high quality rail network in the city.</P>
        <P>I want to speak about road construction.  The M50 upgrade has begun.  We have learned many lessons, most of them positive, from upgrading what used to be known as the Naas dual carriageway.  While there may have been difficulties during certain stages of the management works, the outcome has been truly superb.  We need to heed those lessons while upgrading the remainder of the M50.</P>
        <P>I will now deal with the difficulties that will be posed by the National Roads Authority through the manner in which it is dealing with the upgrading of the M50 and its impact on IKEA, a key <Col N="409"/>feature of the regeneration of Ballymun, a project that stands to deliver up to 500 jobs for that area.  That the NRA persists in its determination to limit to approximately ten per day the number of additional vehicular exits from IKEA onto the M50 is laughable.  The danger of creating gridlock in the local road system is enormous.  I again ask the NRA and, perhaps at this stage, An Bord Plean&aacute;la &mdash; though I do not dare to try to influence its decision on the matter &mdash; to bear in mind that the decision on this matter will have a knock-on effect on others.</P>
        <P>The port tunnel is an enormous engineering project which will be of great value to the city.  There is a possibility &mdash; there is no point pretending otherwise &mdash; that in the initial stages it will have a negative impact on the local road network in my constituency.  We will need to work with Dublin City Council to ensure, for example, that trucks not meant to be on the local road network or clogging up the quays are not doing so.  I suggest to the Minister that it is important we look at an issue which arose during the planning stage but which for a variety of reasons was shelved, namely, the link between the port tunnel on the northside and the N11 along the east coast.  It makes very little sense not to utilise that link.  Given the expertise available today and the availability of public private partnerships and other systems to deliver road and other infrastructural projects, it must be possible to extend the tunnel across to Dublin Bay.</P>
        <P>I welcome the decision by the Minister and Government to allow Dublin Bus to increase its bus capacity by 200.  Dublin Bus is doing a good job.  Despite the criticisms of the company by some, by and large it delivers a quality service to the city as does its sister company, Bus &Eacute;ireann to areas around the country.  However, Dublin Bus has not only been hamstrung by a lack of buses but by a delay in the delivery of bus lanes.  I was a member of Dublin City Council for many years.  I cannot understand why it takes years, not months, for what would appear to be a relatively simple engineering job to be completed.  I recognise that utilities and so on must be diverted but I cannot understand why such projects cannot be completed on time.  Perhaps we could introduce penalty clauses for those contractors who do not deliver on time.</P>
        <P>Integration is important and is part of Transport 21.  It is the first time in the history of this State that we have witnessed a shift from private transport to public transport, an initiative and policy move which I welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to speak on this important issue, Transport 21.  However, I am disappointed the plan contains very little for Sligo and the north west.  While I welcome the recently opened outer relief road which is of great benefit to Sligo, Transport 21 makes no sound provision for this region.  The amount of money available under Transport 21 is &euro;34 billion and it is disap<Col N="410"/>pointing the plan does not include a timeframe within which the Claremorris to Collooney section of the western rail corridor will be opened.  When one considers this 46 mile track in State ownership cost &euro;193 million, it is disappointing it will be only fenced and cleaned up with no further development planned until, possibly, 2020 despite the level of money being spent on the east coast.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been massive growth and development in the region from Charlestown to Tubbercurry, Coolaney and on to Collooney.  The land in this area is in State ownership and the necessary works which could be carried out quickly would have an enormous impact on the region.  It would certainly open up the Claremorris to Galway route.  Much has been said about the road network along the west coast.  There are huge opportunities in this area with potential for enormous value for money.  More than &euro;1 billion was spent on the Luas project and it is now proposed to develop a metro system in Dublin, which I accept is much needed.</P>
        <P>The track from Dublin to Sligo was laid with extraordinary speed.  Apparently, continuous welded track can be laid at the rate of one mile per week because of the technology available and in the absence of compulsory purchase issues.  The land along the corridor is in State ownership and a large proportion of the costings have been completed so all that is needed is the political will to deliver the route.  A line from Galway to Claremorris and Sligo, with a possible extension to the Dublin line, represents a significant opportunity for the west.  I hope, therefore, the Minister will reconsider the matter.  With regard to the return on the investment, the project will offer a unique and unprecedented opportunity for developing housing along the rail corridor.</P>
        <P>I am aware the matter has been politicised and that several Ministers have been looking at the weeds growing along the track.  However, the Minister for Transport is in the driving seat and he has &euro;34 billion to spend.  A survey conducted by the National Competitiveness Council indicates that 58% of respondents do not believe the rail corridor will be delivered, while a further 21% are uncertain about it.  The Minister has been reluctant to reveal costings for projects.  Having been on the Committee of Public Accounts for the past two years, I acknowledge that contracts are being more closely supervised and that the capacity for completing projects on time has been greatly improved.  However, the Minister is making a mistake by refusing to prioritise the western corridor. The &euro;193 million required to build 46 miles of track is reasonable compared to the money spent on national roads, which can cost as much as &euro;15 million per kilometre when services are included.</P>
        <P>A route has been selected for improvements on the N4 at Castlebaldwin.  The N50 is a superb road as far as Mullingar but improvements are needed along the short stretch from Castlebald<Col N="411"/>win to Drumfin.  Drawings and costings have been agreed by the local authority and commencement of work is awaiting the Minister&rsquo;s approval.</P>
        <P>The N17, or the Atlantic corridor, has been much discussed.  The section of that road from Sligo to Knock is one of the most treacherous roads in the country, with heavy traffic and regular fatalities.  The bypass of Knock has been helpful but the stretch from Charlestown to Collooney is narrow and dangerous.  The route for the improvement to this section has been selected and agreed with the local authority.  It is essential that a bypass is built to Tubercurry.</P>
        <P>The N16, which carries cross-Border traffic to and from Enniskillen, and the N15 are extremely dangerous.  As the Taoiseach noted last week, all cross-Border roads have been opened.  However, I am amazed that the timeframe for work on the N16 was not mentioned in Transport 21.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 has largely ignored the N15, the N16 and a considerable portion of the N17.  The Minister should recheck his plans in that regard.  The worst roads of all are the R294 and the R297 from Ballisadare to Enniscrone.  The latter route carries heavy traffic, yet no money has been invested in it.  The Government has failed to deliver for the north west.  The silence of the six Government Members from the region with regard to Transport 21 is appalling.  I would at least have expected Deputy Devins and Senator Scanlon to have intervened vocally on this matter.  I urge them, even at this late stage, to use whatever influence they have to make amends.</P>

	<P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister of the establishment of a Dublin transport authority.  That is great news for Dublin&rsquo;s public transport users because the authority will consolidate the functions of various agencies in providing services and, more importantly, will deliver new licences.</P>
        <P>An additional 100 bus licences will be delivered to private operators, who will also be subject to public service obligations.  For the first time, accurate data will be collected on commercial viability, which will allow us to identify profitable routes and help us to deliver a better transport service.  Despite repeated efforts by the Department, Dublin Bus has been very reluctant to provide figures on the viability and profitability of individual bus routes.  Henceforth, private operators will be required to provide this information to the Dublin transport authority and because they will be competing directly with public operators, the disparity will not be great between their figures and those of Dublin Bus.</P>
        <P>Where there was competition from both Luas and DART services, Irish Rail transformed its practices to such an extent that while Transport 21 proposed the opening in 2009 of a new Dublin city centre rail centre at Spencer Dock, this will now happen next March, two years ahead of schedule.  This is because Irish Rail recognised <Col N="412"/>that it was a competitor for public money and decided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I received correspondence from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Rt. Hon. Peter Hain MP, on 14 September 2006.  I replied to his letter on 2 October 2006 and I am arranging for a copy of the correspondence to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am pleased that he responded so promptly to the communication from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I am sure the Minister would agree that Waterways Ireland has tremendous potential for both sides of the Border.  It is in charge of a very important asset, the administration of our lakes, rivers and canals.  Does the Minister agree that this cross-Border body has been continually dogged by controversy since its institution?  It is rapidly reaching the stage where there may be a danger of a complete breakdown between the northern and the southern elements of the organisation.  Waterways Ireland is becoming a regular topic for discussion not only in this Parliament, but also in other parliaments of these islands.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister further agree that serious allegations made with regard to bullying in the organisation have been upheld?  There has been malpractice in terms of appointments and mismanagement of the organisation, which could do serious damage to North-South relations.  Appointments to senior positions that should have been publicly advertised for open competition proceeded without adherence to the procedure in spite of undertakings given in Stormont in 2002 that senior appointments would be made by open competition involving public advertise<Col N="413"/>ment.  Serious claims have been made of discrimination in these appointments on grounds of religion, politics and nationality, which would be disastrous if found to be true.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister confirm if some of these more recent accusations are the subject of an investigation in Northern Ireland?  I understand that one of the people who alleges discrimination has applied to the Fair Employment Tribunal there.  In spite of the best efforts of Waterways Ireland, this case is being processed and heard at present.  These are very serious accusations, which I have raised here on a number of previous occasions.  While I understand the great potential of the organisation, being continually dogged by such controversies will do no service to us here or our people in Northern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As a North-South implementation body, Waterways Ireland has an excellent record in managing its core business.  When I met my counterpart, Rt. Hon. David Hanson MP earlier this year, we noted with satisfaction the achievement made by Waterways Ireland against the 2005 business plan objectives and its steady progress on the main targets for 2006.  We jointly expressed our support for the ongoing work of developing and promoting the inland waterways network on the island and commended Waterways Ireland for its progressive approach in identifying the issues facing staff in a cross-Border context, bringing together existing and new staff from different backgrounds and cultures and putting in place a positive plan for the future of the organisation.</P>
        <P>On the case to which the Deputy has alluded, the allegations made were very serious and were taken as such by my Department and the co-sponsoring Department in Northern Ireland.  An independent investigation was carried out into the allegations of bullying, harassment and related matters in Waterways Ireland by independent investigators appointed by my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland.  The report of the investigators was submitted to the two Departments.  The bulk of the allegations were not upheld by the investigation.  This is a matter of fact.  The investigation, which was independent of Waterways Ireland and the two Departments, came to the conclusion that the bulk of the allegations could not be upheld.  Having said that, the report recommended a number of actions to be taken by Waterways Ireland.  The Department subsequently monitored progress on agreed actions.  All the agreed actions have now been delivered upon by the CEO to the satisfaction of the two Departments, which are satisfied that this brings the matter to a close.</P>
        <P>Obviously, any person not satisfied with the process to date is entitled to pursue further processes.  I recognise that anybody with a grievance can ultimately go through the courts to vindicate his or her rights.  We have followed a very good <Col N="414"/>process in this case.  This is not the first time this issue has been raised.  We have provided as much information as possible, recognising people&rsquo;s rights to privacy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the information he has given.  Was any disciplinary action taken following the investigation, which upheld allegations of bullying and malpractice in making appointments in Waterways Ireland?  Why are staff in Waterways Ireland here paid more than their counterparts in Northern Ireland for the same sort of work and responsibilities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give a detailed answer on the second issue today.  I will get the Deputy an explanation.  I am sure whatever is done is by agreement.  Obviously, marrying two jurisdictions with different rates of pay and different tax systems poses its challenges.  I understand that all these issues are being addressed.</P>
        <P>I believe I have already supplied the Deputy with a copy of recommended actions to be taken by Waterways Ireland following the report of the investigators.  Those recommendations have been fully implemented.  One of the people with a grievance, who represented part of the subject of the investigation, has taken a case against Waterways Ireland for his dismissal and is seeking reinstatement.  It is that person&rsquo;s right and nobody will deny him it.  Obviously, Waterways Ireland will defend itself and its action in that case, particularly based on the investigator&rsquo;s report.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  the progress made in the discussions between his Department and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission in relation to the translation of Acts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[37101/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Supreme Court in 2001 found that there is a constitutional obligation to publish translations into Irish of Acts of the Oireachtas enacted in English only.  Individual members of the court found that the provision of the translation should be by &ldquo;a fairly rapid procedure&rdquo;, or &ldquo;virtually simultaneously&rdquo;, or &ldquo;as soon as practicable and there is clearly scope for the contention... that it must be available before the Act is sought to be enforced on a person competent and wishing to conduct his official affairs in Irish&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The terms of the judgment in this regard are reflected in section 7 of the Official Languages Act, which came into effect on 14 July last.  There have been ongoing discussions between my Department and the Oireachtas staff and between myself and other members of the Government and the commission on the effect of that provision.</P><Col N="415"/>
        <P>The Government has made it clear to the commission that provision of additional resources, if required, is not an issue.  I have assured the commission on behalf of the Government that the necessary funding for translation work, including staff and other costs, will be provided during the next funding period.  The precise details of the funding required will need to be worked out between the commission and the Department of Finance, as will the precise way in which the agreement should be provided for in the forthcoming legislation to replace the funding provisions of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply on section 7 of the Official Languages Act.  Is the Minister aware of any unacceptable delay in producing the Irish version of any Act since this legislation came into effect?  Is it his view that the commission is the appropriate vehicle for that particular function?  Does it have the resources, the staff and, in particular, access to the highly skilled translators needed for this precise legal work?  Would it not be a better idea if the sponsoring Departments had the responsibility for producing the Irish version of an Act because they produce the English version of the Bill?  Should Departments not have a contemporaneous function in terms of translating a Bill to ensure that when the Bill is eventually enacted there are not any undue delays which can inhibit important processes outside this House that flow from particular items of legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer the last question, when we discussed the Official Languages Act with a view to reducing the burden on the entire system, we agreed here that we would not ask for Bills to be translated.  That does not stop somebody doing preliminary work but it was decided that it would be too much to ask the system to translate every manifestation of a Bill.  That was a right decision.</P>
        <P>The second question concerns who should do that function.  The responsibility for translation of Acts of the Oireachtas rests with the Oireachtas and that has been the case since the foundation of the State.  That is reflected in Standing Order 18 of the Standing Orders of the Oireachtas.  That is why we are in this position.</P>
        <P>There is a challenge for all of us.  Government is not trying to dump this problem on anybody else.  I recognise the challenges.  It does not matter whether I am a member of the Government or a Member of the Oireachtas, we have collective responsibility for fulfilling what are our constitutional obligations.  If anything, it could be argued that the Official Languages Act bought us some time because if the court had asked us we would have said that we had put a process in place that gave us a window of three years.  Otherwise, it could have asked for it much <Col N="416"/>quicker.  That danger existed, although I do not know if it would have materialised.  Nobody knows until one goes before a court, but the Official Languages Act gave us a window in that we could say the State was providing a legislative framework to deal with its constitutional obligations.</P>
        <P>On whether it should be done here rather than in the Department, in terms of efficiency it should be done in one place but the Oireachtas is responsible for legislation, not Departments.  The Oireachtas passes legislation and we have to be satisfied, as Members of the Oireachtas, that there is a standard and an evenness about this process that only the Oireachtas or an agency could provide.  The problem is that legislation is made by the Oireachtas.  There are arguments to the effect that the authentic version of legislative measures should be produced by the Oireachtas for the Oireachtas because its Members are making the legislation.</P>
        <P>The real challenge facing us is not who should do this function because regardless of who does it the same amount of legislation will have to be translated and the same challenges in terms of highly skilled staff and getting the best technology will face us.  There is some fantastic technology that could reduce much of the drudgery in translation.</P>
        <P>The third aspect is money.  The Government has said clearly, and I repeat, that money is not an issue.  The money needed will be provided and we accept that can only come from one source, the Department of Finance.  We will work with the commission on the issue of staff provision.  I have no doubt that if money is needed for the provision of the new technology that is available, which can automatically translate every sentence produced previously, thereby cutting out much of the unnecessary drudgery of legislation, including finance Bills and social welfare Bills and others with fairly similar provisions, it will be provided.  This technology could indicate the ones that are the same and do the translation without the intervention of a human hand.</P>
        <P>There are ways to tackle this problem, which is a joint one.  We are working together and ongoing discussions are taking place to deliver a solution.  It is imperative that we reach the point soon where, very shortly after the passing of Bills by the Oireachtas, there is a version available in the two official languages, as is the constitutional obligation.  It is clearly laid down also in the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister not agree that already the publication of important Bills is being delayed, that he is not even close to putting in place a translation system, that we are heading for somewhat of a mess in that regard and that other ways have to be considered?  I accept all the points the Minister made but it appears the Oireachtas commission is not the appropriate body to have responsibility for this issue.  I am <Col N="417"/>concerned that the delay in publishing important legislation will become worse because it is clear from what the Minister said that he does not know where he stands on this issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear to me the Minister is nowhere on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two requirements for increasing the number of translators and to do that we need money and equipment.  We are dealing with those issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have any specialised translators?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not matter whether they are employed by the Oireachtas Commission or anybody else.  Whoever employs them must be able to control what they do to meet legislative standards and ensure that what is in the Irish translation reflects the measure the House passed.  That is very important.  There must be controls to ensure the Oireachtas is satisfied that the Irish language version is authentic.</P>
        <P>We want to work to the situation that existed for many years when translations were done without machines or computers.  Every Act of the Oireachtas &mdash; I accept there were not as many &mdash; was simultaneously produced in Irish and English.  We must get back to that situation.  With the implementation of the Act we have created some space in which to deal with the arrears.  We must listen carefully to what the Supreme Court said about the responsibility of the whole State, no matter who has it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Effectively, by bringing in the legislation we gave ourselves a three year window.  That three year window is up and we are working positively with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to deal with this issue and I have no doubt we will resolve it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The mid-term review of the national drugs strategy recommended the development of a fifth pillar of the strategy focusing on rehabilitation.  Arising from this, a working group on drugs rehabilitation was set up in September 2005 under the aegis of my Department to develop proposals to augment existing rehabilitation services.  The working group includes representatives from a range of Departments and agencies involved in delivering rehabilitation services, in addition to representatives from the national drugs strategy team, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the community and voluntary sectors.  The terms of reference of the working group are broad and include examining the existing provision of rehabilitation services, identifying best practice, identifying gaps and recommending actions to develop an integrated rehabilitation service.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Some of the group&rsquo;s key recommendations are likely to focus on ensuring that actions 47, 48 and 50 of the strategy are met.  These actions largely relate to providing a continuum of care for clients through planned progression paths for each problem drug user, while ensuring that quality standards are achieved in the services provided.  The group is <Col N="421"/>also likely to deal with wider supports which are needed by recovering problem drug users in areas like involvement in community employment schemes, educational supports and support with progression to employment, housing and child care.  It will also recognise the need to involve the families of problem drug users in the process.</P>
        <P>I expect the working group to complete its report by the end of the year, with a view to beginning the implementation of its recommendations in 2007.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the HSE has established a working group on residential treatment and rehabilitation for substance users.  This group, on which my Department is represented, is examining the residential rehabilitation requirements of people involved in all forms of substance misuse, including the misuse of alcohol.  Its report is likely to be available early in the first half of next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that just one third of my original question has been answered.  I spoke to the Minister about it, but I want to raise it now with the Ceann Comhairle.  I am very annoyed.  The question I originally tabled was &ldquo;to ask the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs the alternatives to methadone treatment that exist for heroin misusers; the structures in place to allow them to become drug free; the progress made in relation to the new rehabilitation tier of the national drugs strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;.  I have received an answer to the third part of that question, but the first two parts of the question were the most important and I want answers to them.  I will write to the Ceann Comhairle about the matter.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is in charge of the drugs strategy, he is responsible for answering questions about alternatives to methadone.  If I am lucky, I will get an answer to the final two parts of my question from the HSE by Christmas, although it is more likely to be Christmas of next year.  I would like a proper discussion about new drugs and other developments in this area, but that is not possible because someone in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs decided that it was a matter for someone other than the Minister of State.  That is what is wrong with this country&rsquo;s approach to the drugs problem &mdash; nobody wants to take responsibility for tackling it.  I told the Minister of State previously that while I accept he has an interest in this area, I do not feel the Government is really committed to solving the problem.  If it was committed to dealing with this matter, I would not have received a letter telling me that my question had to be chopped in three and referred to other Departments.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="422"/>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Two bits were excluded from the question.  I asked about the &ldquo;alternatives to methadone treatment that exist for heroin misusers&rdquo; and &ldquo;the structures in place to allow them to become drug free&rdquo;.  If the Minister of State&rsquo;s section of the Department is not responsible for such matters, we are wasting our time here.  We are supposed to be debating the problem of drugs and the Government&rsquo;s strategy for dealing with it.  They are the two key aspects of the matter.  According to the Government&rsquo;s figures, more than 8,000 people are on methadone and it is costing approximately &euro;30 million.  I cannot get further details of the matter or have a discussion on it.  How can we talk about the drugs strategy, treatment and rehabilitation when responsibility for providing answers is given to another organisation?  I will not get an answer to my question for many months.  The Minister of State knows as well as I do what happens in the Health Service Executive when a question is referred to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I invite the Deputy to ask a supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.  I am very concerned about this matter and my question needs to be answered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not good enough.  The Minister of State said last May, in response to a question, that the working group would publish its review by the middle of the year.  He answered the same question in October by saying it would be published in a couple of months.  He is saying today that it will be published by the end of the year.  When will the review be published?  Can the Minister of State give us a clue?  His reference to actions 47, 48 and 50 of the strategy was the first hint we got of what the working group might be talking about.  Will he give us his opinions on the matter?  Has he met the members of the working group?  He said previously he would not meet them until they had published the full review, but I think he has a duty to meet them before that.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State is the expert in this area, he should be involved in the process.  The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which chose not to answer these questions, should have the expertise in this regard.  What does the Minister of State think should be contained in the new structure?  What does he think we should concentrate on?  He mentioned housing, for which he is responsible, and jobs.  People who are trying to come down off drugs can have problems getting housing, such as rented accommodation, and then getting jobs.  Getting off drugs is like coming out of prison.  We have to find a place in society for such people without any hassle.  They should not have to knock on the doors of public representatives to <Col N="423"/>get help.  If we get people off drugs, it is in our interest to keep them off drugs.  We really have to act on this.  If the working group does not report until January and the Minister of State then spends six months reviewing the report, we will still be talking about this matter this time next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not know that part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question had been excluded.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the Minister of State was not aware, but that is what is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might help the Deputy in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, not the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, cut the question in three.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Methadone is the main substitute form of treatment for heroin users.  The National Advisory Committee on Drugs produced a major report on a form of medication called Subutex, which is a form of buprenorphine, two years ago.  Subutex is used in a number of countries &mdash; it is almost as popular as methadone in some countries.  The report was referred to the Minister for Health and Children at the time.  She has been examining the matter, but the drug has not been made fully available.  The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for approving all forms of medication &mdash; I do not have that responsibility.  Buprenorphine, which is generally made available in tablet form, is deemed to be good for people who are fairly focused and stable.  As it takes 15 or 20 minutes to dissolve buprenorphine under one&rsquo;s tongue, many people in the Health Service Executive feel it offers a fairly large opportunity for diversion.  Therefore, it has not become widely used here.  It can be prescribed by individual doctors, but it is not in mainstream use.  It is legal, but it is not used on a wide scale because of the fears of the authorities in respect of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for answering that part of my original question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 8,000 people are on methadone at present.  It is estimated that there are approximately 14,500 heroin misusers in this country.  Approximately 4,700 of the 8,000 methadone users are being treated in clinics, approximately 2,800 of them are being treated by their general practitioners and approximately 400 of them are being treated under prison-based <Col N="424"/>methadone programmes.  Some 225 general practitioners throughout the country are involved in methadone maintenance, of whom 181 are based in the eastern region and 44 are based outside the eastern region.  Delays often arise when people realise there is a demand in a place like Limerick or Waterford, because the doctors and other medical people in such areas may not be trained in the best forms of care.  They may be trained to level 1, rather than to level 2.  It is not always the case that the service can be opened up because doctors and pharmacies need to be part of it.  More than 370 pharmacies are participating in the programme, more than 200 of which are in Dublin.  It is significant that approximately 150 participating pharmacies are outside Dublin.  I have provided some of the information that Deputy English was looking for.</P>
        <P>I do not deny that the deliberations of the rehabilitation working group, which is chaired by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, have continued for much longer than I thought they would.  That the process has lasted so long is good and bad.  There is no point in a report being signed by me or by somebody in the Department if people in the HSE, in particular, as well as in the voluntary side, have not signed up to the various services.  The working group has encountered many hiccups.  It holds frequent meetings.  I am sure the officials who are dealing with the group would like it to conclude its deliberations.  If the delays result in the production of a good report that everyone can sign up to, they might be worthwhile.  A great deal is happening in respect of rehabilitation.  Putting 8,000 people on methadone was a short-term measure that was supposed to last a couple of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>It is now a long-term approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  A great deal of good work is being done in the area of rehabilitation, but some unfocused work is also being undertaken.  The working group will try to suggest some structures to pull it all together and develop best practice.  Some of the rehabilitation work is not great, although most of it is great.  It may be the case that more people on community employment schemes, for example, should be involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer.  I am glad that we have been able to discuss the alternative to methadone.  That was all I wanted.  I understand why we are stuck with methadone, but we should try to move away from it at some stage.  The Minister of State said that the working group&rsquo;s deliberations have taken much longer than was planned.  The same thing happened with the regional drug task forces &mdash; they took a year or two longer than planned to conclude their reports.  Can the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources <Col N="425"/>set deadlines for the production of reviews and reports?  Can the Minister of State give me a guarantee we will discuss this report before Christmas?</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs how</askee>
        <Quest> the recent Government approval of the allocation of almost &euro;1 million from the dormant accounts to fund 20 projects providing suicide prevention supports will be spent; the number of groups that applied for such funding; the number that have received funding; how they are assessed for eligibility; if further funding will be allocated to this area; and which will be the lead Department in the distribution of these funds. </Quest>
        <QRef>[37289/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Funding to assist suicide prevention initiatives is one of the priority measures approved by the Government for support from the dormant accounts fund in 2006.  Details concerning the allocation of almost &euro;1 million from the dormant accounts fund to support 20 suicide prevention projects were announced on 23 October 2006.</P>
        <P>The key objective of this funding measure is to provide interventions and supports to strengthen community-based initiatives, particularly those <Col N="426"/>targeting young men under 35 years of age.  The intention of the funding is to support locally-based initiatives that deal with suicide prevention.  The projects approved are varied and include the provision of early intervention measures for those at risk and also the provision of services for those bereaved through suicide.  Details of the projects, including the grants approved and the specific actions proposed, have been provided as an appendix to this reply.</P>
        <P>The lead Department for this funding measure is the Department of Health and Children.  We engaged an agency to administer the application and assessment process.  In total, 125 applications were received in response to a public invitation.  In accordance with section 44(1) of the Dormant Accounts Acts 2001 to 2005, all applications were evaluated against criteria which were published.  An inter-departmental committee considered the recommendations and approved them.</P>
        <P>While the dormant accounts fund comes within my Department&rsquo;s remit, the lead Department in the distribution of these funds is the Department of Health and Children.  Accordingly, the funding for the approved projects will be channelled through that Department&rsquo;s Vote.  The question of further funding from dormant accounts to support suicide prevention initiatives will be a matter to be considered by the Government in the Minister&rsquo;s annual submission of proposals under section 43 of the Dormant Accounts Acts.  Mainstream funding to support suicide prevention initiatives is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</P><Col N="425"/>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  This question is in response to the debate we had in late October.  In that debate, the Minister of State said that 11,000 young people cause themselves deliberate self-harm every year and that Ireland has the fifth highest suicide rate in the EU for 15 to 24 year olds.  The rate is even higher for men in their 20s and 30s, with men under 35 accounting for approximately 40% of suicides.  I welcome the fact that the funding was given to groups, but there were 125 applications for funding.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State accept that more funding is needed in this area?  How important is this issue?  We had cross-party support on it.  Does he accept that we are doing enough and that the figures I read out are frightening?  He stated that funding was a matter for the Government, but is the role of community involvement not as important?</P><Col N="428"/>
        <P>There is a voluntary group in my own area called Teenline, which covers all of Ireland.  It was set up in July and it received 1,000 phone calls between then and October, covering everything from suicidal feelings to attempted suicide, relationship bereavement, loneliness, violent assault, sexual assault and so on.  The difficulty is that this is just one group and it has received no funding.  The group operates on Friday and Saturday for a couple of hours.  I have spoken to its volunteers and they told me that they receive no funding whatsoever.  The group did not apply for funding as it was established in 2003 but only registered in 2005 and it did not wish to operate out of somebody&rsquo;s house.  It is one of those groups that has fallen through the gaps.  The group has no register, so if somebody rings in from Kerry, the group cannot refer the person to any service in that county.</P>
        <P>This group is a first for Ireland and there is no training provided, so it must buy in services from abroad.  I am aware that the lead Department is <Col N="429"/>the Department of Health and Children, but this is a community initiative so I want the Minister of State with responsibility for community affairs to take this on board.  Suicide is a growing problem and the community response can help.  Can the Minister of State look at the possibility of helping these groups in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A cross-departmental committee was set up this year on the dormant accounts fund and this was one of the projects mentioned.  We have &euro;60 million to spend this year, of which &euro;24 million was spent on social and economic disadvantage.  The next programme will probably cost &euro;30 million and if the Deputy recommends it and we get good feedback, we will consider the project next year.  We were delivering two years&rsquo; worth of funding this time.</P>
        <P>I accept that only 20 applications received money out of 125 applications.  We did not decide the assessment criteria as we hired an outside agency, Pobal, which made recommendations based on its criteria.  We did not change the recommendations as they came in, but they liaised with the National Office of Suicide Prevention.  I accept that many of the groups that received money seemed to be fairly professional and that Pobal went for those applications rather than smaller community applications.</P>
        <P>The National Office of Suicide Prevention was set up in the last year and it received &euro;1.2 million in funding for its own work.  The Department of Health and Children spends about &euro;800 million on mental health per annum.  This funding was put forward as a suggestion to help community groups and I am sure it will be considered again next year.  The overall funding may be smaller, but that depends on the response and the reaction to what we have done.</P>

        <QRef>[37001/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Supply reduction is one of the cornerstones of the national drugs strategy and the operations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are central in this regard.  In 2005, a total of 1,166 people were prosecuted for drug offences in County Cork.  This represented a significant increase on the 867 prosecuted in 2004.  I welcome the recent break up of a cocaine distribution operation in Cork and I congratulate the Garda on its efforts. <Col N="430"/> Each such success, especially one of the scale involved in Cork, is significant in the overall effort against the misuse of drugs.  However, the operation illustrates the level of the danger posed by cocaine and given the global nature of the drugs problem, the Garda is very aware that there is always a risk of others trying to fill any gap in the market.</P>
        <P>While I am confident that the problem of cocaine use is being addressed through the implementation of the actions in the national drugs strategy, I also recognised the need for an overview of the emerging threat from cocaine.   In September, I received a joint briefing paper from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the national drugs strategy team.  I am currently awaiting responses from the relevant agencies and Departments on how the recommendations of the briefing paper might be addressed.  It is envisaged the matter will be followed up further at the December meeting of the interdepartmental group on drugs.</P>
        <P>The main focus of the national drugs strategy in respect of the education sector is on preventative strategies targeting the primary and secondary levels, as well as the informal education sector, including youth services.  Arising therefrom, all schools now have substance misuse prevention programmes included in their curricula.  In addition, the national drugs awareness campaign focused specifically on cocaine use in one of its initiatives.  That campaign, targeted at the 18 to 35 year old age group, sought to dispel the image among some that cocaine is a clean and safe drug with few detrimental consequences.</P>
        <P>Other measures taken include: support for six cocaine-specific projects under the emerging needs fund, one of which is located in Cork and was allocated &euro;110,000 to focus on the provision of direct community-based services for cocaine-users; and the launch last year of four pilot cocaine treatment projects with funding of almost &euro;400,000 to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use, as well as a training initiative focusing on front-line workers.</P>
        <P>The problems associated with cocaine use are not being underestimated and I believe that progress is being made in that regard.  I will continue to respond in a flexible and focused way as the situation evolves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and echo his congratulations to the garda&iacute; on the successful seizure in Cork.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, the seizure was worth approximately &euro;500,000.  A mixing agent was seized at the same time, and if it had been mixed with the cocaine, the drug would have been worth double, some &euro;1 million.  As the Minister knows, there are internationally accepted estimates that between 5% and 10% of illegal drugs are seized by the authorities.  That gives one an idea of the <Col N="431"/>quantity of cocaine that is being imported here and the kind of money involved.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus once more on the recreational use of cocaine.  The Minister of State referred to people viewing cocaine as a clean drug, but there is growing concern among medical experts that it is becoming a major health risk.  The number of cocaine overdoses in 2005 was double the figure for the entire 1990s.  From 1991 to the end of the decade, 100 cocaine-related deaths occurred, and 27 fatal overdoses have occurred since 2000 in which cocaine was a factor.  The health aspect is that the heart can be damaged by cocaine.  It can cause death, and where taken in conjunction with alcohol, it can do internal damage to the person.  Whereas the measures outlined by the Minister are very welcome, I firmly believe that there must be a much more focused and effective approach to education for that growing band who see nothing wrong with using cocaine, since they perceive it as a clean drug.  There is also the issue of their turning a blind eye to the fact that some very nasty, ruthless criminals are ultimately the greatest beneficiaries.</P>
        <P>What urgency will the Minister of State bring to coming to terms with and preventing cocaine use and reducing dramatically the number of people who see taking it as a fairly harmless pursuit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with everything the Deputy said.  There is no doubt that, while the garda&iacute; and the customs and excise service have been very successful, large quantities of drugs are still getting through, and the price on the street is probably the most accurate measure of that.  Any drugs seizure can seriously disrupt a given operation, put people out of business or foster disputes between them.  However, others always seem willing to move into the breach.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that the image of cocaine as clean and harmless is absolutely false.  I do not wish to defend heroin, but cocaine is a far more dangerous substance.  Many of the problems of heroin relate to how it is taken, the dirty needles, drug-taking paraphernalia and infections, with people running down their health.  However, regarding the substances themselves, cocaine is far more serious in the long term to someone&rsquo;s well-being and health.</P>
        <P>That is not the image, and many people see themselves as recreational users who would look down their noses at heroin users.  One of our problems is trying to attract such people into services since those that we have so far use the same premises.  We find that some of those middle-class people do not want to go near a drug treatment service on the basis that they are not really druggies.  However, the damage that they are causing themselves is extremely serious.  We have tried awareness campaigns, the last of which advertised on television, beer mats and posters.  I <Col N="432"/>am sure that Deputy O&rsquo;Shea will remember the &ldquo;Jack and Jill&rdquo; series.  It was targeted at pubs and night clubs used by 18 to 35 year olds.  We have tried to reach them in their own language to make plain the damage that they are causing to themselves.</P>
        <P>The problem is that they do not see the difficulty.  They are still quite slow in coming forward for treatment.  There is no substitution treatment like methadone for heroin.  There are services, but many involve counselling, alternative therapies, acupuncture and so on.  The national drugs strategy team and the national advisory committee on drugs are working together to produce proposals and we will see what they do.  However, we must get those people into services targeted at them.  It has been slow for the penny to drop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister on the dangers of cocaine.  Is there any possibility of extending the support and range of services when it comes to educating parents and young people of the dangers of that and other drugs?  There are parent-to-parent courses in north County Dublin of which the Minister of State will be aware, a good example of a positive response.  One of the pharmaceutical companies produced a DVD called &ldquo;Empower: The Family Guide to Understanding Drugs in Ireland&rdquo;.  It is very hard-hitting, dealing not only with the effects on health.  For example, if there is a conviction for possession or any law-breaking, people cannot travel or get a job.  It effectively wrecks lives as well as health.  Can the Minister of State facilitate the wider distribution of such a DVD, which is very immediate and wide in its impact?</P>
        <P>On 12 June, &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; broadcast a programme called &ldquo;The Irish Connection&rdquo;.  It was clear that much of the cocaine was coming in through Spain.  Does such a programme result in a sharper focus, or are we getting information that is already in the hands of those who need to take action?  It struck me that many of the drug-dealers from Ireland were becoming deeply involved in Spain.  That seems to have resulted in a major supply of cocaine into this country.  Is there any progress to report on that score?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The best way of combating cocaine for publicans and everyone else is WD40.  One need only spray it on cisterns and users are no longer able to snort it.  Regarding evaluation of projects, I asked the Minister of State this before.  At this stage I risk repeating myself <i>ad infinitum</i>.  When will it take place?  Will it be after Christmas as with rehabilitation?  How many of the four original projects relating to cocaine abuse remain in operation?  Will interim funding be available, in the period until the evaluation is produced, for those that remain up and running?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Cocaine mainly originates in Colombia in South America and has traditionally been transported into Europe through Spain and <Col N="433"/>Portugal.  Spain is the main transit route and many Irish drug dealers live permanently in Spain in places such as Alicante.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has international contacts and works with Interpol and other police forces.</P>
        <P>I do not know if it is the one to which Deputy Sargent referred, but I recall launching a DVD made by a group in Tipperary.  I am not sure whether it related to cocaine abuse.  We use any means necessary to get the message across but the difficulty is that, regardless of whether it is suicide, car accidents or cocaine, young people or those in their 20s and 30s always believe that bad things will never happen to them.  They believe that they can handle cocaine, that they are merely recreational users, and that they can walk away from it whenever they like.  That attitude is simplistic and wrong.  Many of these individuals do walk away.  I would not try to pretend that people take one sniff of cocaine and are hooked for life because that is not true.  However, a certain number of people are sucked in and develop ongoing habits and severe health problems thereafter.  Those who abuse both cocaine and alcohol become extremely aggressive.</P>
        <P>On the four projects to which Deputy Crowe referred, the Tallaght project is ongoing and funding has been continued.  I understand that one of the projects fell by the wayside.  There must be a certain momentum and throughput of work before such projects can be properly evaluated.  The funding will continue at least until such time as the evaluation is produced.  Some of these projects can be extremely successful as short-term measures but it is our responsibility to discover whether they will work in the longer term.  It is not really a case of evaluating them on the basis of the number of people that access them in the first two or three weeks.  These projects must be evaluated on an ongoing basis.  As stated earlier, some of those who see themselves as recreational users are reluctant to use drug treatment facilities that might be used by others during the day.  They might realise that they have a problem but they probably want to access treatment facilities at different times than others or else attend at separate locations.</P>
        <P>Matters are not as simple as they might often seem.  The projects to which the Deputy refers have potential and funding will continue until the professional evaluation is produced.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if he is confident that a reduction of 5% in prevalence of opiate use will be achieved by 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36908/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Two key studies are to be undertaken in the next year or so through which progress of the prevention pillar of the national drug strategy will be monitored.  These will be compar<Col N="434"/>able to studies that were carried out in 2000 and 2002.</P>
        <P>With specific respect to opiate users, and to the 5% target figure for 2007, the first benchmark study carried out was the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, study, A 3-Source Capture Recapture Study of the Prevalence of Opiate Use in Ireland 2000 to 2001, published in May 2003.  The study estimated that 14,452 people were using heroin in 2001, of which 12,456 were in the greater Dublin area.  This represented a small decrease on the 1996 figure for the greater Dublin area, which indicated that 13,461 people were using heroin.  Work on a further such study is now at planning stage but it will be at least 12 months before the figures emerge.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, the outcome of the recently commenced drugs prevalence survey 2006-07, with a first report of national prevalence figures and trends expected in late 2007, will provide up-to-date information on the national prevalence of a range of drugs including heroin.  It will also, for the first time, provide comprehensive information on trends since the initial survey in 2002.</P>
        <P>As to whether the 5% target alluded to by the Deputy and relating to the capture-recapture study will be reached, this will only be known when the new study is completed around the end of next year.  However, there are encouraging signs of progress over the past couple of years in tackling heroin use, and drug use in general &mdash; be it in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion and success of treatment services, the development of prevention programmes in schools, the expanding work of local drugs task forces, the establishment of regional drugs task forces, the work of the young peoples facility and services fund and the results of the research outcome study in Ireland, ROSIE, which recently reported very positively on the successful outcomes from the treatment of opiate users.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know much more than I did before the question was answered.  I accept, however, that the Minister cannot predict what will be the figure and that we will be obliged to wait until the end of next year.</P>
        <P>If the 5% target is to be perceived as being real, every effort must be made to reach it.  Does the Minister of State intend to increase funding in the next two months and in the first half of 2007 to help us achieve the target?  Can he provide a commitment that if the report, when it is published at the end of next year, shows that we only reached 3.5% or 4%, he will provide additional resources to ensure that the 5% target is reached?  There is no point setting targets if we do not make an effort to reach them.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State commented earlier that young people, whether in connection with drugs, suicide or car accidents, believe that nothing bad can happen to them.  I agree with him in that regard.  A cross-departmental effort must be <Col N="435"/>made in respect of these matters and there should be an advertising campaign to emphasise that bad things can happen to young people.  Only one in 8 million people win the national lottery, but we are told that it can happen to all of us.  Everyone believes that they can win the lottery.  If they did not, they would not buy tickets.  However, when it comes to dabbling in drugs, driving like lunatics or taking their own lives, people do not believe that anything bad can happen to them.  As the Minister stated, this is a matter we can tackle and it might help us reach the 5% target.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The money being spent through the Department increased dramatically in recent years.  The figure for this year is &euro;43 million, which represents an increase of 60% on the figure for two years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not doubt that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is only part of what is spent.  All of our initiatives through the local or regional drugs task forces are pilot schemes, which are then evaluated and mainstreamed.  Approximately &euro;25 million worth of funding has moved out into the mainstream.  In the region of &euro;70 million is being spent each year on projects that began at community level.  When one adds this to the &euro;80 million or &euro;90 million invested by the HSE, it is clear that the Government is spending approximately &euro;200 million on trying to tackle the drugs problem.  I am sure that this funding will continue and that it will be increased because the problem is not going to go away.</P>
        <P>If I begin to lay down too many targets, the Deputy will return to the House next month, criticise me for not achieving them and accuse me of failing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but a target was set.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We are doing our best and are trying to get the message across.  We are providing resources in respect of the initiatives that have come forward.  The ROSIE study was great because it proved that treatment works.  We are trying to provide people with services.  The drug problem is international in nature and it would be foolish for us to believe that illegal drugs will not be brought into this country.  We must try to work with people and try to help those who sadly become addicted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that money is being invested.  However, a target has been set.  It is not often that such targets are set and it is great to see this being done.  However, the Minister of State has more or less stated we should not worry about the target.  Should I forget about the target and stop asking questions about it or does it mean something?  I do not want to know how much is being spent.  I wish to discover whether I should <Col N="436"/>cross the target off my list of matters about which to table questions to the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There are targets, but we need proper baseline data to follow up.  We have the 2006 figure for heroin users, which showed a slight drop on the 2001 figure but showed that there were 2,000 plus outside Dublin.  Six or seven years ago those people outside Dublin were probably included in the Dublin figure because one hears of stories of people who came from Arklow or Athlone every day by train.</P>
        <P>When we get the figures next year I hope to see the figure in Dublin continuing to drop a little, but next year it may well be that the figures outside Dublin will have increased solely because the services now exist elsewhere.  One hears dramatic headlines that the numbers in treatment in Athlone or Portlaoise have increased by 400%.  That is a good development because it means that services are being provided, where previously they probably were not provided.  A few of them might have been travelling to services in Dublin, but most of them were probably robbing or mugging or selling drugs to get money to buy their next fix.  When we get this data next year we will have something with which to compare it.  It will be the third set of figures for Dublin and the second set of figures for outside Dublin, and it will give us baseline data on how we are proceeding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Minister of State speak of the targeting of finance.  Will he indicate how the finance is being targeted?  Is he aware that the problem, according to the analysis on the DVD, which he has obviously seen also, began for the cases to which it referred in primary school due to bullying.  It was the resolve of the children who had been bullied not to be bullied in secondary school and, therefore, they were determined to fit in with their peer groups, act tough and dabble in drugs, as they saw it, as a way to gain acceptance in their peer group.  Will the Minister of State liaise with the Department of Education and Science to ensure that we get to the heart of that reason to start on drugs?</P>
        <P>The other side of it is the treatment.  There has been some movement on treatment, but will the Minister of State accept that there is a long way to go before there will be adequate treatment available for those who are interested and in a position to gain treatment?  Often those coming out of prison, for example, find that in prison they can get treatment but when they leave prison they are left without it.  The incidence of relapse and return to drugs is an appalling indictment and, ultimately, indicates that the treatment itself was a failure.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether there will be follow through on treatment resulting in the necessary genuine success rates for people who enter treatment and that they will be monitored and have their hands held <Col N="437"/>until they are absolutely clean, able to get a job and return to normal life?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There are prevention, education and awareness campaigns.  Prevention is one of the five pillars of the strategy.  In large part it is focused on the cannabis level, through schools.  Under the SPHE programme, all schools include addiction and drug prevention modules as part of general overall education so that students have knowledge of it.  At first this was provided in all schools in local drugs task force areas but it is now supposed to be in all schools nationally.</P>
        <P>On the heroin side, there are 8,000 of 14,500 people in treatment.  That, seemingly, is good by international standards but we would like there to be more in treatment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to the figures I gave earlier, there are approximately 400 people in prison on methadone.  There was a bigger problem when the open door system in prisons was more evident and people were let out on unplanned temporary release.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Methadone is not treatment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This is what we are trying to do.  Persons, whether inside or outside prison, are provided with the services and if somebody is released in a planned way, that service is provided.  In the past the hiccups arose where somebody was released suddenly from prison due to overcrowding or the like, and the outside service was not in place.  The position in that regard is better now and the Irish Prison Service is part of the IDG, from which we received a number of presentations.  We are trying to provide the same services for drug misusers, both inside and outside prison.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter I am raising is the need for the Minister to clarify whether her Department or any agency of the State is involved, financially or otherwise, in a legal action threatened by the Mater Misericordiae Hospital against the founder of Patients Together, Ms Janette Byrne.  The Minister will be glad to know that Ms Byrne is in the Public Gallery today.</P>
        <P>It is scandalous that the Mater Misericordiae Hospital should threaten the founder of Patients Together with legal action.  Ms Byrne is a courageous woman who has battled against cancer, as has her mother.  Arising from her experience in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, she founded Patients Together to campaign against the appalling conditions pertaining in the accident and emergency unit in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital.</P>
        <P>Recently she published a book entitled <i>If It Were Just Cancer: A Battle for Dignity and Life</i> in which she recounts her battle with cancer, her experiences in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and the shortcomings in hygiene in St. Vincent&rsquo;s ward where she received chemotherapy.  In the book and on many other occasions that I witnessed, she generously praised the nursing and medical staff for the quality of their work and their service in ensuring patients were dealt with efficiently and professionally.  She stated there was a quality service at all times.</P>
        <P>However, the Mater hospital directed the eminent firm, William Fry, solicitors, to send an Exocet in her direction.  The solicitors threatened her publishers, Veritas, and demanded:</P>
        <P LI="1">...you inform Ms Byrne of our client&rsquo;s concerns and request that she does not report these allegations again.  In addition, our clients require that you reprint the book extinguishing all the factual misstatement contained therein.  We must also insist that you immediately remove from your website language designed to promote your publication, which is defamatory.</P><Col N="440"/>
        <P FLI="0">Thankfully, Janette Byrne is made of sterner stuff and she directed her solicitor to respond with a robust defence.  She countered that the hospital is trying to bully her into silence.</P>
        <P>The response to this issue on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; yesterday and on Tuesday was a ringing endorsement of Janette&rsquo;s description of her experience in her book by members of the public who experienced the same conditions in the accident and emergency department and St. Vincent&rsquo;s ward in the Mater hospital.  As recently as last Saturday I inspected the accident and emergency department in the hospital, as I do most Saturdays during my weekly vigil.  I stood outside the department every Saturday between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. for more than three years.  Despite the statements on the hospital&rsquo;s website, the overcrowding was as bad as ever with chairs and trolleys taking up the entire department.  I have received numerous complaints from patients and relatives about hygiene in the department&rsquo;s toilets.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough that a wholly publicly funded hospital, which is one of the largest in the State, should respond to somebody like Janette Byrne who has taken up the cudgels against it on behalf of vulnerable and sick patients who are left lying on trolleys and sitting on chairs for days by taking legal action.  Equally appalling conditions pertain in the accident and emergency departments of other hospitals.</P>
        <P>Is the Department or another State agency involved in the legal action?  Has the Minister of State contributed or supported, financially or otherwise, this threatened action by the Mater hospital against Veritas and Janette Byrne?  If so, it is scandalous that Exchequer funds should be used in this fashion.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that State funding to the hospital will not be used under any circumstances to process the legal action, if it proceeds?  Janette Byrne has done a fantastic service to the State.  It is a matter of concern to many vulnerable and ill people that these issues are highlighted.  If the State colludes in silencing somebody like her, we will have a serious problem on our hands.  I call on the Minister of State to clarify the position on the legal action and whether he has hand, act or part in it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which I am taking on the adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the recent publicity surrounding the issuing of a letter by solicitors on behalf of the Mater hospital in the context of a book written by one of its former patients.  The Department is advised by the HSE that the hospital is not pursuing a legal action against the patient in question.  The hospital accepts the right of a patient to highlight what they perceive to be inadequacies in the service and acknowledges the entitlement of the <Col N="441"/>patient to express opinions regarding the treatment received as a patient in the hospital.  The HSE has advised that the hospital&rsquo;s solicitors have written to the publishers pointing out what the hospital sees as a number of factual inaccuracies and misstatements contained in the book and asking that those inaccuracies and misstatements be corrected in the next edition.</P>
        <P>This course of action is being pursued by the Mater hospital in its own right as a voluntary hospital.  Neither the Department nor the Health Service Executive is party to communications between the hospital and the publishers. The Department is further advised that any costs arising from the course of action being taken by the hospital will be paid out of its own resources, not out of any moneys provided by the Exchequer.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important matter as a terrible conflict is ongoing in Bellanaboy, County Mayo, involving hundreds of garda&iacute; and protestors, and I fear for people&rsquo;s safety as lorries leave the site at speed.  A means to resolve this dispute was proposed by the Shell to Sea group in a statement last Monday, 6 November.  The group proposes the establishment of an independent, public commission of inquiry, which should comprise one or more members who are acceptable to all sides in the dispute; that the central purpose of the commission should be an investigation into the optimum development concept for the Corrib gas project; that the optimum development concept be determined according to a comprehensive set of criteria which shall include environment, health and safety, local and regional benefits and community consent; that community consent be the critical criterion employed in determining the optimum development concept; that the work of the commission be done in public through open hearings involving submissions, cross-questioning and other investigations deemed appropriate; and that the commission makes recommendations regarding the optimum development concept.</P>
        <P>This proposal offers a reasonable and sensible way through which the Corrib gas conflict can be resolved.  All sides in this dispute claim community support and, therefore, none should fear community consent as the key criterion.  Previous efforts to resolve the dispute have been characterised by their narrow focuses and limited terms of reference.  This proposal outlines an open, transparent and democratic method for determining how the Corrib gas project can be developed.  This proposed project is wrong and has its genesis in the decision of the Minister for the marine in October 2000 to locate a gas processing terminal <Col N="442"/>for the Corrib gas field in Bellanaboy on a site surrounded by blanket bog within the catchment of the primary water supply for the entire Erris region and located directly across from an established community.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The production pipeline will carry unprocessed gas and run 9.5 kilometres inland parallel to another established community.  There is a great deal wrong with this.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources agreed to sell the land involved to Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited, Shell&rsquo;s predecessor, without first considering advice about the suitability of the site.  He issued consents in breach of EU Directive 98/30/EC because he failed to include a requirement that the pipeline comply with the code of practice.  He confined the terms of reference of the Advantica safety review and the mediation process to the pipeline, even though the key issue was the siting of the terminal in Bellanaboy.  It is wrong of the Minister to state the project was independently assessed and Advantica said the site was acceptable.  The limitations of the Advantica report have often been outlined.  Its focus on the effects of the pipeline rather than the cause, the Bellanaboy site, was too narrow.</P>
        <P>In respect of itself, the Advantica report states: &ldquo;It does not include detailed examination of the feasibility of alternative project design options, alternative pipeline designs or routes.&rdquo;  Mr. Kevin Moore, a planner with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, stated that the terminal was located in the wrong place.  He also stated that the developer ignored the board&rsquo;s request to provide information on alternatives and that the Minister&rsquo;s consent for the pipeline &ldquo;could reasonably be determined as being premature&rdquo; and had &ldquo;emphasised a perception to some degree that the granting of planning permission for the ... processing terminal at the Bellanaboy site is a <i>fait accompli</i>&rdquo;.  As the connecting downstream pipeline from Bellanaboy to Galway was already decided and announced, this conclusion is unavoidable.</P>
        <P>It is obvious that the situation is wrong and the planning process was flawed.  Cold venting, a process that threatens the environment, was not included in the planning process.  There are significant questions about this matter.  A petrochemical industry, a 400-acre footprint, will be located in a pristine area.  Without going into detail on the effects on the area, such as 50 full-time jobs, the location is wrong.  Such a matter has never been examined in this way.</P>
        <P>Fundamental to the issue is that the pipeline and not its location was examined.  The situation was flawed from the beginning and premeditated to ensure that Shell got exactly what it wanted.  Not even An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the Minister could get Shell to examine alternatives.  Mr. Peter Cassells&rsquo;s hands were tied behind his back because he was not allowed to examine more than the pipeline.  For the sake of the people in <Col N="443"/>the area, the Minister must consider a commission of inquiry, as it is the only way forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  Last Monday, I was delighted to walk more than a mile with the Shell to Sea campaign and to show solidarity on behalf of the Labour Party with the people of Erris and north County Mayo.  I was struck by the wide spectrum of Mayo opinion represented in the protest.  Farmers, fishermen, teachers, women on household duties and senior citizens took the time to visit and support the protest from 6.30 a.m. or 7 a.m. before their day&rsquo;s tasks began.</P>
        <P>I was also struck by the reasonable attitude of many people I met there and in Castlebar at the press conference organised by Shell to Sea.  When I addressed the protest with Labour Party president Deputy Michael Higgins, Deputy Joe Costello, Counsellor Harry Barrett of the Mayo Labour Party and Mr. Hughie Baxter of Roscommon-South Leitrim, I noted the achievement of the public campaign by the people of Erris and north-west Mayo since 2000.</P>
        <P>The Advantica technical advisory group and the Centre for Public Inquiry reports vindicated their stance on the safety of the pipeline and the Peter Cassells mediation clearly decided that the pipeline pressure and route needed to be changed.  I commend our great colleague in the labour movement, Mr. Cassells, for his profound efforts.</P>
        <P>It is tragic that five brave Rossport citizens spent 94 days in jail to vindicate their rights and that the progress made since autumn 2005 could not have brought the problem to a resolution.  Mr. Andy Pyle, the chief executive of Shell, apologised for the imprisonment of the Rossport Five and immediately after their release seemed to indicate that direct face-to-face talks without preconditions would commence while work on the Bellanaboy facility was suspended.  Sadly, those negotiations have not taken place and Mr. Terry Nolan, the deputy CEO, and his colleague, Mr. John Egan, continue to indicate that the refinery&rsquo;s location cannot be discussed.</P>
        <P>The overwhelming wish of the people I met last Monday was for talks without preconditions to take place urgently.  Last Monday in Castlebar, Dr. Mark Garavan and his Shell to Sea committee announced an important initiative, namely, the establishment of an independent public commission of inquiry to<b><i> </i></b>investigate the Corrib gas project.  The main purpose of the commission is to develop an optimum development concept for the Corrib gas field.  The concept will be determined according to a set of criteria, including health and safety, local and regional benefits, environment and community consent.  The last criterion is regarded as key and would come into operation following open public hearings and a commission recommendation.</P><Col N="444"/>
        <P>As I said in the aptly named Michael Davitt room of the Imperial Hotel in Castlebar, this proposal is important and worthy of deep consideration.  In a conversation with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, yesterday and a letter to him and Mr. Pyle of Shell &mdash; I will also write to Marathon and Statoil &mdash; I urged that the proposal be examined and used as the basis for intense face-to-face negotiations between the parties concerned under respected, independent mediation.  I renew my call for such talks and express the hope that such a development might lead to a full resolution of the dispute and allow this vital gas field to be harvested as Ireland&rsquo;s critical transitional fuel while moving to a renewable era.  Such talks, if accompanied by a suspension of the works at Bellanaboy, would lead to the immediate end of the protest, as Dr. Garavan declared yesterday.</P>
        <P>It has been indicated to me that feelings have run so strongly that it might be wise to turn to some of the partners with experience in the field, such as Norway, to lead the discussion.  I propose the involvement of, for example, a former Norwegian energy Minister.  The ball is in the court of the Taoiseach, the Minister, Shell&rsquo;s chief executive, Mr. Pyle, and the Statoil and Marathon companies.  Time is of the essence and, even with agreement tomorrow, Corrib gas would not flow ashore until later in 2009.  Government intervention is critical and I urge the Minister and Mr. Pyle to review their positions, examine the proposal of Dr. Garavan and his committee carefully and give a considered response to the Shell to Sea initiative.</P>
        <P>Every Deputy and everyone who knows Mayo, Galway and Connacht in general welcomed the decision to bring gas to Connacht towns.  One or two important towns visited by Deputy Costello and I, such as Belmullet and Ballinrobe, are not included in the scheme, but I hope the situation will change in time.  I commend my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, including the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, Senator MacSharry, who made a strong case for ordering Bord G&aacute;is to change its cost benefit analysis.</P>
        <P>With good will, we must respond to the considered initiative because people want a resolution.  As Deputy Cowley said, we do not want a senior citizen or young person to be seriously injured on the Bellanaboy haulage road one morning.  The way forward is face-to-face talks without preconditions.  This is an important project for the nation, but we must work on it via agreement and we must respect the people of County Mayo, an important part of our country.  Behind this immediate issue is that of Ireland&rsquo;s natural resources, a matter in respect of which the Labour Party has expressed strong and considered views in its oil and exploration Bill, which is on the cl&aacute;r of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="445"/>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, I wish to clarify that his statutory responsibilities in this matter relate to the regulatory aspects of petroleum exploration and development.  I emphasise that in the case of the Corrib gas field, all of the required statutory approvals are in place.  These approvals were given subject to intense scrutiny of the various applications made to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and after the technical, safety and environmental aspects of the proposals were examined fully.</P>
        <P>Authorisations were granted for the Corrib gas field under a number of provisions.  Under the Continental Shelf Act 1968, authorisation was given for the construction of the sub-sea facilities.  Consent was also given for the plan of development of the field under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960.  Under the Gas Act 1976, as amended, consent was given for the construction of a gas pipeline from the gas field up to the terminal building.  A foreshore licence was also granted under the Foreshore Acts.  In accordance with EU directives, an environmental impact assessment statement was submitted with each application for consent or approval.  In addition, planning permission was granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the gas terminal.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that the Minister&rsquo;s function is a regulatory one, he has been endeavouring at every opportunity to create the conditions that would allow the difficulties associated with this project to be resolved with the assistance of independent bodies and individuals.</P>
        <P>Arising from local concerns about safety, the Minister had a further comprehensive safety review of the onshore upstream gas pipeline carried out by Advantica consultants last year.  Advantica is a world leader in the development and application of advanced hazard and risk assessment technologies for gas pipelines.</P>
        <P>It has been the priority of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that people who have views relating to the safety of the pipeline should have the opportunity to have those views considered by Advantica.  During the period of the review, opinions were invited from local residents, communities and any interested party during the period of the review.  A two-day public hearing was also held in the locality.  The draft safety review was presented to the community on 8 December and further comments were invited before the report was published.</P>
        <P>The Advantica report found that proper consideration to safety had been given in the selection process and for the project as a whole.  Moreover, the review found that so long as a number of measures were implemented, the project would carry a substantial safety margin and that both the pipeline and route should be accepted as meeting or exceeding international best practice.</P><Col N="446"/>
        <P>A separate technical advisory group, which supervised the safety review, made a series of further recommendations, covering, among other things, issues of design code, the drawing up of a pipeline integrity management plan and a range of measures on which the developer would have to gain approval to ensure that the actual construction and installation of the pipeline would be to the highest international standards.</P>
        <P>The Minister published the full details of all these recommendations in May of this year.  The developer, Shell, has accepted the recommendations made by both Advantica and the technical advisory group and has committed itself to meeting all of those requirements fully.  Shell has notified the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that it is well advanced with the additional work necessary to comply with these requirements.</P>
        <P>The Minister also appointed Mr. Peter Cassells as mediator in the dispute.  Mr. Cassells was appointed following consultation with the protestors and Shell.  Both sides agreed to this appointment and Mr. Cassells reported in July 2006.  Shell has accepted the recommendations made by the mediator.  It has indicated publicly that, in line with Mr Cassells&rsquo;s recommendations, it is considering alternative pipeline routes and will consult widely when it has come to a conclusion on the options.</P>
        <P>It is clear that Advantica, the technical advisory group and the Cassells report have dealt with all reasonable concerns relating to this project.  There is effectively nothing new in this latest idea for a further independent inquiry.</P>
        <P>I understand that the protestors have recently focused their concerns on the siting of the terminal at Bellanaboy.  The terminal has undergone a rigorous planning process over a three and a half year period following which An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted permission for the terminal.  The terminal has been the subject of two applications for planning permission to Mayo County Council, one of which followed an initial refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Deputies will appreciate that the availability of indigenous gas is becoming increasingly vital for the economy with world energy supplies diminishing and costs increasing sharply.  The Corrib gas field is a major infrastructural project, which has the potential to play a significant role in the economic and social regeneration of Mayo and the north west region.</P>

	<P>It will facilitate the improvement of the region&rsquo;s infrastructure and increase local employment, in both the short and long term.  The development will also increase Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply by providing a reliable, secure and indigenous source of gas.  The recent decision by the Commission for Energy <Col N="447"/>Regulation to extend the natural gas network to 11 towns along the route of its Mayo-Galway transmission pipeline is very welcome in this regard.  Athenry, Craughwell, Headford and Tuam in County Galway and Ballina, Ballyhaunis, Castlebar, Claremorris, Crossmolina, Knock and Westport in County Mayo will all benefit from new gas connections.  This has been made possible because of work undertaken by Bord G&aacute;is in anticipation of landing gas from Corrib and introducing it into the gas transmission network.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I assure the House, on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that <Col N="448"/>the Corrib has been a high priority, particularly over the past 18 months. He has listened carefully to the concerns of the local community, particularly with regard to safety issues, and has responded to those concerns, as I have outlined, with the help of appropriate independent bodies and individuals.</P>

	<P>The Western Development Commission (WDC) was consulted by the Department of Finance regarding the new National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 and submitted a very detailed and useful document in this regard highlighting a number of key issues.  Officials from that Department also met with representatives of the WDC earlier in the year to discuss their submission.</P>
        <P>With regard to my own Department, officials have had a number of high-level discussions with the Department of Finance regarding the new Plan and the programmes and measures that will be included in it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this context, the Deputy should also note that an Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by my Department, was established earlier this year to prepare a draft  chapter on the development of the rural economy for inclusion in the new Plan.  The Group sought to identify the main challenges specific to the rural economy in Ireland and the issues critical to its future development. It also considered existing and planned sectoral measures from across Departments that will significantly support or impact on the rural economy.</P><Col N="450"/>
        <P>The proposed chapter will reflect many of the key issues highlighted by the WDC in their submission.  I understand that the new NDP is now being finalised by the Department of Finance and will be published in January 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 194 together.</P>
        <P>The 10 Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) that have been established to include all parts of the country not covered by a Local Drugs Task Force are charged with researching, developing, implementing and monitoring a co-ordinated response to illicit drug use at regional level.</P>
        <P>The South West RDTF has responsibility for County Kildare, West Wicklow, and parts of South County Dublin and South Dublin City.  Its strategic plan outlines responses to illicit drug use across the region while focusing on specific problematic issues, such as pockets of illicit drug use and emerging needs.  The information emerging <Col N="451"/>locally, combined with information on drug prevalence and opiate use in the region, has provided the basis upon which projects were proposed and approved for funding.</P>
        <P>I was happy to make &euro;735,000 available to the South West RDTF in 2006 towards the implementation of its plan, with follow-up annual funding of over &euro;1.5m. Good progress has been achieved, with over half of the projects already commenced or due to commence by the end of the year.  Some ten projects have been approved for funding spanning the main pillars in the National Drugs Strategy &mdash; prevention, education, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  Of these, five projects, with approved full-year implementation costs of over &euro;1.1m, relate specifically to the provision of drug treatment programmes and rehabilitation.  These include the establishment of a Community Drug Team, to be based in Naas, and which will provide additional treatment places and ancillary treatment services in Kildare and West Wicklow.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied with the progress being made by the South West RDTF and by RDTFs generally.  There is an increasing level of co-operation and partnership evident in the regions as the RDTFs become more established.  Furthermore, the rate of progress being achieved has accelerated with the recruitment of full-time co-ordinators earlier this year. I am confident that significant results can be achieved in respect of Co. Kildare in the coming year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 40 and 43 together.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to launch the report, to which the Deputies refer, last week.  The campaign was brought about through a unique alliance of groups and agencies working on the frontline on <Col N="452"/>drugs issues in the area in question and funded by my Department through the Local Drugs Task Force.  The main function of the campaign was to gather information about drug dealing and to ensure that the information reached the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The Garda&iacute; have confirmed that much information was generated by the campaign, especially in its earlier stage, and that a significant amount of this information was useful.  Following on from the evaluation of the campaign, the steering group has proposed, as one of a number of recommendations, that the campaign be piloted nationwide.  The recommendations arising are now to be considered by the National Drugs Strategy Team and on receipt of their views I will consider the matter further.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In considering the matter going forward I will be particularly interested in the views of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It may be the case that initiatives such as this have maximum impact when strongly targeted at specific local areas for defined short periods, rather than being rolled out generally with no specific timeframe.</P>

	<P>Disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund are for the purpose of assisting three broad categories of persons &mdash; those who are economically or socially disadvantaged; those who are educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability.</P>
        <P>To date in 2006, the Government has approved the allocation of over &euro;13.4 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund to support a range of funding measures under the economic and social disadvantage heading.  In this regard, &euro;11.35 million has been approved to support 188 priority projects in RAPID areas; &euro;574,989 to support 6 projects providing services for vulnerable immigrant families; &euro;999,889 to support 20 suicide prevention projects; and &euro;502,722 to support 6 projects providing supports for prisoners and ex-prisoners.</P>
        <P>In relation to the funding approved to support prisoners and ex-prisoners, a total of &euro;250,004 has been allocated to provide addiction counselling services for prisoners in Dublin&rsquo;s prisons. In addition, a further &euro;252,718 has been approved in order to maximise the employment opportunities for prisoners in the Mountjoy and Midlands campuses and Castlerea and Cork prisons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not accept the view that the National Drug Strategy is failing.  Indeed, the main finding of the mid-term review of the Strategy was that the current aims and objectives were fundamentally sound and that progress was being made across all pillars of the Strategy.</P>
        <P>It would seem from newspaper reports that the Chief Executive of Merchants Quay Ireland, speaking at the launch of his organisation&rsquo;s 2005 report, deduced from the heavy demand on the services provided by them that there is a lack of development of local drugs services and an increased need for local needle exchange programmes.  He also noted that changing trends and <Col N="454"/>patterns in drug use, specifically relating to cocaine, have impacted on their services.</P>
        <P>With respect to local drug services, these have been developed in all Local Drug Task Force areas and are being developed throughout the country.  At the end of September 2006, the Central Treatment List indicated that 7,966 people with heroin problems were in receipt of methadone treatment and that the waiting list for treatment services was 156.  This latter figure represents a drop of 36% on the number recorded in September 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With respect to needle exchanges, an allocation of &euro;3m was made by the Department of Health and Children in 2006 for the further development of Harm Reduction Services.  I am informed by the HSE that needle exchange services are provided at a local level in each of the former Eastern Health Board areas and are currently being developed in other areas where there is likely to be a demand.</P>
        <P>With regard to the emerging trend of cocaine misuse, a joint briefing paper that I requested from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the National Drug Strategy Team was <Col N="455"/>received in September. I am currently awaiting responses from the relevant Agencies and Departments as to how the recommendations of the briefing paper might be addressed.</P>
        <P>I believe that there are encouraging signs of progress over the past couple of years &mdash; be it in the areas of drug seizures, expansion of treatment services, establishment of the Regional Drugs Task Forces, prevention programmes in schools and the very encouraging results of the Research Outcome Study in Ireland (ROSIE), which evaluated heroin treatment effectiveness. I am confident that the momentum built up around the various initiatives in the National Drugs Strategy will see them implemented within the appointed timescale, which runs to the end of 2008.</P>

        <P>However, in view of the concerns expressed in regard to the matter, I can confirm to the Deputy that officials from my Department met with senior management of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on 18th October last to seek clarification on issues relating to corporate governance.</P>
        <P>Arising from this meeting, a letter has now issued to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s setting out the Department&rsquo;s concerns in the matter and seeking a number of reassurances to ensure best practice prevails for the future.

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, <Col N="456"/>the CL&Aacute;R Programme is a targeted investment programme for rural areas.  Earlier this year, following a further analysis of the 2002 population census data, new areas were selected for inclusion in the Programme on the basis of average population loss in each county of not less than 35% between 1926 and 2002.  Towns of 3,000 and over and their peri-urban areas are excluded, irrespective of county decline in population.  The Programme now covers parts of 22 counties and all of Co. Leitrim and benefits a population of nearly 727,000.</P>
        <P>To meet the increased demands arising from the expansion, I secured an increase in CL&Aacute;R funding of approximately &euro;9m for 2006, bringing the overall level of funding available this year to &euro;22.95m.</P>
        <P>I feel that the approach being implemented under the Programme whereby small community and rural infrastructural projects are being supported &mdash; many of which might otherwise not be funded &mdash; is having a major impact on the lives of people living in the CL&Aacute;R areas.  I have no plans at present for a further review of the Programme.</P>

	<P>The National Monitoring Committee met on three occasions during 2006:  1st March, 1st June and 5th October.  It is likely that the Committee will meet again before the end of 2006.  In general, the major part of the deliberations of the Committee is the consideration of reports and updates from the Area Implementation Teams (AIT) for each RAPID area and from key Departments and Agencies.  The role of the Committee is to support the achievement of greater co-ordination and coherence in actions between the different agencies.</P>
        <P>An important element of each meeting is the input received from the ground via the AITs.  During the June and October meetings the Committee concentrated on the evaluation of the programme undertaken by Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants.  The business of the Committee will continue to focus on achieving timely implementation of the recommendations of this evaluation with particular concern to ensure the programme from 2007 addresses the weaknesses identified.</P>
        <P>The Committee has not considered the question of publication of the minutes of its meetings and it is an issue we can ask the members to reflect on at a future meeting.  Reports from the <Col N="457"/>AITs and the evaluation mentioned above are published.</P>

I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 1150 on 27 September 2006 in which I indicated that the Ulster Canal project was discussed with the Minister for Culture, Arts, and Leisure, Ms Maria Eagle, MP, when I met her on 19 June 2006. When I meet with Minister Eagle again, it will provide an opportunity for us to further explore the ways in which the re-development of the Ulster Canal can be progressed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 41 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In February of this year I announced the Local Authority Housing Estate Enhancement Scheme for 2007/2008.  Each of the RAPID areas has been allocated &euro;45,000 by my Department to match similar levels of funding to be provided by local authorities from their internal capital receipts and a further contribution of &euro;10,000 from their internal revenues.  Local authorities have been invited to make proposals for eligible works including landscaping, improvement of open spaces, seating areas, lighting, boundary walls and works to make open spaces in flat complexes amenable to recreational use.  The 2007/2008 scheme is the third series of funding for this purpose.</P>
        <P>The Terms and Conditions of the scheme allow local authorities sufficient time to consult with the RAPID Area Implementation Team in selecting and agreeing details of the projects to be proposed.  Local authorities are required to ensure delivery of the projects within a reasonable timeframe and the terms of the scheme are designed to support early execution.  Ideally, projects should be completed during 2007 or early 2008 at the latest.  Local authorities have been informed that they will be reimbursed for up to 50% of the costs of projects in 2007 and may be entitled to a higher level of funds if sufficient resources are available.  Any costs incurred by local authorities in 2007 and not recouped in that year can be claimed in 2008.</P>
        <P>I introduced the RAPID Leverage Schemes in 2004.  Through these schemes my Department, in partnership with other Departments and agencies, funds proposals to; provide playgrounds, institute traffic control measures, improve health facilities, support sporting infrastructure, install community CCTV systems as well as enhancing housing estates. The schemes are aimed at small-scale capital works &ndash; works that require relatively small amounts of funding but can produce real <Col N="459"/>and concrete benefits to the local communities in which they are delivered.  Importantly, these schemes allow the people who will be affected to have a direct input into influencing and deciding what projects will be undertaken.  The RAPID Area Implementation Team in each RAPID area plays a role in prioritising and selecting projects.</P>
        <P>It is not intended that the leverage scheme will be the full solution to the needs of many housing estates in RAPID areas.  However, the strength of these small schemes is that they are sufficiently flexible to address projects that are identified by people living in RAPID areas and that can make meaningful improvements to their quality of life.  Residents in RAPID areas are central to how projects are identified and prioritised.  In working with the local authority, short-term needs can be addressed that give immediate benefits.</P>
        <P>The recently published evaluation of the RAPID Programme indicates that the leverage schemes make an important contribution to the development of the Programme.  The schemes provided funding that could be linked directly to the Programme and encouraged greater buy in from local stakeholders as a result.</P>

        <P>In its report on a national countryside recreation strategy, Comhairle na Tuaithe raised a number of legal issues to be addressed, along with a proposal that the Law Reform Commission be requested to make recommendations on the broad issue of access to the countryside for recreational users.  Because of my concern to ensure that these issues are addressed as a matter of priority, I am establishing an expert group comprising, a leading Senior Counsel nominated by the Attorney General and a representative of the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my own Department to urgently advise on tackling each of the legal issues raised by Comhairle na Tuaithe in its report.</P>
        <P>I expect to receive the Attorney General&rsquo;s nomination of a Senior Counsel to chair the group over the coming days.  A draft Terms of Reference for the expert group is to be considered over the next week by the members of Comhairle na Tuaithe which include representatives of State bodies with an interest in the countryside, the farming organisations and recreational users of the countryside.</P>
        <P>I envisage that the expert group will report by the end April 2007 and that if the group considers that certain issues can be addressed in advance of that period that the group should prepare an interim report on those issues.</P>

	<P>I understand that the <Col N="462"/>findings of the survey referred to by the Deputy are to be presented to Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann (The Irish Islands Federation) for consideration.  While my Department has received a copy of the survey, I consider it would be appropriate to await the views of An Chomhdh&aacute;il as the representative organisation for all our inhabited offshore islands, before commenting on a survey such as this.</P>
        <P>In regard to island development policy in general, I should point out that my Department has been at the forefront in recent years in bringing forward proposals and introducing initiatives designed to reduce the cost of living for island communities and enhance their lifestyle accordingly.  Examples of practical steps that have been taken in this regard include:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />reduced maximum fares for island passengers on subsidised ferry services;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />50% reductions in cargo tariffs for the Aran Islands cargo service;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />substantially increased New House and House Improvement Grants on Gaeltacht islands; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />dedicated assistance schemes for enterprise development on non-Gaeltacht islands.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Another aspect of my Department&rsquo;s work is the co-ordination of Government policy in relation to the provision of State services on the islands.  Among the objectives achieved in this regard, which have had the effect of reducing the cost of living on the islands, are:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />an extra &euro;12.70 per week for old age pensioners and other categories of social welfare recipients living on the islands;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a special rate of &euro;66 in respect of road tax  and an exemption from the NCT for island based cars; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a significant increase in the Remote Area Boarding Grant payable by the Department of Education and Science in respect of island children attending secondary school on the mainland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While considerable progress has been made in dealing with cost of living issues, I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention to continue to examine ways of making further progress in this regard.</P>

	<P>The RAPID Prog<Col N="463"/>ramme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated RAPID areas.  In addition, RAPID priority status was recently extended to Ballyfermot. My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme.</P>
        <P>As already indicated to the House, following discussions with my Department, Pobal commissioned a formal evaluation of the programme the final report of which was launched on 1 June last.  The report indicates that the experience of the RAPID Programme has been very positive in many areas and the Programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in implementing important local projects in response to those needs. The report also indicates that since my Department took over the co-ordinating role in relation to the programme it has been very proactive in its development and has been a real driver of the changes which made the programme a more effective mechanism for addressing the problems of disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>As I have previously indicated, I believe that the RAPID Programme should continue into the future and that RAPID in its current form provides a long-term model to support disadvantaged communities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces <Col N="464"/>(RDTFs) have been established to include all parts of the country not covered by a Local Drugs Task Force, thus achieving full coverage of the country.  The RDTFs are charged with researching, developing, implementing and monitoring a co-ordinated response to illicit drug use at regional level.  Each Task Force has an independent Chairperson and is made up of representatives from the various Departments and agencies, as well as the community and voluntary sectors.  The RDTFs produced strategic plans for their respective regions, having regard to evi<Col N="465"/>dence available on the extent and specific location of illicit drug use in the region.</P>
        <P>An initial total allocation of &euro;5m has been approved in 2006 to the ten RDTFs to commence implementation of their plans. It is envisaged that funding will be increased on an incremental basis to achieve the full roll-out of the RDTF plans currently estimated to cost around &euro;12.2m on an annual basis.  Meanwhile, nine of the ten RDTFs now have full-time co-ordinators in place and the rate of progress is increasing.</P>
        <P>The National Drug Strategy Team has been working closely with the RDTFs to get their programmes up and running. A total of 68 projects have been initiated in 2006.  It is envisaged that around 80 projects will be in progress by the end of the year.  The projects involved range from prevention initiatives and work with youth to treatment services and outreach work.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied with the progress being made by the RDTFs and the increasing level of co-operation and partnership which is evident as they become more established.  I have no doubt that the rate of progress being achieved will accelerate over the coming year. I am arranging to have a list of the 68 initiated projects forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs is in the process of completing an update on Cocaine Use in Ireland and, while this research is still a work in progress, the indications are that the use of cocaine is increasing and that a small number of injecting drug users are combining cocaine and heroin (speedball).</P><Col N="466"/>
        <P>The National Drug Treatment Reporting System (NDTRS), which is an epidemiological database on treated problem drug and alcohol use in Ireland, reports 282 cases of the use of a mixture of heroin and cocaine administered by injection in 2003 (latest year for which figures are available).   While this represents an increase on previous years (e.g. 138 cases in 2000), it is clear that the practice is not a common occurrence.  However, it is very risky, tending to lead to increased and more risky injecting behaviour and greater risk of overdose.</P>
        <P>The NDTRS also reports on the number of cases of both heroin and cocaine being used as the first and second problem substances.   In the six years from 1998 to 2003 a total of 2,620 such cases were reported, again with an increasing trend, with 742 cases reported in 2003.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the NDTRS figures are case based, rather than representing individuals.  As some clients use more that one service as part of their treatment, the number of individuals involved may be less than the case figures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Through the implementation structures of the National Drugs Strategy, my officials have ongoing contact with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the prevalence of crack cocaine in the country is among the issues discussed from time to time.  I also periodically meet senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to review developments in regard to illicit drugs.</P>
        <P>The Garda&iacute; have reported a slight increase in the quantity of crack cocaine seized in the jurisdiction over the past two years. However, this represents a small proportion of the total number of cocaine seizures recorded annually.</P>
        <P>The Garda&iacute; are satisfied that the use of crack cocaine is largely confined to a small geographical area in Dublin.  Furthermore, they have had some success in targeting the supply and use of this drug in that area.   Also, in my visits to various Drugs Task Force areas in the past year or so, the issue of crack cocaine did not arise to any great extent in my discussions with community representatives and others on the nature of the drug problem in their regions.</P>
        <P>I am confident that, through the implementation of the actions in the National Drugs Strategy, the projects and initiatives operated through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces and the operations of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the problem of crack cocaine use can be, and is <Col N="467"/>being, addressed.  Each of the Drugs Task Forces has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in their area, based on their own identified priorities, and they continue to have ongoing contact with their local communities.</P>
        <P>However, I fully accept that a potential danger exists that the use of crack cocaine could spread. I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to monitor the situation and that I will ensure that any necessary steps are taken to address increased threats, should they arise.</P>

        <P>As I indicated in previous replies to Questions in the House, the Board of Foras na Gaeilge has been asked to bring forward firm proposals in relation to the phases of locating a staff complement of 30 in Gaoth Dobhair, as well as the precise sections and functions to be located there. The current position is that a detailed business case in relation to the filling of a number of posts, including posts to be located in Gaoth Dobhair, is being prepared by Foras na Gaeilge and will, I understand, be submitted shortly. Once the business case has been examined and approved by the North-South Ministerial Council, arrangements for the location of Foras staff in Gaoth Dobhair will proceed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The recently published report of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) to which the Deputy refers related to the areas of Charitable Trusts and of Legal Structures for Charities. </P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of Charitable Trusts, the Deputy will be aware that, following the publication by my Department of its Consultation Paper on Establishing a Modern Statutory Framework for Charities, the LRC agreed to assist my Department on aspects of the proposed new framework, in particular the role and function of charity trustees. I am glad to be able to confirm to the Deputy that the General Scheme for the Charities Regulation Bill, which was published in March last, was informed in a number of aspects by the work of the LRC in the area of charitable law. Indeed, I informed the House in response to Question No. 89 of 26 Deireadh F&oacute;mhair 2005, following the conclusion of the LRC consultation process on its proposals for the reform of charitable trust law, that my Department had been fully apprised as to the outcome of the LRC deliberations in this regard. The Deputy may wish to note that in its recent report the LRC acknowledges that the draft Charities Bill 2006 incorporates many of the provisional recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Consultation Paper on Charitable Trust Law.</P>
        <P>The recent LRC report also examines the need for a new legal structure for charities in Ireland. As I have already informed the House, the matter of legal structures for charities does not constitute the purpose of the proposed Charities Regulation Bill, which is to regulate the charities sector for the first time since the foundation of the State.  Under the Agreed Programme for Government, there is a commitment to ensure accountability of the charities sector and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.  That is the commitment on which the Charities Regulation Bill will deliver.</P>
        <P>I should add that since publication of the General Scheme for the Charities Regulation Bill, the feedback from the charities sector has been favourable.  The General Scheme has been called a hugely positive step in the right direction.  A welcome has also been given to our stated intention that the legal structure of those charities which are companies limited by guarantee under existing company law will not hinder compliance with the new legislation. The proposed Charities Regulation Bill will also ensure that dual registration and dual filing of annual returns, such as <Col N="469"/>with both the future Charities Regulator and the Companies Registration Office, will be avoided where corporate charities are concerned.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to two programmes in particular that my Department manages that are relevant in this regard.  Firstly, under the CL&Aacute;R Programme, my Department co-funds a number of measures with a range of other Departments/Agencies such as: Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Local authorities; Department of Education and Science; Health Services Executive; Department of Communications, Marine and National Resources; and Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The various measures under the Programme support a range of local and community infrastructural developments such as village/housing/ schools enhancement, electricity conversion, roads, water supply, sewage disposal, health, coastal, sports and community projects.   The content of each of the measures and how they operate is agreed in advance with the relevant Department/Agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Secondly, in the implementation of the Rural Social Scheme, my Department is in regular contact with the Dept of Social and Family Affairs as the Scheme is aimed at providing support to low-income farmers and fishermen who are in receipt of long-term social welfare payments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy should also note that my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Food, is currently drafting the new Rural Development Programme 2007-2013.  At least &euro;60m per year will be available under the Programme through a combination of European and National funding.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy should note that my Department is represented on all inter-departmental committees where issues relevant to rural communities are being discussed.</P>

	<P>An Foras Teanga comprises Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency.  The Board of the Foras Teanga has 24 members appointed by North South Ministerial Council (NSMC).  Of those members &mdash; (a) 16 are drawn from among persons appearing to NSMC to have an interest in, or experience of, matters relating to the functions of the Body in relation to the Irish Language; and (b) 8 are drawn from among persons appearing to NSMC to have an interest in, or experience of, matters relating to the functions of the Body in relation to Ullans and Ulster Scots cultural issues.  One member from each Agency is appointed by NSMC as Chairperson of that Agency and they will act as joint Chairpersons of the Body.</P>
        <P>Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge was established in 1952.  It has 12 members. All  board appointments including the Chairperson are made by the Minister.  Members are drawn from among persons appearing to the Minister to have an interest in, or experience of, matters relating to the functions of the Bord.  The Board&rsquo;s remit is to develop and foster writing and publishing in the Irish Language.</P>
        <P>An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha (The Placenames Commission) was established in 1946. It currently has 15 members. The remit of the Commission is to advise on the research of the placenames of Ireland and on providing authoritative Irish  versions of those names for official and public use.  Appointments to the Commission including the Chairperson are made by the Minister.  Members are drawn from among persons appearing to the Minister to have an interest in, or experience of, matters relating to the functions of the Commission.</P>
        <P>The Charities Act 1961 outlines the procedure in place for the appointment of the chairperson and the Board members of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  Section 8(1) states that &ldquo;the Government shall appoint persons to be members of the Board from time to time as occasion requires&rdquo; and 8(5) states that &ldquo;...as occasion requires, the Board shall appoint a member of the Board to be the Chairman of the Board...&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Articles of Association of Pobal provide that the Government appoints the members of the Board having regard to a balance of: Persons with significant expertise and participation in local, urban and rural development, social inclusion, community development and equality issues; Persons with significant expertise and experience in one or more of the following fields: business, trade unions, financial management, <Col N="471"/>social and/or economic policy and the appraisal of strategic plans and/or grant applications; equality of gender, that all reasonable endeavour is used to ensure that 40% of the Board membership comprise either gender; and appropriate geographical spread covering both urban and rural communities.  In order to achieve these objectives, Article 3 of the Articles of Association requires the Minister to consider nominations received from a list of stakeholders defined by the Government.  The stakeholders are: The Social Partners, Area and Community Partnerships, County Childcare Committees, and the County and City Managers Association.  Where vacancies arise on the Board, the Minister, in the first instance, requests nominations from each of the stakeholders and upon receipt of nominations makes proposals to the Government to appoint persons to achieve an overall balance of representation as required by the Articles of Association.</P>
        <P>In the case of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the relevant legislation provides that the Minister will appoint the Chairperson and two members to the board while the remaining 17 board members will be elected by the Gaeltacht community.  The legislation further provides that the person appointed as chairperson shall have such special skills or experience as the Minister considers appropriate having regard to the functions of the body and shall not have stood as a candidate in the last election.</P>
        <P>The Chairperson and members of the Dormant Accounts Board are appointed by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in accordance with Section 32 of the Dormant Accounts Acts 2001 to 2005</P>
        <P>The Western Development Commission Act 1998 provides that the Minister will appoint the Chairperson and 11 ordinary members, with the consent of the Minister of Finance. The legislation further provides that the chairperson and ordinary members will hold office for a period of 3 years from the date of his or her appointment.</P>

	<P>The Ministerial meeting to which the Deputy refers was held in Na Forbacha, Galway on 27 October last and was attended by representatives from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.  As Wales is the lead administration for the Indigenous, Minority and Lesser-Used Languages Group within the British-Irish Council, the meeting was chaired by the Welsh Minister for Culture, Welsh Language and Sport.</P>
        <P>As is outlined in the agreed communiqu&eacute; issued by the Ministers from the member administrations, the meeting considered and approved 3 discussion papers relating to: Language Transmission within the Family; Information and Communications Technology and Indigenous, Minority and Lesser-Used Languages; and Adult Education Provision for the Teaching and Learning of the Indigenous, Minority and Lesser-Used Languages.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As well as continuing to advance work in these three areas in the future, the Group will also focus on two new areas, namely: Planning and Linguistic Considerations; and Research, Data and Language Use Surveys.</P>
        <P>I am very encouraged by the work being done on an ongoing basis under the auspices of the Indigenous, Minority and Lesser Used Languages Group of the British-Irish Council and I look forward to a continuing process of information exchange and mutual learning, both at official and Ministerial levels.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be interested to note that a practitioner&rsquo;s conference on the theme of Language Transmission within the Family was held the day prior to the Ministerial meeting and that this was also considered to be a great success.</P>

	<P>The key objective in allocating funds from Dormant Accounts is to ensure that disbursements are targeted at those most in need in society.  Funding from Dormant Accounts is designed to complement the range of Government programmes that address economic, social and educational disadvantage and assist persons with a disability.</P>
        <P>An innovative feature of the 2006 round of Dormant Accounts Funding is the provision of up to &euro;10 million for flagship projects that can attract significant private, philanthropic or community based funding.  This funding measure has the potential to release significant amounts of matching funding from such sources and will have a very positive impact in tackling disadvantage and assisting persons with a disability.  There is a widely held belief that as individual wealth increases as a result of our economic successes, philanthropy has a bigger part to play in addressing inequalities in society.  Applications under this funding measure were invited on 18th October 2006 and as soon as these applications are fully processed, announcements will be made detailing the specific groups and organisations that have been successful.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that these will be initiatives addressing matters of major public concern and/or headline policy interventions for which funding from private philanthropic or community sources can be levered.  The nature of projects to be funded will be determined by the proposals submitted.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to relocating 140 posts to new headquarters at Knock Airport.  OPW have indicated that the headquarters building will be in place there by mid 2008.  To further the decentralisation process, 68 posts have been assigned to temporary offices in Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo, which opened in July of this year.  The intention is that these posts will be relocated to Knock Airport when the new building is ready.</P>
        <P>I believe that the significant inward investment associated with the decentralisation of the Department can help provide an impetus to Knock Airport to become a regional development hub, building on the advantages the airport has in terms of location, accessibility, and the investment and infrastructure already in place there.  Once the new Departmental headquarters is built, it will be a very powerful and concrete example of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the region which will inspire additional private investment.</P>
        <P>The socio-economic benefits will also be felt in all of the towns in the airport&rsquo;s hinterland through the provision of services to the airport and to the Department.  There will be benefits also for those towns as places where those working in the airport area will be living as active members of their new communities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>The study referred to by the Deputies, which was commissioned by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) under Action 98 of the National Drugs Strategy, was an exploratory study of relatively small scale, aimed at assessing the nature and extent of drug use amongst the Traveller Community in Ireland. The study shows that Travellers are a community for whom the risk of drug use, and its consequent problems, is now emerging.</P>
        <P>Broadly, the study found that patterns of drug use amongst the Traveller community are similar to the general population. Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug, followed by cocaine and ecstasy; more men than women are involved; and usage of illegal drugs is largely confined to younger adults (aged 15 to 34).</P>
        <P Just="Left">The risk factors for drug misuse among Travellers include issues such as educational progression, health, employment opportunities, accommodation and criminal justice issues.  It is reported that lack of knowledge about drugs and drug services has hampered Travellers&rsquo; responses to drug problems, including tackling drug dealing.  Also, cultural issues can affect the degree to which they access drug services, as can experiences of social exclusion among this community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recognise that, as with the general population, social deprivation can be a key factor affecting drug use among Travellers and that the issues that have been identified will need to be considered and addressed appropriately. While acknowledging that the report recognises a number of issues affecting Traveller take-up of services, I would be disappointed if discrimination and stereotyping were having a significant impact in this regard. The projects developed under the Drug Task Force programme have always sought to be inclusive of all communities.</P>
        <P>Arising from the report, the NACD is holding a series of meetings with Traveller groups and will be issuing its report in consultation with the National Drugs Strategy Team to all Local and Regional Drug Task Forces.  Meanwhile, the National Drugs Strategy Team will be taking the <Col N="477"/>findings of the report on board with respect to the future development of services for Travellers.  The report will also be brought to the attention of the High Level Group on Travellers.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to working with Traveller groups through the relevant Department and Agencies to address the issue of drug misuse in the Traveller Community.</P>

        <P>My Department and the bodies under its aegis co-operate with colleagues in Northern Ireland on an ongoing basis in relation to various aspects of the National Drugs Strategy.</P>
        <P>Prominent among the more formal links is the work of the British-Irish Council Sectoral Group on the Misuse of Drugs.  As the Deputy is aware, the British Irish Council (BIC) is a forum for the exchange of information and best practice and arose from the Good Friday Agreement.  Members of the BIC include the British and Irish Governments, the devolved institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.  Ireland is the lead administration in relation to the Misuse of Drugs sector. The Sectoral Group, chaired by a representative of my Department, meets four to five times each year, with administrations hosting meetings on a rotational basis.  The last meeting of the Group took place on 3 November in Belfast on the subject of cocaine.  A BIC Ministerial Meeting, which I will chair, will take place on this issue in Belfast on 7 December next.</P>
        <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the Drug and Alcohol Information and Research Unit (Northern Ireland) worked together to commission the first Drugs Prevalence Survey in 2002/2003, the purpose of which was to establish the population prevalence of drug use on the island of Ireland.  This study surveyed over 8,000 people in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Work on the second joint Drug Prevalence Survey has begun and it is expected that a first report of national prevalence figures and trends will be available in the latter part of 2007.</P><Col N="478"/>
        <P>On a broader level, there is ongoing co-operation between various agencies involved in the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.  For example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) co-operate on an ongoing basis in tackling the problem of drug trafficking across both jurisdictions, which resulted in searches, arrests and seizures of drugs with an estimated street value of &euro;1.75m in 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, the fourth cross-border seminar on organised crime took place in Limavaddy, Co. Derry, on 9 and 10 October 2006. The purpose of the seminar, which was organised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Office, was to enhance co-operation between North and South in tackling cross-border criminality.</P>
        <P>Delegates included representatives from various units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the UK&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the Customs Branch of the Revenue Commissioners, the Northern Ireland Office, and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the situation on which the Deputy&rsquo;s question is based is a particular and localised one and affects approximately 40/45 individuals with socially-monitored alarms in Co. Westmeath, where the 04 STD area underwent a number change under the &lsquo;National Numbering Scheme&rsquo;, which is managed and administered by ComReg.</P>
        <P>My Department has been in contact with the local groups and I understand that this number (40/45) of socially-monitored alarms which were funded by my Department under the Scheme of Community Supports for Older People (CSOP), may have been affected due to their particular technical nature. The CSOP is administered by local community and voluntary groups. The vast majority of such alarm holders use a system involving the centralised monitoring of the alarms by the commercial suppliers. In these instances an annual monitoring fee of approximately &euro;80 is payable by the user and my information is that such systems are not adversely affected by the STD code change. In the case of the system affected by the STD area code change, the community group opted to use a system that does not involve centralised monitoring of the alarms by the commercial suppliers thereby avoiding the annual monitoring charge paid by most users but necessitating the reprogramming as a result of the change in the STD code.</P>
        <P>My Department has no direct involvement with the commercial suppliers of these alarms as this is dealt with by the local community groups, and my Department was not contacted regarding this matter by the community group who had arranged for the installation of these particular alarms. However, I understand from my Department&rsquo;s contacts locally that it should be possible to have the work arising from the STD area code change completed for a considerably lower fee <Col N="480"/>than that indicated by the Deputy. This would also be considerably less than the monitoring fee that is payable annually by the vast majority of socially-monitored alarm holders.</P>

	<P>Regarding the status of the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 48 of 5th October, 2006.</P>
        <P>The current status of funding schemes under the White Paper is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Under the Funding Scheme to Support the Role of Federations, Networks and Umbrella bodies, 32 groups have been funded to a total of &euro;6.78m over three and a half years;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Under the funding Scheme for Training and Supports, 20 projects have been funded to a total of &euro;2.13m over three and a half years;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The National Anti-Poverty Networks have been funded to a total of &euro;4.8m over three and a half years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Funding under these schemes will continue until mid-2007. In the meantime, my Department is in the process of reviewing these existing White Paper funding arrangements and it is intended that new funding arrangements to take forward the principles of the White Paper will be advertised towards the end of this year. These will then be implemented from the cessation of the current schemes.</P>
        <P>Another important area of activity under the White Paper is volunteering:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />My Department is responsible for core funding totalling &euro;624,000 provided to 9 Volunteer Bureaux;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />In addition, funding of &euro;150,000 has been provided over three years to Volunteer Centres Ireland for the employment of a Development Officer. A key task for the Development Officer is to develop reliable statistical data on volunteering to inform further initiatives, and to support the further development of Volunteer Bureaux;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A further &euro;500,000 of local area partnership funding is being ring-fenced for measures that encourage volunteers and volunteering;</P><Col N="481"/>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A further &euro;500,000 of the Department&rsquo;s Cohesion Fund will be spent on measures that will promote volunteers and volunteering locally.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Funding totalling &euro;800,000 over three years is being provided to support the Young Social Innovators programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 179 together.</P>
        <P>The Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund was established in 1998 to assist in the development of facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem existed or had the potential to develop.</P><Col N="482"/>
        <P>While some of the expenditure is for capital work on the provision of facilities, the greater part involves current expenditure on the staffing and running costs of community facilities, particularly the employment of dedicated Youth Workers to deliver activities which are specifically aimed at attracting &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into activities that will divert them from the dangers of substance misuse.</P>
        <P>To date, the focus of the Fund has been in the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas (12 in Dublin and the others in Bray and Cork City) which were established in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly misuse of heroin, as well as on four other urban centres, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Carlow.  Overall approximately &euro;107m has been allocated to support projects employing around 325 people.</P>
        <P>Some evaluation of the Fund has been carried out in the past, on both an internal and external basis.  Generally feedback from the projects, and from others in the communities concerned, suggest that the initiatives funded have had a significant positive impact on the young people involved.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the provision of alternative positive and healthy activities and pastimes for young people at risk represents one of the best ways of avoiding their getting involved in the drug culture.  It is so much better to prevent a young person becoming involved in the misuse of drugs rather than becoming involved at a later stage to address major problems for that person, his or her family and the local community.</P>
        <P>Indeed, the possibility of expanding the number of urban areas that are eligible for funding from the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund may be considered in the coming period.  Any decision in that regard will be based on evidence of a significant existing drug problem in a particular centre, or the potential for a drug problem to develop there.</P>

	<P>Arising from the joint ministerial initiative on the review of local and community development structures, the Government agreed a series of measures in January 2004 designed to improve arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered and improve cohesion and focus across various measures. Since then, I have directed the <Col N="483"/>cohesion process, which is informed by the following guiding principles:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Improving on the ground services</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Streamlining structures so as to avoid overlaps, duplication and undue administrative overheads</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Bringing transparency, co-ordination and improved control to the funding and operation of local and community development measures</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and providers in this area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As a first step towards improving on the ground services, City and County Development Boards (CDBs) were mandated to oversee the cohesion process at local level and to facilitate the development of cohesion proposals by local agencies. During 2004, a total of &euro;3,248,600 was allocated to the CDBs and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in respect of proposals aimed at improving linkages between local agencies, support multi-agency actions and promote sharing of resources to maximise the impact of available funding.</P>
        <P>The 2005/2006 phase of the process aims to improve the alignment of local and community development agencies by the end of this year in a way that removes any overlaps and duplication and maximises available resources for the benefit of local communities.   The intention is that, from 2007, there will be one unified local development structure providing full coverage in any given area and fewer structures overall in the country.  The major advantage of such an approach is that the State will be able to deliver programmes such as the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) and Rural Social Scheme through these new unified structures because they will have all-area cover.</P>
        <P>My preference is for unified overarching structures based around county boundaries where practicable. However, I am prepared to consider variations across county boundaries on their merits.</P>
        <P>In 2005, a total of &euro;4,836,927 was allocated from the cohesion fund, including &euro;1,463,400 for volunteering.  To date in 2006, a total of &euro;3,852,862 of cohesion funding has been awarded including &euro;76,600 for volunteering.  The actions funded under the current round are primarily focused on actions related to the alignment of local development structures, including facilitation, technical assistance, legal advice, corporate planning and training and development of staff.  Funding has also been provided for joint service delivery to underpin collaborative actions by agencies directly involved in re-aligning their structures.</P>
        <P>At this stage, 23 of the local authority areas and na Gaeltachta&iacute; have fully agreed the integrated <Col N="484"/>structures which will provide full coverage.  Discussions are continuing in the remaining areas.</P>
        <P>In the context of strengthening the democratic accountability of local development agencies, I intend to put in place new requirements governing the membership of the management structures of the new companies.  In this regard, I have asked CDBS, LEADER groups and Partnership companies to provide their views on a draft discussion document setting out a possible composition of the new structures by 16 November.</P>

	<P>The Transportation Network meeting of the European Small Islands Network (ESIN), which was held on the island of Gr&auml;s&ouml;, Sweden, on 22-23 August 2006, was attended by a senior official from my Department.  The purpose of the meeting was to examine and compare the provision of transport services to small islands in a number of countries, including Sweden, Finland, Denmark, France, Scotland and Ireland.</P>
        <P>The meeting afforded participants the opportunity to gain increased understanding of the varied approaches that pertain in the different countries and to learn from examples of good practice.  Presentations were given outlining the current position in each of the participating countries and a series of workshops facilitated further discussion on   particular aspects relating to island transport services.</P>
        <P>I welcome the active involvement of my Department in meetings of this nature in view of the continued improvements that have been made to our island transport services over the past number of years.  Through the provision of State subsidies and enhanced monitoring of contract delivery, our island communities now enjoy regular access services.  Initiatives that I have taken recently &mdash; such as the capping of passenger fares for islanders on all island services and the halving of the Aran Islands cargo tariffs &mdash; have been widely welcomed and the planned introduction of additional cargo services to a number of islands will further enhance the quality of life for island communities.</P>
        <P>I should add also that, in addition to participating in the ESIN meeting, my officials have had discussions recently with the Department for Regional Development and other interested parties in Northern Ireland in regard to island ferry services and they have also been in communi<Col N="485"/>cation with officials from the Scottish Executive on matters of common interest.</P>

	<P>The 3-Source Capture Recapture Study of the prevalence of opiate use in Ireland, published by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) in May 2003, was the source of the information.  It estimated that 14,452 people in Ireland were using heroin in the 2000/01 period.  Of these 12,456 were in the greater Dublin area.  This represented a decrease on a 1996 figure, which estimated that 13,461 people were using heroin in the greater Dublin area.  The overall rate per 1,000 population was 5.6, with Dublin having a recorded rate of 16.0 per 1,000 in 2001 and the Rest of Ireland showing a rate of 1.0 per 1,000.</P>
        <P>While comparative figures have not been produced in the intervening period, there is a general consensus that with respect to opiate use that the numbers have stabilised.  A new study is at planning stage and, furthermore, the current all-island Drugs Prevalence Survey, from which first results <Col N="486"/>will appear in the latter part of 2007, will indicate the overall trends on the use of heroin and other illicit drugs.</P>

	<P>Work is well advanced on the preparation of a call to the market for expressions of interest in tendering for the project.  Following the call for expressions of interest, a number of candidates will be awarded pre-qualification status and short-listed to proceed to the next stage.  A request for tenders will be made to the short-listed candidates, and the successful candidate will be selected on the basis of the tenders received.  In relation to the cost of implementing speed cameras the selection of an outsource provider will be made by way of an open and competitive tendering process.  In accordance with EU and national procurement guidelines the Invitation for Expression of Interest will be published in the EU journal and on the Government&rsquo;s procurement website.  All responses received will be evaluated on an individual basis in accordance with the criteria set down in the Expressions of Interest document. I am not in a position at this time to indicate to the Deputy the potential cost of the project as this will depend, <i>inter alia</i>, on the tenders ultimately received.  I assure the Deputy that I attach a very high priority to outsourcing and expanding the speed camera network and to ensuring there will be no undue delay in the procurement process.  I expect that, subject to negotiations, the contract for safety cameras will be awarded and the start up phase commence as early as possible next year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The person concerned arrived in the State on 3 January, 2002, (with a valid entry visa and work permit), in order to take up employment. However after approximately one month the person concerned left his employment resulting in the cancellation of the aforementioned work permit. Subsequently the person concerned left the State but returned in July, 2002, without a valid entry visa and secured employment in the &lsquo;black economy&rsquo; until he came to the attention of the Garda&iacute; in October, 2004, when he was arrested. As a direct consequence of this, the arresting Garda requested my Department to issue him a Notification under Section 3 (4) Immigration Act, 1999, which was duly issued to him on 15 November, 2004, which afforded him three options: to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order against him; to make representations for temporary leave to remain in the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsequently his case was examined under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and I duly signed a Deportation Order in respect of him on 22 December, 2005, which issued to him, by registered post, on 26 January, 2006, requesting him to present to the Garda National immigration Bureau, (GNIB), on 02 February, 2006, so that arrangements could be made for his deportation from the State. However he failed to present to the GNIB as requested and was recorded as having evaded his deportation.   He subsequently came to the attention of the Garda&iacute; and a second letter was served <Col N="491"/>on him by hand on 14 March, 2006, and he was subsequently deported to the Ukraine on 3 May, 2006.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was afforded the opportunity to make representations to my Department prior to my signing the Deportation Order in respect of him, but did not avail of this opportunity.  However, he can apply to my Department to have the Deportation Order revoked.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is in the process of making an appointment to the post of Director of Investigations. I understand that the successful candidate is a senior Police Officer from outside the jurisdiction. Competitions for the posts of Deputy Director of Investigations (1), Senior Investigations Officer (6), Investigations Officer (12) and Assistant Investigations Officer (9) are currently being conducted by the Public Appointments Service. The job descriptions for these posts emphasise the independence of the Commission and its statutory objectives which are to ensure that complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are examined &ldquo;with full fairness to all persons involved in complaints and investigations&rdquo; and to &ldquo;promote public confidence in the process for resolving those complaints&rdquo;. Can<Col N="492"/>didates are also required to possess a full understanding of and commitment to the fundamental principles of human rights and a comprehensive understanding of the environment within which the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission will operate.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is independent in the performance of its functions and I have no role in the selection process. As these are public open competitions, the Public Appointments Service, with the participation of the Commission, will select the most suitable candidates.</P>

	<P>I propose to deal with Questions Nos. 83 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently two members based at Castlebar Garda Station dedicated to the investigation of drug offences, assisted by members from each of the Garda Districts within the Mayo Garda Division. In addition, it is the responsibility of every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement drugs legislation.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that plans by local Garda management are at an advanced stage to establish a dedicated Divisional Drugs Unit in Mayo, comprising of one Sergeant  and four Garda&iacute; and the unit is expected to be in place in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In relation to the specific statistical information in relation to drugs offences being sought by the Deputy, it has not been possible, within the timeframe available, to collate such information.  I will contact the Deputy directly when the information is to hand.</P>
        <P>In terms of the Government&rsquo;s overall response to tackling the issue of drug misuse, I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains resolutely committed to addressing the problem through our National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.</P><Col N="493"/>
        <P>The National Strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.</P>

        <P>Another feature of the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to ensure that the drugs problem is addressed on a nationwide basis. In this regard, Regional Drug Task Forces in ten designated areas, coterminous with the previous Health Board areas were established during 2003.</P>
        <P>The Regional Drug Task Forces bring together statutory and voluntary organisations to work with local community and public representatives to ensure that a co-ordinated response to tackle the problem of drug misuse is in place within their regions. The Mayo county area comes under the remit of the Western Regional Drug Task Force.</P>
        <P>Finally I can assure the Deputy that the trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs at local, national and international levels will continue to be constantly monitored by the Garda&iacute;.</P>

        <P>The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not exempt the person from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long-term residency.</P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</P>
        <P>I understand that applications received in May, 2006 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Prison <Col N="496"/>Service is committed to helping prisoners to develop their sense of responsibility and to encourage those attitudes and skills which will assist them to return to society with the best chance of leading law abiding and self-supporting lives after release.</P>
        <P>Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory services.  Among these are healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.</P>
        <P>Rehabilitation programmes are delivered by a wide range of specialist services that operate in the prisons, such as psychologists, teachers, probation and welfare officers and prison officers.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Education</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">Education in prisons is provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  Since the 1990s, most Prison Education Units have become involved in courses on pre-release, post-release, health education, addiction awareness, anger management, group skills and parenting etc.  Very often such courses or activities are run on a multi-disciplinary basis. This service involved 210 whole-time-equivalent teachers who work in the prisons and whose salaries are paid from the Vote of the Department of Education and Science. In addition, in 2005 &euro;1.37 million was expended on this service from the Prisons Vote of my Department.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Work Training</i></P>
        <P>The Work Training programme operates at each prison.  As well as organising necessary services such as catering and laundry, it also provides work and training opportunities for prisoners whilst ensuring a high quality of service delivery within the prison.  Work Training provides structured pre-vocational and vocational training so that persons in custody can acquire the skills that may help them to obtain employment after their release.   A total of &euro;0.94 million was expended on Work and Training in 2005 with a further &euro;0.55 million being expended on Manufacturing.  These figures do not, however, include the salaries of the over 200 staff engaged in these activities in the prisons and who are paid from <Col N="497"/>the Prisons Vote.  This service is currently being expanded with dedicated new resources and staffing.</P>

       <P el="10"><i>Probation Service</i></P>
        <P>This Service has an active role during the course of the prisoner&rsquo;s sentence in helping maintain links with family and community agencies, encouraging prisoners to address their offending behaviour and engaging prisoners in individual counselling and group counselling programmes such as offending behaviour, addiction, violence and sex offending.  The Service also provides supervision in certain cases under temporary release provisions.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Chaplaincy Service</i></P>
        <P>Prison Chaplains promote the spiritual and pastoral welfare of prisoners and also participate with other services in the secular care of prisoners.  The work of the Chaplaincy Service involves extensive contact with prisoners on personal and family matters as well as other issues which arise in relation to their confinement in prison.</P>
     <P el="10"><i>Psychology Service</i></P>
        <P>The principal aim of this service is to provide, in co-operation with others, a generic therapeutic service to prisoners aimed at addressing their psychological needs and at reducing re-offending.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Drug Treatment</i></P>
        <P>Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  The programmes seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, an information forum, addiction counselling, drug therapy programmes and the operation of drug-free areas.</P>
        <P>The new Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy &mdash; Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons &mdash; will see existing drug treatment programmes being expanded and enhanced with the further recruitment of psychologists and addiction counsellors as well as other staff.   The Irish Prison Service expended almost &euro;3 million (excluding staff costs) on the provision of medical services to the prisoner population in 2005 but it is not possible to disaggregate, with any degree of accuracy, from this total, the element that related solely to the treatment of prisoners with drug problems.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Sex Offender Programmes</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level <Col N="498"/>in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention.  In this regard, there are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention currently available &mdash; i.e. individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Psychology Service and from the Probation Service; the Sex Offender Programme which has been in operation since 1994, and the Psychiatric Service which provides some support to prisoners in this category.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Knock Airport does not have a permanent Customs presence. Mobile enforcement staff, including a sniffer dog, attend incoming and outward flights as necessary based on risk-focussed criteria.</P>
        <P>Flights into and out of Knock are, for the most part, intra-EU.  Since 1993 Customs Authorities are not permitted to impose systematic checks on travellers whose point of origin is within the EU.  In effect intra-EU flights have been regarded as domestic since 1993.  Selective customs checks of such flights for prohibited goods can be carried out only on the basis of &ldquo;reasonable grounds for suspicion&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Based on the level of traffic, control of the airport using mobile enforcement staff is considered adequate. During the first nine months of this year there were 3,517 incoming flights (an average of approximately 13 flights per day), mainly from other EU states, carrying 264,000 passengers. Unannounced customs interventions took place in respect of 510 of these flights. A sniffer dog was used at the airport on 64 days during this period.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s assessment of the risks of drugs smuggling through airports &mdash; and the deployment of Customs staff to meet those risks &mdash; is kept continuously under review.  I am also conscious of our obligations to our EU partners in the fight against drug trafficking and this is reflected in the action points contained in the supply reduction pillar of our own National Drugs Strategy.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs Service provides a 24 hour-seven day presence at Dublin Airport.  In the two other main airports, Cork and Shannon, the Customs presence is not on a 24/7 basis as the volume of flights and the risk assessment does not justify such a presence.  For example in some instances there are periods of up to 6 hours where there are no flights arriving.  In the circumstances the deployment a permanent 24/7 Customs presence would be neither justified nor cost-effective.  In the case of both of these airports mobile anti-smuggling teams are however available to cover the risk outside of the hours where there is a Customs presence.</P>
        <P>At regional airports and licensed aerodromes, flights for the most part are either domestic or intra-EU.  Since 1993 Customs Authorities are not permitted to impose systematic checks on travellers whose point of origin is within the EU.  In effect, intra-EU flights have been regarded as domestic since 1993.  Selective customs checks of such flights for prohibited goods can be carried out only on the basis of &ldquo;reasonable grounds for suspicion&rdquo;.  Arrivals at regional and licensed aerodromes are assessed on a risk basis and Customs attendance is given in response to this assessment by mobile anti-smuggling teams (including detector dogs).  In relation to the adequacy of Customs controls that are in place in licensed aerodromes, I can advise the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners are already conducting a review of this whole area of operations.  This review has commenced and will be completed expeditiously.  The Revenue Commissioners also operate Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with licensed aerodromes in the state.  These MOUs provide for mutual cooperation between the operators and Customs in the fight against smuggling of prohibited drugs and fiscal products both into and out of the State.  Revenue&rsquo;s assessment of the risks of drugs smuggling through airports &ndash; and the deployment of Customs staff to meet those risks &ndash; is kept continuously under review.  I am also conscious of our obligations to our EU partners in the fight against drug trafficking and this is reflected in the action points contained in the supply reduction pillar of our own National Drugs Strategy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>Many State Services now have Customer Service Charters and Internal Appeal mechanisms available and these should operate both to reduce the need for recourse to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office and, where a complaint is nevertheless made to that Office, to ensure a prompt reply to it. In the case of the civil service, my Department introduced a Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour in September 2004 which sets out the principles that should govern the behaviour of civil servants and the standards and values that the Civil Service wishes to espouse. The Code now forms part of civil servants&rsquo; terms and conditions of service. The code builds on the principles set out in &ldquo;The Ombudsman&rsquo;s Guide to Standards of Best Practice for Public Servants&rdquo;.  It includes requirements that civil servants must maintain high standards in service delivery by conscientiously, honestly and impartially serving the Government of the day, the other institutions of the State and the public, by performing their duties with efficiency, diligence and courtesy and that they must observe appropriate behaviour at work by dealing with the public sympathetically, fairly and promptly.  A copy of the Code is available on my Department&rsquo;s Personnel Code web-site at <i>www.codpearsanra.gov.ie</i>.  As regards delays I would add that, if the Ombudsman encounters delay in the investigation of a complaint in a public body, I understand her officials raise the matter direct with the body concerned, and it is a matter for that body to respond appropriately. No instance of undue delay by my Department in responding to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office has been brought to my attention.</P>

        <Quest> if there is a capital gains tax or capital acquisitions tax liability for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the <Col N="506"/>transfer of the farm by the farmer to his son is a disposal by the farmer for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes. As the parties are related the consideration is deemed to be the market value of the farm at the time of transfer. The chargeable gain is the difference between the deemed consideration, net after the costs of transfer, and the costs of acquiring the farm after adjustment for inflation. The first &euro;1,270 of an individual&rsquo;s annual gains are exempt. The balance is chargeable to CGT at the prevailing rate, currently 20%.</P>
        <P>By way of general information relief from CGT is available where an individual, aged 55 years or over, disposes of certain business assets. These include land which has been leased under the 1992 or the 2000 EU &ldquo;Early Retirement from Farming&rdquo; Schemes, where the land was, for a period of 10 years or more immediately prior to it being leased, owned by the individual and used by him or her for the purposes of farming throughout that period. Full relief is available where the disposal is to a child although the relief is clawed back (and charged on the child) if the land is sold within six years of the transfer.  The Deputy should contact the Revenue Commissioners if he would like further information on the availability of the relief in this case.</P>
        <P>I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for the purpose of both Gift and Inheritance Tax (Capital Acquisitions Tax), the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold- known as the &ldquo;Group Threshold&rdquo;. The indexed Group threshold applying to a gift or inheritance received by a child from his/her parents is the Group A threshold and for 2006 this is &euro;478,155. Any other gifts/inheritances that might have been received by the beneficiary from within the same Group A threshold (ie from parents) since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account when applying the threshold for the purposes of calculating the gift/inheritance tax.   The transfer of a farm valued at &euro;168,000 from a father to a son is below the Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;478,155 for gifts/inheritances taken by a child from parents and, assuming the son has received no other gifts/inheritances from parents since 5 December 1991 which, when aggregated with the current gift, would exceed &euro;478,155, no Capital Acquisitions Tax will arise on the gift of the farm by the father to his son.</P>

	<P>The Disabled Drivers and the Disabled Passengers [Tax Concessions] Regulations, 1994, provides, subject to certain limits, VRT and VAT relief on the purchase of a car, relief from excise duty on fuel and exemption from motor road tax. Based on data available from the Revenue Commissioners the Table sets out information for each of the past five years in relation to the cost of the Scheme for VRT, VAT and relief from excise duty on fuel.  It also provides the number of claims for VRT relief on the purchase of a vehicle in each year.</P>

The claim for tax exemption is made in this return.  An individual must &rsquo;elect&rsquo; to claim the exemption by notice in writing to the inspector on or before the specified return date for the chargeable period.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the application of VAT to goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Passenger transport is exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive. This means that taxis cannot charge VAT on the services they supply and cannot recover VAT on the goods and services that they purchase. Essentially, only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. VAT Refund Orders have in the past been used in a limited way to provide refunds of VAT on certain aids and appliances for the disabled and on medical equipment donated voluntarily to hospitals. However, under EU law, it is no longer possible to introduce new schemes to refund VAT on the purchase of goods or services by non VAT registered persons.</P>
        <P>In relation to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT), I have no plans to reduce or eliminate VRT on taxis.  In this regard, it should be recognised that tax reliefs have proved at times to be a blunt, inflexible and expensive means of providing assistance and achieving policy aims which might be more effectively achieved through regulatory or direct expenditure means. VRT on vehicles helps to broaden the tax base and provides an important source of Exchequer revenue. I am asked regularly to introduce tax reliefs for one purpose or another, but to accede to all such requests would lead to an immediate narrowing of the tax base.</P>
        <P>My Department has been in contact with the Taxi Regulator and has advised him that there are no plans to reduce or eliminate VRT on taxis. The Taxi Regulator was also advised in that context that if he considered that some form of State <Col N="511"/>assistance was required to facilitate the greater availability and use of taxi and hackney car services for people with disability, he might in the first instance contact his parent Department to allow it to evaluate the matter and any appropriate measures within an overall policy context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has brought in a number of measures, both on the supply side and the demand side, to deal with the growing demand for childcare, which has been created by the economic and social changes which have taken place over the last decade.  These measures are aimed at supporting all parents with the cost of childcare and increasing the supply of quality childcare places.</P>
        <P>The primary supply side measure of the Government&rsquo;s approach to ensuring the provision of affordable childcare has been to stimulate the provision of quality childcare places, through the provision of grants for the childcare sector.  This is being done through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000-2006 and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006-2010.  These programmes, with a combined budget of almost &euro;1.1 billion, are projected to create over 90,000 childcare places, with some 31,750 of the new places already in place.  These places are provided either through community based/not for profit childcare groups or by private providers.  Of the total funding committed in the period from the start of the EOCP to August 2006, over &euro;484 million has been allocated to childcare facilities, of which almost &euro;183 million has been allocated to staffing grant assistance. This provides support towards the staffing costs of employing childcare workers in community based childcare centres in disadvantaged <Col N="512"/>areas, ensuring that less advantaged parents in those areas have increased access to quality childcare and that they are charged fees which are less than the economic cost of providing the service. A further &euro;67 million has been allocated to quality improvement in the childcare sector.</P>
        <P>On the demand side, Government policy to support parents with the cost of childcare has been to increase Child Benefit payments and introduce the Early Childcare Supplement (ECS).  Both instruments support all parents irrespective of income or employment status. Child Benefit has been increased in successive budgets and in Budget 2006, it was increased by &euro;8.40 per month for the first two children to &euro;150 per month; and by &euro;7.70 per month for the third and subsequent children to &euro;185 per month.  This means that over the period since 1997, Child Benefit has more than quadrupled.</P>
        <P>The ECS of &euro;1,000 per annum was introduced for all children less than 6 years of age and became effective in April 2006.  This is a direct, non-taxable payment of &euro;250 per quarter year, in respect of each eligible child.  There have already been two payments of the ECS in August and October and the final payment of &euro;250 will be paid on 11th December.  From 2007 the payments will be made in April, July, October and December. Taken together, these two payments give a family with 2 children under the age of 6 years a total of &euro;5,600 per annum.</P>
        <P>The levels of increase in Child Benefit and the introduction of the ECS is unprecedented and delivers on the Government&rsquo;s objective of providing support for children generally while offering real choice to all parents in relation to the care of their children.  I am satisfied that the EOCP and NCIP will serve to moderate prices in the sector over time by increasing the supply of places and giving parents greater choice.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s record in providing enhanced childcare supports is without parallel and I am confident that we are moving rapidly to ensure that there are quality services available to parents throughout the country.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993  provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds.  General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993, as amended by the 2005 Regulations.</P>
        <P>There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum and these rates apply in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted.  The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004.  The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on nursing home fees for example.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006. The additional &euro;20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to subventions support throughout the country. The Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. In addition, national <Col N="515"/>guidelines on nursing home subvention are currently being developed by the HSE to ensure an even and equitable application of the regulations nationally.</P>
        <P>The Government is currently considering new policy on Long Term Care and several principles underlying this were agreed with the social partners in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;. These principles include, for example, that there should be one standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised.  Sheltered housing options will be encouraged.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility. The financial model to support any new arrangements must also be financially sustainable.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently drawing up proposals for the Government&rsquo;s consideration based on the principles in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Dr. Deirdre Madden, a distinguished expert on medical law, was appointed by Government in May 2005 to provide a report on key issues relating to post-mortem practice and procedures and her report on Post-Mortem Practice and Procedures was published on 18 January this year.  Considerable progress has already been made by the HSE in implementing the recommendations of the Madden Report in hospitals across the country and my officials will continue to liaise with the Executive to monitor progress in this regard.</P>
        <P>A key recommendation of the report was that a Working Group be established to examine issues not included in the original terms of reference, that is post-mortem issues relating to babies who died before or during birth, minors and adults. This Group, chaired by Dr Madden, was set up in March, 2006 and its membership included representatives of Parents For Justice, Irish Stillbirth and Neo-natal Death Society, together with healthcare professionals from a range of disciplines across the Health Service Executive (HSE).  I received the Report from the Working Group this week (6 November) and it is available for download from the Department of Health and Children website: <i>www.dohc.ie</i>.</P><Col N="516"/>
        <P>Dr Madden&rsquo;s first report on paediatric post-mortem issues was a comprehensive and robust one and the Working Group Report dealing with post-mortem practice and procedures in other areas is equally so.  The Working Group endorsed the recommendations made in the Madden Report, in particular the need for legislation to be introduced as soon as possible to ensure that no post-mortem examination will be carried out and no tissue or organ retained from a post-mortem examination for any purpose without appropriate authorisation.</P>
        <P>Now that the recommendations are complete in respect of all age cohorts, I intend to prepare proposals for consideration by Government in relation to the legislation required to give legal effect to these recommendations.</P>

	<P>The management of out-patient waiting lists is a matter for the HSE/National Hospitals Office and the individual hospitals concerned.   However, in 2005, I asked the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to examine the position with a view to further assessing the needs of patients waiting longest on out-patient waiting lists and the most appropriate clinical pathways and protocols required for their care.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the NTPF set up a number of out-patient pilot projects around the country.  This pilot programme operated successfully and met its targets during 2005.  Although a new initiative, where hospitals engaged with the NTPF, the experience was very positive in relation to out-patient waiting times.</P>
        <P>In 2006, a further 6,000 patients have benefited from the out-patient pilot programme, bringing the total number of patients seen to 10,000.  Also during 2006, the NTPF added new specialties, including Rheumatology, to the out-patient pilot programme.  Rheumatology is being piloted in the west where up to 500 patients are scheduled to be seen by a Rheumatologist.</P>
        <P>As I have mentioned already, the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery <Col N="520"/>of health services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however, in practice, arrangements are already in place to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card <Col N="521"/>holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</P>
        <P>I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.   My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service. This process has been under way for some time and considerable progress has been made.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</P>

	<P>The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella and, in accordance with the recommendations of the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, can be administered to children between 12-15 months of age.  A vaccine uptake rate of 95% is required in order to protect children from the diseases concerned and to stop the spread of the diseases in the community.  Measles, in particular, is a highly infectious and serious disease; approximately 1 in 15 children who contract measles suffer serious complications.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, uptake of the first dose of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine (MMR1) is calculated on a quarterly basis among children of 24 months of age.  The quarterly reports on national vaccine uptake are collated by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre in accordance with international standards.  These reports include the percentage of children reaching 24 months of age who have received measles mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR)    The uptake rate for MMR at 24 months has increased from a low of 69% in 2001 to 84% in 3rd quarter 2005.  This figure increased to 88% for 4th quarter 2005 &mdash; however this did not include figures from HSE Eastern region due to technical  problems. The figure for MMR uptake 1st quarter 2006 was 86% which includes an estimate for HSE Eastern region (82%) and is a more accurate figure. MMR uptake rates vary from 82% HSE Eastern region to  95% HSE Midlands.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the unsatisfactory MMR immunisation uptake rates because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned.  The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in approximately 2,000 cases and 3 deaths, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake. However, I am encouraged by the fact that the immunisation uptake rates are improving.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that the HSE is taking the  following actions to address the deficit between the actual and the target vaccination uptake rate: the HSE will collate uptake rates by Local Health Offices to allow targeted interventions in areas of low uptake; updated immunisation booklets containing information on all childhood vaccines will be printed for distribution to all parents; information relating to all aspects of immunisation will be updated regularly on the HSE immunisation website <i>www.immunisation.ie</i>; research is under way in HSE Eastern region to ask parents why children are not vaccinated; a <Col N="523"/>National Immunisation registry  is planned which will allow more accurate and timely collation of vaccine uptake; and the HSE has proposed to put in place a Measles Eradication Plan beginning in 2007 to meet the WHO target of eliminating Measles worldwide by 2010 to which Ireland is a signatory.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

	<P>The Warmer Homes Scheme, which is part of Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s Low Income Housing Programme, aims to improve the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of homes occupied by low-income households.  The scheme provides funding to community-based organisations for the installation of energy efficiency measures including attic insulation (in some areas, and where technically appropriate), in homes in their respective localities.  The scheme is intended to benefit those who need it most and the eligibility criteria varies from region to region, depending on the target group of the community organisation in question.</P>
        <P>There are 15 community based organisations that area approved for funding to complete homes in 2006. The service available in Dublin, Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Westmeath, Roscommon, Cork, Kerry, Wexford, Cavan, Limerick and Leitrim.  The cost of increasing the number of homes from 2,000 to 10,000 homes per year would be a combination of continuing the current funding to community based organisations and to build capacity by engaging building contractors.  The current Low Income Programme Budget is &euro;1.7 million. The cost of increasing the number of homes to 10,000 per annum is &euro;8.45 million.</P>

        <P>In April 2005 a team of advisors was engaged to examine the potential for enhancing and augmenting existing state owned infrastructure. This team submitted a Feasibility Report in December 2005. The report found that, while technically feasible, there would be considerable financial, legal, regulators, operational and organisational challenges in harnessing and enhancing the existing state owned infrastructures. It is not my intention to publish the report to the extent of the commercially sensitive information contained in it.</P>
        <P>As regards the deployment of broadband infrastructure, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband.  My Department manages a number of interventions to incentivise broadband deployment nationwide.</P>
        <P>The Regional Broadband Programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.</P>
        <P>Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity. The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Group Broadband Scheme, which offered funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities. To date, 162 projects have been approved for funding.  The most recent phase of the scheme is now closed and the question of a further round of financial assistance for the provision of broadband in rural areas is currently under consideration.</P>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the three year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April, 2000). Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and people with disabilities may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</P>
<P>I am informed that the primary purpose of the Rural Social Scheme, under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is to provide income support to low-income farmers and fishermen and providing certain services of benefit to local communities.  The aim of CE remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  The schemes are quite different in their objectives.</P>

The site inspections focused primarily on roadwork activities, whereas the meetings with the senior managers within Local Authorities focused on their safety management systems and policies for all construction related activities.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority prepared a report on the campaign detailing the findings and recommendations which was circulated to all Local Authorities.  Subsequently, in 2006, the Health and Safety Authority has held Seminars for City and County Managers and are supporting the Local Authorities.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Authority that following on from the campaign the County and City Managers, supported by the Local Government Management Services Board, have made strong commitments to ensure that a robust health and safety management system is put in place and are working with the Health and Safety Authority to this end.  The Authority, through its 2006 Programme of Work has identified construction/civil engineering work as being an area of activity which needed to be prioritised, due to the high risk of injury associated with the activity. In that context, Local Authorities, being duty holders under the Construction Regulations, are required to comply with the provisions of legislation, in particular the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Construction Regulations 2001, replaced since 6 November 2006 by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P>The Authority&rsquo;s inspectors have been endeavouring to promote the putting in place by employers of a management system for occupational health and safety which would ensure that adequate plans are in place for such construction activities.  Inspectors use their enforcement powers under the legislation as necessary and have taken a particular interest in unfinished projects which have left signage, temporary surfaces etc. in place for lengthy periods.</P>
        <P>The Authority is of the view that all projects should conform to the law and that as Local Authorities are to the forefront in terms of the scale and complexity of their projects there is a particular onus on them to conform.  In any event, the adoption of good occupational safety health management systems make good financial sense, and also the adoption of control measures to protect workers makes for good overall management.  In some cases delays may be arising while safety management systems are being put in place, but as safety is paramount, the benefits of a good system will offset any inconvenience and cost of delays especially where these benefits result in the prevention of injury and loss of life.</P>

<P>To qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme an applicant must, <i>inter alia</i>, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 6 months for a second level course or 12 months for a third level course.  This is reduced to 9 months where the applicant is participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and the third level course is approved by a F&Aacute;S Services Officer as part of that process.  This condition must be satisfied immediately prior to commencing the first year of the course of education being pursued.  The person concerned had already completed the first year of a course of education when she applied for participation in the BTEA scheme and is not, therefore, eligible for the allowance.</P>

In line with the provisions of the Disability Act, specific commitments in relation to human resources and employment practices for staff with disabilities were included in my Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan which was published in July 2006.

	<P>Access to transport is an important issue for people with disabilities in participating more fully in society in general as well as facilitating access to employment opportunities. My Department does not provide direct assistance towards private taxi travel but administers the Free Travel scheme allowing eligible persons, including certain people with disabilities, to use public transport and a large number of private bus and ferry services free of charge. In this regard, I have recently lifted the restrictions which had applied to peak time travel for holders of Free Travel passes so there is now no limit placed on the amount of free travel eligible people may take.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive, currently administers the Mobility Allowance, which provides financial assistance to eligible people who are unable to walk or use public transport. This allowance is paid at a rate of &euro;173 per month unless the person is also availing of the Disabled Drivers and Passengers scheme which provides tax relief linked to the purchase and use of vehicles, in which case it is paid at the lower rate of &euro;86.50 per month.</P>
        <P>In line with a recent Government decision, the Mobility Allowance, together with other income maintenance functions currently administered by the Health Services Executive, will be transferred to my Department and an inter-departmental group has been established to oversee this transfer. This will provide an opportunity to examine schemes which provide financial assistance towards transport in a more integrated way and to identify the scope for further improvements, as resources permit.</P>

	<P>I would not accept the view that the National Drug Strategy is failing.  Indeed, the main finding of the mid-term review of the Strategy was that the current aims and objectives were fundamentally sound and that progress was <Col N="540"/>being made across all pillars of the Strategy.  It would seem from newspaper reports that the Chief Executive of Merchants Quay Ireland, speaking at the launch of his organisation&rsquo;s 2005 report, deduced from the heavy demand on the services provided by them that there is a lack of development of local drugs services and an increased need for local needle exchange programmes.  He also noted that changing trends and patterns in drug use, specifically relating to cocaine, have impacted on their services.</P>
        <P>With respect to local drug services, these have been developed in all Local Drug Task Force areas and are being developed throughout the country.  At the end of September 2006, the Central Treatment List indicated that 7,966 people with heroin problems were in receipt of methadone treatment and that the waiting list for treatment services was 156.  This latter figure represents a drop of 36% on the number recorded in September 2005.  With respect to needle exchanges, an allocation of &euro;3m was made by the Department of Health &amp; Children in 2006 for the further development of Harm Reduction Services.  I am informed by the HSE that needle exchange services are provided at a local level in each of the former Eastern Health Board areas and are currently being developed in other areas where there is likely to be a demand.  With regard to the emerging trend of cocaine misuse, a joint briefing paper that I requested from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the National Drug Strategy Team was received in September. I am currently awaiting responses from the relevant Agencies and Departments as to how the recommendations of the briefing paper might be addressed.</P>
        <P>I believe that there are encouraging signs of progress over the past couple of years &mdash; be it in the areas of drug seizures, expansion of treatment services, establishment of the Regional Drugs Task Forces, prevention programmes in schools and the very encouraging results of the Research Outcome Study in Ireland (ROSIE), which evaluated heroin treatment effectiveness. I am confident that the momentum built up around the various initiatives in the National Drugs Strategy will see them implemented within the appointed timescale, which runs to the end of 2008.</P>

	<P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform takes the lead <Col N="541"/>role in the matter of the integration of new ethnic groups into Irish society.  However, Ethnic Minorities are identified as a target group under the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) which is delivered locally on behalf of my Department by area partnership companies, community partnership companies and local employment pacts.  Integrating Ireland and the <Col N="542"/>Irish Refugee Council are being supported under my Department&rsquo;s Federations and Networks Scheme and Anti-Poverty Networks Scheme.  In addition a number of projects supporting immigrant families funded under the Dormant Accounts Fund have bee approved, totalling almost &euro;550,000. Details are given in the appendix to this reply.</P><Col N="541"/>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the new measures he proposes to introduce to respond to the drug situation, in view of the new data on fatal drug overdoses, particularly involving cocaine, and the growing concern among communities. </Quest>
        <QRef>[37290/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There are inherent dangers in drug use, including the use of cocaine.  In particular the consumption of cocaine with alcohol, which is converted in the body to cocaethylene and which is more toxic than either drug consumed separately, can be extremely hazardous.  I believe that there are encouraging signs of progress over the past couple of years &mdash; be it in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion of treatment services, the establishment of the Regional Drugs Task Forces, the prevention programmes in schools and the very encouraging results of the Research Outcome Study in Ireland (ROSIE) which evaluated heroin treatment effectiveness.</P>
        <P>While I am confident that, through the implementation of the actions in the National Drugs Strategy and the projects and initiatives operated through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces, the problem of cocaine use can be and is being addressed, I also recognised the need for an overview of the emerging threat from cocaine.  To this end, I asked the National Advisory Com<Col N="542"/>mittee on Drugs and the National Drug Strategy Team to prepare a joint briefing paper on the current situation with regards to cocaine use. I received this report in September and it contains a number of recommendations to tackle the growth in the use of cocaine.  My Department has written to the relevant Departments and agencies regarding the recommendations of the report and they are awaiting responses in this regard.  It is envisaged that the matter will be followed up further at the December meeting of the Inter-departmental Group on Drugs.  There is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available.  In this context, the Health Service Executive has recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in the last number of years.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Drugs Task Forces, each one has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in their area based on their own identified priorities and they continue to have ongoing contact with their local communities. Six projects in LDTF areas specifically aimed at cocaine have been allocated funding of &euro;421,285 under the Emerging Needs Fund. Five of the projects focus on the provision of direct community based services for cocaine users located within existing services and the sixth is supporting the development of an information booklet.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I launched the four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use, as well as a training initiative focusing on frontline workers.  Funding <Col N="543"/>of almost &euro;400,000 was provided by me to support these initiatives.</P>
        <P>The four projects deal with the following cohorts of cocaine users:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />intravenous cocaine users;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />poly-drug users using cocaine; &middot;	problematic intranasal cocaine users; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />problematic female cocaine users.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While these projects are at varying stages of progress, preliminary evaluation reports will be available on most of them shortly.  It is hoped that the results of these evaluations will aid the formulation of effective actions aimed at tackling cocaine misuse.  I might also point out that all primary and second level schools now have substance misuse prevention programmes. In addition, the National Drugs Awareness Campaign focused one of their campaigns specifically on cocaine use.</P>
        <P>The problems associated with cocaine use have not been underestimated.  In particular I am determined that we will continue to work to get the message across that cocaine is a dangerous drug and that its use directly contributes to the illegal drugs industry and the crime and violence associated with it. Overall, I believe that progress is being made and I will continue to respond in a flexible and focused way as the situation evolves.</P>

	<P>The main infrastructural programme operated by my Department is the CL&Aacute;R Programme.  It is a targeted investment programme for rural areas and now covers parts of 22 counties and all of Co. Leitrim.  The Programme supports a wide variety of local and community infrastructural developments such as village/housing/schools enhancement, electricity conversion, roads, water supply, sewerage disposal, health, coastal, sports and community projects.  I believe that the Programme is a very <Col N="544"/>important element of the various rural development initiatives operated by my Department and it is having a major impact on the lives of people living in the CL&Aacute;R areas.  The Programme ensures that small community and rural infrastructural projects are being supported &mdash; many of which might otherwise not be funded.  Funding of &euro;22.95m is available for the Programme in 2006.</P>

	<P>Decisions on the disbursements of funds from dormant accounts under the initial round of funding were a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts.  Under this round, the Board received 1,649 applications and approved 521 projects for funding totalling over &euro;60 million.  The Board engaged Pobal (formerly Area Development Management Limited &mdash; ADM) as a service provider to administer the funding programme on its behalf.  To date over &euro;26 million has been transferred directly from the Fund to Pobal in respect of these approved projects.  It is anticipated that the balance (&euro;34 million) will be disbursed during the remainder of 2006 and beyond.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, decisions on disbursements are made by Government following a transparent process.  In accordance with the legislation, the Government approved the allocation of &euro;60 million in 2006 for the following purposes:</P>
          <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;24 million to support projects tackling economic and social disadvantage;</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;18 million towards projects tackling educational disadvantage; and</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;18 million towards projects assisting persons with a disability.</P>
        <P FLI="0">To date in 2006, under the Economic and Social Disadvantage category, the Government has approved funding in excess of &euro;13.4 million in support of 220 projects as shown in the table.</P><Col N="543"/>

	<P>Since the establishment of Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) in 1997 over &euro;122m has been allocated to the 14 LDTFs to implement action plans for their areas.  This figure includes monies allocated to some LDTF projects before they were mainstreamed to other Departments and Agencies who now fund them.  It also includes capital allocations under the Premises Initiative totalling &euro;14m and Emerging Needs Fund allocations of &euro;4m.</P>
        <P>I made an allocation of &euro;5m in 2006 to the ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) to commence implementation of their action plans.  The RDTFs cover all parts of the country not included under the 14 LDTFs.  It is envisaged that funding will be increased incrementally to achieve the full roll out of the RDTF plans, currently estimated to cost &euro;12.2m on an annual basis.  The Premises Initiative has also been extended to include the RDTF areas.</P>

The case mentioned by the Deputy is one of approximately 120 further applications that will be considered for approval shortly. Where an application is approved, payment will issue promptly.  A further 80 applications approximately are in earlier stages of processing; in some cases additional information is awaited from the community groups to assist completion of their applications.</P>
        <P>I should point out that as a result of important changes I introduced to the Scheme this year, applications from community groups can now be submitted at any time during the year.

        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the expenditure by his Department under the RAPID programme in the past five years; if the funding is derived from the dormant accounts fund, the national lottery or other sources; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report progress with their projects under the RAPID programme.  In support of my Department, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal&rsquo;s website under the RAPID section (<i>http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID</i>). The Deputy may find it helpful to access this information. I understand that full data in respect of the year 2006 will not be collected until early 2007.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I launched the RAPID Leverage Fund in 2004 to support small-scale projects identified by the Area Implementation Schemes.  The Exchequer provides the funding for these schemes.  The following are the schemes, the allocations and the draw down to date under these schemes:</P>
        <P LI="1">Local Authority Housing Estate Enhancement Scheme 2004, Allocation &euro;1.15m, draw down to date &euro;1.10m;</P>
        <P LI="1">Local Authority Housing Estate Enhancement Scheme 2005/06, Allocation &euro;2.03m, draw down to date &euro;0.75m;</P>
        <P LI="1">Playground 2004, Allocation &euro;3.00m, draw down to date &euro;2.75m;</P>
        <P LI="1">Playground 2005, Allocation &euro;2.97m, draw down to date &euro;1.00m;</P>
        <P LI="1">Traffic Measures 2005, Allocation &euro;1.01m, draw down to date &euro;0.63m;</P>
        <P LI="1">Health Sector Co-Fund, Allocation &euro;2.30m, draw down to date &euro;0.50m;</P>
        <P LI="1">Sports Capital 2004, Allocation &euro;2.20m, draw down to date &euro;0.94m;</P>
        <P LI="1">Sports Capital 2005, Allocation &euro;2.30m, draw down to date &euro;0.31m.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund are made within the overall framework of the Disbursement Plan provided for in the legislation.  Under the initial round of funding, the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board approved 521 projects for funding totalling over &euro;60 million.  Consistent with the direction given by <Col N="549"/>Government when approving the Disbursement Plan, approximately &euro;32 million of these approvals were in respect of projects based within RAPID areas.  Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, further funding amounting to &euro;11.35 million was ring-fenced to support 188 priority projects in RAPID areas under the 2006 round of funding.</P>
        <P>My Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTF) and 10 Regional Drugs Task Forces.  The LDTFs were established in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin, and many of them have RAPID areas within them.  Over &euro;150m has been allocated to the Task Forces to implement two rounds of local action plans.  A further &euro;14.36m has been allocated to capital projects under the LDTF Premises Initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects.</P>
        <P>Approximately &euro;107 million has been allocated to-date to support the work of the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund in LDTF areas and four other urban centres.  The main aim of the <Col N="550"/>Fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.  It is not possible to quantify the exact spend in RAPID areas.</P>

	<P>Since 1997, across the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas, over 440 community-based projects have been established with funding in the region of &euro;122m provided.  These projects, some of which have been mainstreamed to other Departments and Agencies in the interim, employ more than 300 people.  In the current year, 361 projects, including those under the Emerging Needs Fund, are receiving interim funding totalling &euro;20.2m from my Department.  Of these, 174 projects deal with the issues of treatment and rehabilitation.  I allocated &euro;5m in 2006 to the ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) to facilitate the commencement of the implementation of their action plans.  The National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST) has been working closely with the RDTFs to get their programmes up and running as speedily as possible.  A total of 59 projects proposed by the RDTFs deal with treatment and rehabilitation and are currently at various stages of development.</P>
        <P>Projects normally originate at Drugs Task Force level and are submitted to the National Drugs Strategy Team.  Following consideration by the NDST recommendations for funding of some projects are made to my Department.  No applications for funding of rehabilitation initiatives, or courses associated with rehabilitation, are currently with the Department.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) clearly reinforces the Government&rsquo;s commitments to rural development and to the revitalisation of rural areas.  As a general principle, subject to good planning practice in matters of location, siting, design and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas and areas of high landscape value, rural generated housing needs should be accommodated in the areas where they arise. The Rural Planning Guidelines are based on the premise that people who have roots in &mdash; or links to &mdash; rural areas and are part of &mdash; and contribute to &mdash; the rural community will get planning permission for houses, provided they meet the normal planning requirements.  The Guidelines, when introduced in 2005, reflected what I had been saying for a number of years in relation to this issue.  They provide a detailed framework for planners, based on the NSS&rsquo;s rural housing policy.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Government have put in place a balanced framework in relation to rural planning.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware my Department was established on 6 June 2002 to promote and support the sustainable and inclusive development of communities, both urban and rural, thereby fostering better regional balance and alleviating disadvantage.</P>
        <P>My Department has responsibility for a wide range of programmes covering community and local development, drugs, volunteering, Gaeltacht, Irish language and rural development.   Many of these measures, individually and collectively, focus on communities, particularly those that are vulnerable or under threat.  Those communities may be in rural or inner city settings, grappling with difficulties caused by a range of factors, including declining populations, unemployment, language issues, social disadvantage or drug misuse.  As well as communities that can be defined in terms of geographic location, the Department also supports communities that are defined on the basis of a common focus on a particular issue.  My Department operates a number of National schemes such as the Community Services Programme, Local Development Programme, Dormant Accounts Fund and Community Development Programme which provide significant resources to both urban and rural communities.</P>
        <P>The Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) provides a series of Measures, funded under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, that are designed to tackle social exclusion, deliver a more sustainable economy, improve employment prospects and balance regional development. These Measures are particularly targeted at the areas of greatest need throughout the country.  The LDSIP aims to empower communities in these areas to tackle disadvantage and to have a fresh start.</P>
        <P>The LDSIP seeks to improve the quality of life for all members of our communities but specifically targets the following Groups:</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The long-term unemployed</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Disadvantaged women</P><Col N="561"/>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Disadvantaged young people</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Travellers</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Disabled People </P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Older people</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Homeless people</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Ex-prisoners</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Low-income farm Households</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Ethnic Minorities</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Substance Mis-users</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Lone Parents</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The underemployed</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Young people at risk</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Disadvantaged communities living in isolated rural areas or deprived urban areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Pobal administers the LDSIP on behalf of my Department. The LDSIP is delivered by 38 Partnerships, 31 Community Partnerships and 2 Employment Pacts, which are not-for-profit private companies focusing on combating disadvantage and social exclusion in their areas.  It is intended to extend the scope of the LDSIP to provide full national coverage under the programme for 2007. Further developments in relation to the programme are dependent on the finalisation of the next NDP.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Community Services Programme, the Partnership Agreement, &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; commits the government to providing an additional &euro;30m over the next three years to the CSP. This will increase the annual budget from &euro;42m to &euro;72m by 2009. Applications for extra funding in 2006/7 have been assessed and 125 successful projects have been notified.</P>
        <P>Funding is available directly from my Department for RAPID areas under the RAPID Leverage schemes, which I introduced in 2004.  These schemes cover Local Authority Housing Estate Enhancement, provision of Playgrounds, improved Traffic Measures, locally based Health projects, Justice projects (including Community Based CCTV) and Sports Capital Programme Top Up.  I have already announced schemes in all these areas to cover 2006, 2007 and indeed some schemes extend into 2008.  I am constantly reviewing the needs and views of the RAPID areas and communities and will consider expanding the remit of the current schemes when and if the need arises.</P>
        <P>The Community Development Programme was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling the causes and effects of poverty and disadvantage.  The Programme is designed to reduce social exclusion by targeting support at disadvantaged and socially excluded communities in order to improve their capacity to benefit from social and economic development.  The Programme is not a <Col N="562"/>grant scheme as projects are funded on a contract basis, and only projects within the Programme are funded.  182 projects, located in recognised disadvantaged urban and rural areas nationwide, are currently supported under the Programme. In keeping with the bottom-up ethos of the Programme, volunteers drawn from the local community manage these projects. Typically, a project will be core-funded to support two staff members and the cost of administration and overheads of a resource premises. Once-off grants are also available, covering minor maintenance of premises, purchase of office equipment and selected programme activities.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;24 million has been allocated to the Programme in 2006. This will bring funding to approximately &euro;148m under the Programme through the current National Development Plan since the foundation of the Department in 2002.  Funded projects are expected to:</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />have an anti-poverty focus and promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and exclusion at all levels of the project</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />act as a resource within the communities of which they are a part</P>
          <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />be managed by local voluntary management committees made up predominantly of people from the local area/target groups who themselves have experience of disadvantage and social exclusion</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />promote co-ordination and co-operation between community, voluntary and statutory groups in their areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Reports from the Projects indicate that some 30,000 people use the services and resources of their local CDP on an annual basis with 15,000 of these participating in CDP based training and education courses. CDPs also provide resources/facilities for over 700 local community organisations. These include groups representing lone parents, people with disabilities, the elderly, youth groups, childcare groups and other miscellaneous groups working with disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>The Community Development Programme 2000-2006 expires at the end of December 2006 in line with the current National Development Plan (NDP) and all such programmes.  My Department is currently framing a successor programme to support Community Development Projects under a new NDP to cover the period 2007 to 2013.  The development of a new programme must ensure that actions undertaken by Projects and funded by the Exchequer should be fully consistent with the strategic framework agreed for the NDP. The new partnership agreement, Towards 2016; the recent National Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion (NSSPI), submitted to the EU in September of this year; the forthcoming National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAP inclusion); <Col N="563"/>and the NDP (2007-2013) will provide an extensive strategic framework to create more coherent and integrated structures.</P>
        <P>Disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund are for the purpose of assisting three broad categories of persons &mdash; those who are economically or socially disadvantaged; those who are educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability.  In accordance with the Dormant Accounts Board&rsquo;s Disbursement Plan, allocations from the Fund are targeted in particular at those areas designated as most disadvantaged (i.e.  RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and Local Drugs Task Force areas).  In this regard, &euro;11.35 million was approved in July 2006 to support 188 priority projects in RAPID areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>While the organic sector in Ireland is small by European standards, it is growing.  The total area in conversion or with full organic status rose by nearly 5,000 hectares to over 35,000 hectares in 2005, an increase of some 15% on 2004.  That figure has increased by a further 1,500 hectares so far this year.</P>
        <P>My Department already provides substantial financial supports for organic producers, through the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Scheme of Grant Aid for the development of the organic sector.  Since REPS began in 1994, it has delivered some &euro;37 million to the sector.  The new Rural Development Programme for the period 2007-2013 will build on the success of REPS by including measures designed <Col N="567"/>particularly to encourage development in the organic tillage and horticulture areas.  It is proposed, for example, to allow organic farmers to obtain organic support payments without having to be in the REP Scheme.</P>
        <P>Lack of technical expertise has been recognised as a barrier to progress in both the organic tillage and horticultural areas.  To address this information deficit, my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, arranged this year to bring in two specialist agronomists, on a pilot basis, from the UK.  Through farm visits and workshops, they shared their experiences with producers and this has been of immense value.</P>
        <P>Another successful initiative has been the demonstration farm programme.  It continued during 2006 and a total of 13 farms were used throughout the country to promote organic farming systems.  My Department will continue to expand and improve this programme which is a major instrument in encouraging conventional growers to switch to organic.</P>
        <P>Substantial progress has also been made on the implementation of the recommendations in the Organic Development Committee report, published in 2002.  The three additional structures recommended are now into their second three-year terms.  The National Steering Group advises me on all policy issues relating to the sector.  The Steering Group is supported by two sub-Groups, the Partnership Expert Working Group and the Organic Market Development Group.  The Partnership Expert Working Group is responsible for training, education, advice and research.  The Organic Market Development Group has overall responsibility for developing a national marketing strategy for organic food.</P>
        <P>The development at production level cannot happen in isolation.  It needs a market to support it.  The most recent initiative in this regard is the three-year Organic Marketing Plan, produced by Bord Bia in consultation with the Organic Market Development Group.  The objective of the plan, for which my Department has allocated funding, is to develop the organic sector in Ireland for existing suppliers and new entrants.</P>

	<P>EU Directive 64/432/EEC provides that, where an animal reacts positively to a TB <Col N="568"/>test, two clear reactor re-tests at 2 month intervals are required before the Officially TB-free status of the holding can be restored. The Directive does, however, provide for a derogation from the second test provided certain conditions are fulfilled. This derogation is catered for under the Department&rsquo;s singleton policy which, among other things, provides that glands removed from the reactor must not show any visible lesions following laboratory analysis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The herd in question was restricted following disclosure of an inconclusive animal on 25 May 2006.  The inconclusive animal was retested on 25 August 2006 and deemed a reactor.  On 14 September 2006, the reactor was slaughtered and the glands were sent to the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (CVRL) for histopathological examination. The remainder of the herd was tested on 16 September following the removal of the reactor animal.  This test was clear.  However, the report from the CVRL indicated that visible lesions were detected in the glands of the reactor animal. In view of this, the herd does not qualify for the singleton derogation referred to above. Accordingly, two reactor retests will be required before the herd can be derestricted.  The first reactor re-test will be completed on 10 November 2006.  The second reactor re-test will be scheduled for the first week in January 2007.  If the two tests are clear, the holding will be de-restricted and the cattle passports will be returned to the person concerned.</P>

The planner will be required to lodge with the Department by 31 March 2007 both written confirmation that such a planning application has been lodged and also a copy of the set of draw<Col N="569"/>ings which accompanied the planning application.   Farmers can, therefore, submit an application to the Department under the Scheme before any application for planning permission has been made to the relevant local authority.  Before final consideration of the application can take place, full and final planning permission, including conditions, will, of course, be received. All applications which do not require planning permission must be lodged in full by 31 December 2006.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that this additional flexibility should provide every interested farmer with an opportunity to submit an application before year-end under this most attractive grant Scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 to 212, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>On the 1 February 2006 the Minister for Health and Children and I published the report of the Fottrell Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training. Among the recommendations of the Fottrell Group was that a graduate stream of entry to medicine be introduced and that all graduates of honours Bachelor degree programmes should be eligible to apply.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the Higher Education Authority will shortly issue a competitive call for proposals to provide the new graduate entry programme, with a view to additional places being provided on this programme from 2007.</P><Col N="570"/>
        <P>It has been decided that graduate entry will be open to graduates of all disciplines. The provision of a graduate entry stream is an important development in reducing pressures on aspiring medical students who until now have effectively had one chance of entry, based on their Leaving Certificate performance. This will allow students to make a decision to enter medicine at a more mature age and should result in a more diverse range of entrants into the profession.</P>
        <P>No decisions have been made on the level of tuition fees for the graduate programme as this will form part of the overall outcome of the competitive call for proposals. The cost of the programme to the State will also be part of this process.</P>

	<P>My Department supports a multi-skills approach to the education of children with autism, where a range of teaching methods can be applied specific to the needs of individual pupils.  My Department currently has no plans to implement the Son-Rise programme on a pilot basis.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be familiar with the variety of current provision in this regard, which includes pre-school classes for children with autism, special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools, special classes for Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome plus a range of supports for pupils with autism integrated in mainstream classes.  A pilot scheme facilitated the establishment of 12 specific autism units nationwide.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 to 240, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Information in relation to classes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The reference date for the provision by schools of this information is the 30th September of the school year in question and the date for return by the schools is 31 October. Consequently, the details for the current school year (2006/2007) are not yet available.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary in recent years. There are now 4000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc..</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher <Col N="574"/>for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &ndash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>

        <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department and would take an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.</P><Col N="576"/>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 4000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc..</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &ndash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>

	<P>Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. </P>
        <P>A developing school is defined as a school where the enrolment on 30 September of one year is projected to exceed the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year by a minimum numerical increase of 25 pupils and by having an excess of 5 pupils above the required appointment figure.</P>
        <P>In the case of such schools, an additional permanent post(s) may be sanctioned provisionally pending the confirmation of the valid enrolment on 30 September of the school year in question. In the event of the appropriate enrolment figure not being achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Application(s) for an additional post(s) under developing school criteria must be submitted on or before a date in October of the school year in question. In the current school year, the date was the 10th October, 2006.</P>
        <P>The above criteria are set out in Primary Circular 0023/2006 which is available on my Department website <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department does not have a specific funding provision in respect of the operating costs of music programmes in primary schools.  However, arts education, which incorporates music, is one of the seven curriculum areas that comprise the primary curriculum, (revised in 1999).  Primary Teachers, as a result of their teacher training, are qualified to teach music and other areas of the curriculum and are paid by my Department.  </P><Col N="578"/>
        <P>Further support for the provision of music as part of the curriculum is also provided by way of the Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP).  This programme provides professional development support to teachers to assist them in implementing the curriculum.  The PCSP is engaged in a wide range of support activities, including organising seminars for teachers, visiting schools and providing tailored support for individual schools and clusters of schools. I am however aware that some schools choose to bring in specialist music teachers from outside their school to provide music tuition and may fund this practice by way of voluntary contributions from parents. Voluntary contributions in recognised primary schools are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management, however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</P>

	<P>My Department purchased a 3.8 acre site from Menolly Properties Ltd at a cost of &euro;2.45m for the school in question. The existing primary school building was provided at a cost of &euro;3.6m. The extension to the school is expected to cost &euro;4.8m.</P>
        <P>There are three schools on the site in question, Mary Mother of Hope N.S., St. Benedict&rsquo;s NS and Castaheany Educate Together NS. The latter two of these schools however are using the site and prefabricated accommodation on a temporary basis only and it is planned to ultimately permanently locate them on a site in Ongar. The prefab accommodation was initially provided to house Mary Mother of Hope and subsequently was used for the other two when Mary Mother got the first phase of its permanent building.</P>
        <P>The cost of providing the temporary accommodation was &euro;1.5m, of which &euro;1 million related to the purchase of prefabs.

	<P>The provision of a 1,000 student post-primary school in Donabate is a project of the highest priority for this Government. Some weeks back I gave an undertaking that as soon as the legal process for the transfer of the site to the Department&rsquo;s ownership had been agreed with Fingal County Council, the project could be moved to the next stage. That has now been agreed and I am glad to have been in a position to announce the project, among 80 others, for progress yesterday.</P>
        <P>The terms of the agreement with Fingal County Council will not only ensure enhanced facilities for the school but will also provide for community access to the school&rsquo;s sports facilities.  In relation to the timescale for the new school building, I assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the needs of the Donabate-Portrane area and I am determined to progress this project as quickly as possible.  The project will be fast-tracked and a project manager will now be appointed to initiate the procurement process for the new school.</P>
        <P>It is intended that Donabate Community College will welcome its first intake of students in September 2008. The initial group of students will be accommodated in temporary accommodation with the new building being provided as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</P>

	<P>Special need assistant (SNA) support is provided specifically to address the care needs of pupils with special educational needs. The nature and level of support provided is based on the assessed needs of the individual child having regard to the criteria set out in my Department&rsquo;s circulars.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs (SEN) supports from primary and post primary schools. The teaching and SNA support allocated are intended to enable schools to meet the needs of pupils as outlined in psychological and other professional reports. In allocating SEN supports for individual pupils, the SENOs examine the teaching and <Col N="582"/>other resources available within the individual schools.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has advised that on 27th July, 2005, the SENO allocated access to SNA support as required to the pupil in question. This support was to be provided by an SNA already in the school who was caring primarily for another pupil. A further application for SNA support was received by the SENO for another child enrolling in junior infants in the school in September, 2006. The SENO determined that the SNA allocated to the school can cater for the needs all three pupils, as required. The SENO has not received any further correspondence from the school concerning the pupil in question and SNA support has not been withdrawn.</P>

	<P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Grant Schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  The Acts make special provision for the assessment of means in the case of mature students. Under the terms of the Higher Education Grants Scheme, mature students are categorised as either independent <Col N="583"/>mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; income or address. The statutory definition of a mature student is a person of not less than 23 years of age who has reached that age on the 1st day of January in the year of entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for assistance under each of the four schemes is determined with reference to age, nationality, income, residency and previous academic attainment.  A student&rsquo;s personal circumstances, i.e. a disability, do not influence a decision on eligibility for grant assistance under the student grant schemes.  The other schemes of student support for third level students have similar provisions.</P>
        <P>Apart from the funding provided through the student maintenance grant schemes support is also available to students with disabilities through the Fund for Students with Disabilities. Grants are provided for students who have serious sensory, physical and/or communicative disabilities.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide the students in question with assistance and/or equipment to enable them to enter, partake-in and complete their course of study.</P>
        <P>Students are advised to contact the Disability Officer in their institution to discuss their particular disability and the equipment or services required.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 268 together.</P>
        <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department and would require an inordinate amount of staff time to assemble. The Deputy will appreciate that my Department provides aid to all recognised schools under a variety of headings, eg., teachers salaries, transition year support grant, secretarial and caretaking grants, supervision and substitution, capital funding etc.</P>
        <P>There are 59 fee-charging second level schools in the country; of which one is Jewish, 21 Protestant, 2 inter-denominational and the balance Catholic. These schools, with the exception of the special arrangements that apply in respect of the Protestant and Jewish schools, do not receive capitation or related supports. The Protestant and Jewish schools receive funding mainly by way of a Block grant, which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable pupils of the Protestant and Jewish persuasion to attend schools, which reflect their denominational ethos.</P>
        <P>In the case of Protestant schools, the grant is paid to the Protestant Secondary Education Committee who make grants to needier Protestant children to enable them to attend school. A similar arrangement is applied in the case of the Jewish school.  Such schools also receive funding, other than the per capita grant, towards support services such as secretarial and caretaking and miscellaneous grants. Fee charging schools not embraced by the Block grant do not qualify for payment of capitation supports.</P>
        <P>School building projects, whether for fee-charging schools or schools in the free education scheme, are selected for inclusion in the Schools&rsquo; Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need using published criteria. Considerations of State support for minority religions has been an important factor in the provision of funding for such schools, given that much of the fee-paying sector has traditionally been made up of Protestant schools and those with a minority religious ethos.</P><Col N="585"/>
        <P>The amount of capital funding given to fee-paying schools has been extremely small in recent years.  For example, in the period 1999-2004, the total amount of capital funding given to fee-paying schools represented just 1.6% of total second level capital expenditure.  Non fee charging schools are of course entitled to claim from the wide range of financial supports made available by my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 to 274, inclusive, together.</P>
<P>Details of non-pay funding, as requested by the Deputy, are set out in the table.</P>
        <P>The funding arrangements made by my Department for voluntary secondary, comprehensive &amp; community and VEC schools and colleges reflect the different management and ownership arrangements that apply to schools at second level.  Voluntary secondary schools, in the Free Education scheme, which are privately owned and managed, are funded by way of per capita grants.</P>
        <P>Community and Comprehensive schools are funded on a budget basis, that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as disadvantaged status, age of buildings, size of school etc. Financial allocations for Vocational schools and Community colleges are made to the VECs as part of a block grant which <Col N="587"/>also covers the VEC head-office overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme.</P>
        <P>At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding. All schools submit a return of pupil enrolments based on the number attending as at 30th September each year. Schools have considerable discretion as to how this funding is best utilised in the interests of pupils.</P>
        <P>In the case of VECs, the Department does not earmark funding allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of VECs. The way in which such allocations are distributed among schools is a matter for each committee in line with their priorities and perceptions of need. As VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets, the extent of information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in the funding of our second level schools in recent years and I will continue to prioritise this area. For example, the standard per capita grant for secondary schools has increased from &euro;256 per pupil in 2001 to &euro;298 per pupil from January, 2006. A new support services grant was also introduced in 2000. This amounted to some &euro;25 per pupil when it was introduced, but has increased to the point that it now amounts to &euro;159 per pupil in 2006. Budget allocations for the C&amp;C and VEC sectors also benefited on a pro rata basis with increases in the standard per capita grants.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277 and 283 together.</P>
        <P>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, which include an obligation to ensure that all out-offices, yards and forecourts within the curtilage of the building and all boundary walls, fences and railings are maintained in good repair.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 also provides that, in certain circumstances, third parties adversely affected by a landlord&rsquo;s failure to enforce the obligations of a tenant under a tenancy can make a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).</P>
        <P>I recently announced a comprehensive Action Programme to promote improvement in standards of private rented accommodation.  An important element of the Programme will be the updating of the existing standards regulations in consultation with local authorities, the (PRTB) and other relevant interests.</P>
        <P>A key objective of the Action Programme is to achieve more effective enforcement of the regulations.  Local authorities have been asked to prioritise action to improve enforcement through a planned and strategic approach and increased funding is being provided to them for this purpose.  Around &euro;1.6m was provided in 2005 and this is being increased to around &euro;2m for 2006.</P>
        <P>As part of the Action Programme, the Centre for Housing Research is also carrying out a study of measures to promote improvement in private rented accommodation standards, including good practice guidelines to assist local authorities in their functions relating to the private rented sector.</P>
        <P>In relation to noise, section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 empowers local authorities to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise.  In addition section 108 provides that, in certain circumstances, a person may take court proceedings in relation to noise.</P>

	<P>To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  This arrangement operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of this year.   This service is free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.</P>
        <P>The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites. A significant finding from the pilot scheme is that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it is necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I have recently announced that collections of waste silage / bale wrap will now be put in place by Leitrim, Roscommon, Carlow, Longford, North Tipperary and Wicklow County Councils.   Announcements regarding further extensions of collections to other areas, including Kilkenny, will follow completion of collections in those counties taking part in the second phase of the scheme and a review of this second phase of the scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  However, my Department has asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors to agree on arrangements to assist lower income households by offering alternatives to periodic lump-sum payments.</P>
        <P>In August this year, I published a consultation paper on options for future regulation of the waste sector. Submissions were invited on whether there is a need for a regulator for the sector, if so on what model of regulator might be most appropriate and on what powers any such regulator should be given. Among the possible powers discussed in the paper is the power to impose a public service obligation so that services can be provided where they would not otherwise be economically feasible. Following consideration of the submissions received, which is currently underway, I intend to finalise further policy proposals.</P>

	<P>In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register. In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register. This included:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a commitment of up to &euro;6m in new funding from the Exchequer, additional to the normal local authority spend of some &euro;7m, to ensure a comprehensive and well  resourced Register campaign;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a &euro;1m national media campaign involving TV, radio, the print media and billboards;</P><Col N="593"/>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />new IT based arrangements so that the names of people that have died are automatically notified to local authorities for deletion from the Register;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />all local authority websites to facilitate voters in checking that their names are on the register; and</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a central website www.checktheregister.ie (which went live on 1 November) giving direct links to each local authority&rsquo;s eReg enquiry screen.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My Department also worked with a group of local authority managers and senior officials to put in place an enhanced programme for improving the 2007/2008 Register.  Detailed procedures for the carrying out of registration fieldwork were finalised and issued to local authorities in early July. The procedures included provision for ensuring that each household was visited and provided with forms and information at least twice, if necessary. In the event that this process did not satisfactorily register the household, written notification would then be given cautioning of the danger of being omitted from the Register. Local authorities were also requested to cross check with other data that they might have (e.g council housing lists).</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am satisfied that local authorities have carried out the most extensive registration campaign in decades for the Draft Register 2007/8. The campaign has involved some 1,500 fieldworkers visiting some 1.2 million households; many of these were visited more than once so as to ensure a more accurate Register. While coordinated data on the initial Register campaign is still not finalised, indications are that there has been extensive activity with both significant additions to, and deletions from, the Register.</P>
        <P>As a result the extensive activity at local level, combined with strong media-based national awareness campaign, public interest in the registration process and its fundamental importance to democratic participation is now at a very high level.</P>
        <P>The Draft Register has now been published by each local authority. It can be checked up to 25 November in;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Council offices,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Public libraries,</P>

        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />On-line on each local authority web-site and through the central site <i>www.checktheregister.ie</i>.</P>
<P FLI="0">People aged 18 and over, who are not registered, or whose details are not correctly registered, may apply to their city or county council for registration or correction as appropriate; a form for this purpose can be downloaded from <Col N="594"/>www.checktheregister.ie. Valid registration applications will be reflected in the final Register which will be published in February 2007.</P>
        <P>The second phase of the national awareness campaign, encouraging people to check the register, will run on national and local media until 25 November.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the period after 25 November, it will be open to eligible persons still not included on the Register to secure their registration through inclusion the Supplementary Register; applications for this purpose may be made up to 15 days before polling day.</P>

	<P>Under sections 18, 19 and 20 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002, the making, amending or revoking of a local area plan is a reserved function of the elected members of the planning authority.</P>
        <P>The legislation requires a local area plan to be consistent with the objectives of the development plan and to consist of a written statement which may include objectives for the zoning of land for the use solely or primarily of particular areas for <Col N="595"/>particular purposes.  A local area plan may also include such other objectives in such detail as may be determined by the planning authority for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area to which it applies, including detail on community facilities and amenities and on standards for the design of development and structures.</P>
        <P>There are no specific provisions in the legislation regarding the granting of a derogation from the adopted local area plan.  However, Section 18 (5) of the 2000 Act states that a planning authority may at any time amend or revoke a local <Col N="596"/>area plan; a consultation and adoption process is stipulated for this purpose.</P>
        <P>As stated above, the legislation requires that a local area plan shall be consistent with the objectives of the development plan, and section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that when a planning authority is making a decision in relation to an application it shall have regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, the provisions of the development plan.  Where an application for development would materially contravene the development plan, a planning authority may decide to grant permission under section 34 (6) of the Act provided the requirements set out in that section are complied with.</P>
