        <Quest>if the level of fishing effort is in accordance with Council Regulations 1954 of 2003 and 1415 of 2004 fishing effort in western waters; if he has evidence that Spanish effort is not increasing, particularly in the area previously known as the Irish Box; if levels are being monitored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>New fishing effort levels were established for western waters following intensive negotiations during 2003 and 2004. The new regime established fishing effort levels for whitefish, scallop and crab fisheries based on the actual levels of fishing effort exerted by the various fleets over the five-year period 1998 to 2002.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P>The implementation of the new western waters regime also involved the establishment of a biologically sensitive area to the south and south west of Ireland, the so-called new Irish Box, where specific effort limits were also established. On the basis of a case made by Ireland, this area was scientifically proven as being especially sensitive owing to its importance as a spawning and nursery area to important whitefish species such as hake and megrims in particular.</P>
        <P>The fishing effort levels laid down in Council Regulation 1415 of 2004 are subject to detailed reporting requirements by all member states concerned. These maximum effort levels are legislatively enforced at EU level and any breach of those limits by the fishing fleets of any member state is subject to possible infringement proceedings by the European Commission against that member state. Therefore, the European Commission is in an effective position to monitor the situation and take action in the event of non-compliance with the limits.</P>
        <P>I am not aware that there has been an increase in effort beyond the permitted levels by the fishing vessels of any member state. As these levels reflect the fishing activity in the period 1998 to 2002, they do not allow for increases in excess of <Col N="3"/>that employed at that time. The fishing effort limits established provide the necessary protection for fish stocks in waters around Ireland, both inside and outside the Irish Box.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>What assurance can the Minister of State provide regarding the monitoring of fishing effort levels in this area? Are fishing effort levels being monitored? It has come to my attention that some Spanish interests are attempting to have the fishing effort levels of large deep water freezer trawlers currently fishing in the NAFO waters transferred to Area 7. Can the Minister of State assure Irish fishermen this will not be allowed to happen as it will result in increased fishing in the area?</P>
        <P>Can the Minister of State provide assurances on the level of monitoring? Who is undertaking this monitoring currently? The Minister of State may not be aware of such an increase in effort but how can he be sure it is not happening?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Naval Service monitors fishing activities of foreign fishing vessels as part of normal patrol missions. The Naval Service can board vessels at sea and inspect fishing gear used by vessels according to methods and criteria established and prescribed by EU fisheries legislation so vessels comply with requirements and minimum mesh sizes. Vessels are also boarded at sea and the catch inspected for compliance with EU fisheries legislation governing minimum sizes of fish. The Naval Service can also verify the proper recording of catches.</P>
        <P>Many vessels land at Irish ports so the Department&rsquo;s land-based inspectorate carries out regular checks of all vessels when they discharge fish into Irish ports. Foreign vessels, like Irish vessels, are required to give prior notification of landing, including information of the catch on board and where it is proposed to land. Inspections carried out by sea fisheries officers check when the vessels land in Ireland and check the advance notification information against the catch records in the EU fisheries log book and against the fish landed.</P>
        <P>I can give assurances that as far as is possible and practical, we carry out all necessary checks. I understand Deputy Perry&rsquo;s concern as there is a perception that such checks do not take place. These checks will continue to take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the opinion of the Minister of State regarding deep water freezer trawlers and the attempt by some Spanish interests to have fishing effort levels of large deep water vessels currently fishing in the NAFO waters transferred to Area 7? Will he resist this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a separate question. I will examine this in detail and if it will be detrimental to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be detrimental and this is a major concern. It would clean out the Irish Box.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to establish if this is the case. We signed up to the Common Fisheries Policy in January 1993, which was reviewed recently. We are obliged to comply with EU regulation. Perhaps this is a matter over which I can exercise some control and if not I will highlight it with the EU Commission.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>if measures will be forwarded to establish a strategic gas reserve; the reason Ireland is only one of three EU member states not to have such a reserve; his policy on further securing Irish gas supplies; the Irish production of natural gas; the amount of Ireland&rsquo;s supply of natural gas which is imported; the estimated reserves of indigenous natural gas left; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2222/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>While Ireland does not currently maintain a strategic gas reserve, commercial reserves of natural gas are held by licensed natural gas shippers and suppliers, including BGE. Several other EU member states, including the United Kingdom, operate a similar regime.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by BGE that, at current levels, its Kinsale reserves would supply 50% of non-daily metered customer requirements, that is, for small business and domestic use for up to 50 days. This is in addition to stocks held by BGE in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation has responsibility for monitoring on an ongoing basis the security of natural gas supply. The commission publishes an annual gas capacity statement. This provides a seven-year rolling forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand to assess the adequacy of the Irish gas transmission system, including the interconnectors. The gas capacity statement also considers whether projected supplies of gas, from indigenous sources, imports and storage, are sufficient to meet forecast demand. A key finding of the 2005 gas capacity statement is that even under unusually cold weather conditions, the Irish gas transmission system will cope with forecast demand.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, in its role as the natural gas transmission system operator, has developed contingency plans in the event of a curtailment in gas supplies. Those plans include switching gas-fired power generation plant to alternative fuels, seeking voluntary reductions from large industrial gas consumers and utilising BGEs reserves from the south-west Kinsale reservoir.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is in discussion with Marathon <Col N="5"/>Oil Ireland Limited about the development of commercial natural gas storage facilities at south-west Kinsale. It recently completed a public consultation on the proposed regulatory regime for the storage facility. Further consultation on a natural gas storage licence will commence shortly. It is planned that the storage facility will be operational by the middle of 2006. In the context of the all-island energy market development framework, the scope for a common North-South approach on storage and liquefied natural gas is also being jointly explored.</P>
        <P>There is no EU obligation to establish or hold strategic reserves of natural gas. My Department is working to transpose EU Directive 2004/67 on measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply, which will further define the roles and responsibilities of gas market players relative to security of supply, in the context of the liberalised natural gas market.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The directive also provides for the establishment of a gas co-ordination group to facilitate the co-ordination of national measures between member states in the event of a major supply disruption. The group met informally on 4 January in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine impasse and the group will meet regularly from now on given the need for the EU to co-ordinate more effectively on security of gas supply.</P>
        <P>The 2005 gas capacity statement by the Commission for Energy Regulation shows that in 2004, 81% of Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas was imported via the interconnectors with 19% supplied by indigenous production. At the end of 2004, total remaining indigenous gas reserves in fields under production or development are estimated to have been approximately 960 billion cubic feet, that is, just less than a trillion cubic feet. Taking account of subsequent production the estimated remaining reserves at the end of November 2005 were approximately 940 billion cubic feet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I send him best wishes for the new year and his last full year as Minister. The Minister referred to 50% of non-daily metered customer requirements being supplied by Kinsale. What does that mean? How much natural gas would this country have in the event of what happened between Russia and the Ukraine, which only lasted for a day or two, continuing and becoming much worse? The UK is completely integrated into the European gas network, effectively at the end of the pipe increasingly supplied by Russia. How long could we survive on Kinsale gas if another grave crisis occurred?</P>
        <P>It has been European Union policy since last year to urge all member states to have a strategic gas reserve. What attitude did the Minister take in 2004 at the EU Council discussion on this matter? Was Ireland opposed to it? As far as I <Col N="6"/>know, only three states, Ireland, the UK and Sweden, do not have strategic gas reserves. If we were to establish a further strategic gas reserve, how and where would it be done? What would be the responsibility for BGE and the CER?</P>
        <P>We have a massive reserve off the north-western coast at the Corrib field. It is projected to be able to meet approximately 60% of Irish needs for ten years at a minimum. Everybody feels we must get that gas ashore by agreement with local people as soon as possible. In that context, I understand the Minister has the final report of Advantica Consultants. Will the Minister publish it and, if so, when? What reports has the Minister received recently from Mr. Peter Cassells, the facilitator for a resolution of the Corrib dispute?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the question on strategic reserves, at present it is in terms of 50% of non-daily metered customer requirements, which includes small businesses and domestic, for up to 50 days. We use approximately 15 million to 20 million standard cubic metres per day during the winter gas demand period. Of that, approximately 9 million to 12 million standard cubic metres per day is power generation demand. Residential, industrial and commercial demand is approximately 3.5 million to 4 million standard cubic metres per day. The pipeline system itself, including the interconnectors and the ring main, contains a stock level of approximately 20 to 30 million standard cubic metres. The Kinsale field can produce approximately 1 million to 1.5 million standard cubic metres per day without storage and 4 million to 4.5 million standard cubic metres per day with storage.</P>
        <P>The figures on which the newspaper report quoted by the Deputy was based were out of date. The claim that Ireland is one of only three EU countries which does not hold strategic reserves appears to arise from a report by the Austrian energy regulator. As I noted, the data in the original statement were not up to date and the figures quoted show the storage capacities within each EU state, rather than their strategic reserves.</P>
        <P>The final part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question pertained to the Corrib gas field. While this is a separate issue in some ways , it is also closely connected. Its estimated gas reserves are in the order of 875 billion cubic feet. As the Deputy noted, these reserves have the potential to make a significant contribution towards Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas requirements. The immediate flow of gas would reduce our imports by approximately 60%.</P>
        <P>As for the status of the Advantica report and the mediation process undertaken by Peter Cassells, he has briefed me twice. As recently as one week or ten days ago, he brought me up to date regarding the people he has met and the issues which have been raised. That was the last time I spoke to him. He has met officials from the Department a number of times and he estimates that he should provide me with final <Col N="7"/>conclusions on the mediation process in the spring, over the next month or so. While the Advantica report is with the Department at present, as the Deputy is aware, the technical advisory group must make recommendations to me on the basis of the final draft report. I expect this to take place in the next few weeks and I will then consider them. However, the report will be published.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Eamon Ryan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>the steps he intends taking at Council of Ministers and European Commission level to effect radical reform of the European Common Fisheries Policy to ensure that Irish naval vessels have real-time information on the actual quota allocation that is available to each vessel fishing in Irish waters.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2519/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Common Fisheries Policy was comprehensively reviewed in 2002. One of its key outcomes was a greater emphasis on fisheries control. The reformed Common Fisheries Policy contains a specific chapter dealing with control and sets a variety of requirements that all member states must implement to ensure that fisheries resources are adequately protected.</P>
        <P>While I understand the potential benefits underpinning Deputy Eamon Ryan&rsquo;s suggestion, there would be considerable difficulties with its implementation. It would require all member states to have domestic quota management systems that allocate a quota to each vessel for every fish stock. This level of allocation is not the practice in every member state and such harmonisation is unlikely in the foreseeable future for complex reasons, including quota ownership. Therefore, quota management systems are likely to remain a matter of policy choice for each member state.</P>
        <P>However, a number of systems are in place that facilitate control of fishing vessels of other member states. For example, each member state must report to the Commission the level of uptake of their national total allowable catch for each fish species. If the total allowable catch of any species is exhausted, the control services of every member state are immediately alerted by the Commission that a fishing stop is in place for that species.</P>
        <P>Ireland also receives notification directly from individual member states of lists of fishing vessels that have access entitlement under the Community legislation on western waters. Ireland&rsquo;s control services also routinely receive information listing the entitlements of listed fishing vessels to participate in specific fisheries. It also advises the flag member state of the logged catches of vessels boarded. It is, accordingly, a matter for the flag member state to take action, <Col N="8"/>including possible prosecution, against any vessel that exceeds internal catch limits established by its administration. This co-operation can be strengthened and the impending establishment of the Community fisheries control agency in Vigo will deliver closer co-operation, thereby making a valuable contribution in the fight against illegal fishing activities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to an earlier question, the Minister of State assured the House that there is, as much as possible and practicable, a proper control system in place. I assure him that almost everyone involved in this business agrees that there is an utter lack of control in fisheries management, that there is, in effect, an utterly corrupt regime where it is impossible for the Naval Service to ascertain the individual quota for a boat and therefore police the system. In effect, there is open fishing. In those circumstances, is that any surprise?</P>
        <P>I want to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to this country&rsquo;s marine scientists, who at an Oireachtas committee last week made the remarkable statement that the figures for the system &mdash; the TACs and quotas &mdash; are plucked from thin air because no one believes the landing figures given that the system is untenable.</P>
        <P>Rather than the Minister of State coming here today and stating it is not possible to fix that fundamental flaw in the system and to even approach Brussels and say that we have a serious problem here, and rather than saying that due to complex difficulties we cannot have real time quotas, I want to know what the Minister will do. Will he continue to be the only person to claim that this system is working when if one talks to any honest fisherman, anyone in the science community or anyone who knows anything about this, they state that this is a corrupt, uncontrollable system? What will the Minister of State do about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that perhaps at some time in the future he visit a number of ports in the country &mdash; I can arrange that &mdash; and establish for himself what precisely happens when fish are landed. As I stated in reply to Deputy Perry, fishermen must advise in advance that they are landing. They have their log sheets and the sea fisheries officers can inspect them, whether they relate to bulk fish or pelagic species of demersal fish.</P>
        <P>Since I took over for marine, together with the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, I have been satisfied that our record has been a fair one. On the suggestion of corruption, that is a matter for investigations that are taking place and we are not hindering those investigations in any way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>May I suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to reply and defend the system and the sea fishery officers who do their work. We have those systems in <Col N="9"/>places. As a result of the recent review of the Common Fisheries Policy, we have these responsibilities and we are taking them seriously. I am a great believer in, and the one person who realises the importance of, managing quotas now that the landings are restricted so that we can get full advantage from this. We monitor the system on a regular basis so that we do not have a glut of fish and with the lesser quantities being landed, we can ensure better quality and maximum prices.</P>
        <P>I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Commission&rsquo;s control scoreboard of last week, from where this all has possibly emanated. It is important not to take the headline from that because that scoreboard was not a fair and balanced assessment of the situation. It referred to three of 60 species. Anyone who understands the industry knows that one cannot cut off to the last tonne or kilo at the end of the year. It referred to black scabbard, prawns and scad. All those were deducted from the quota in the previous year and therefore there were no losers. In Europe, those who understand the industry will agree that there should be an additional 10% at the end of any year, where a shortfall should lead to a carryover and an excess should lead to a reduction.</P>
        <P>I will facilitate any Member of this House, and particularly the spokespersons, in visiting ports. It is easy to criticise from the comfort of our offices in Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Representatives of the our Marine Institute told the joint committee they do not believe the landing reports. Without referring to individual cases, the system is crooked and utterly corrupt. I seek an honest answer from the Minister of State. Boats from various European countries, including France, Spain and Belgium, can openly fish in Irish waters. How can the Naval Service police the quota system when it does not know the quotas of individual boats? That is the fundamental flaw in the system. Unless the Naval Service has same day information regarding the quota a country has issued to a boat for each species, we have open fishing. Given the number of trawlers fishing in our waters and the technology available on them, our seas will be wiped clean. We have some of the best fishing grounds in the world but we are losing them because the Minister of State is turning a blind eye to that fundamental flaw. Is it acceptable that Irish naval vessels should not know what quotas are available to foreign vessels?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Action speaks louder than words. We have built quotas into our system, as far as is practicable, but that has not been adopted by all member states. The system pursued in Ireland is not corrupt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but the entire European system is corrupt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to impress this on colleagues at every opportunity. However, I must be realistic. The Common Fisheries Policy was reviewed in 2003 and it is not possible to make this change. I have no difficulty raising it because, as the custodian of the resource, I have an obligation to future generations. If the Deputy was fully familiar with this issue, he would know the Irish and UK fishing industries have always supported technical conservation measures with a view to ensuring the long-term viability of the industry. I will raise this at every opportunity but I should not be labelled with responsibility for all of Europe because I am not the commissioner.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the availability of broadband and relevant infrastructure here has almost the worst record in Europe; if he intends to issue directives or instructions to the various service providers and the regulator in an effort to accelerate the programme towards achieving relevant targets in view of the fact that in the European league Ireland&rsquo;s position has dropped from the top three to the last two with consequent implications for domestic and commercial customers; if the precise obstacles impeding development in this area have been identified; the action he proposes to take; the timetable involved to catch up with developments in other European jurisdictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services and the development and roll-out of telecommunications technology is primarily a matter for the industry itself. The telecommunications market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions, in accordance with the provisions of the Communications Regulations Act 2002.</P>
        <P>In comparison to other European counties, private broadband service providers in Ireland were relatively slow in launching competitive, affordable broadband. However, the position is improving rapidly. In late 2004, the Government set a target of 400,000 broadband subscribers to be achieved by the end of 2006. I have, however, challenged the industry to strive for 500,000 subscribers by then. The Government&rsquo;s broadband target is to be within the top half of EU countries by the end of 2007. Since 2004, broadband subscriber numbers have more than doubled and the current take-up for broadband is approximately 10,000 per month and continues to increase across a range of technologies.</P>
        <P>The latest quarterly data report published by ComReg on broadband delivery rates indicates broadband subscriptions had increased by 19% as of September 2005 to 208,000. DSL remains the largest platform for broadband access, representing 78% of subscriptions and a growth rate of 16% in the last quarter. The proportion of broadband subscriptions delivered over access platforms other than DSL has increased over the past 12 months. The estimated end December 2005 figure for broadband subscribers is 250,000, according to the regulator. In 2004 there were more than 80 Internet service providers whereas today more than 156 companies are listed by ComReg, with at least 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future. New technologies can deliver broadband to virtually any broadband customer in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Ireland is the lowest cost country in the OECD for international connectivity, our regional broadband pricing is on a par with the best in Europe and the price of basic broadband access is at the EU average.</P>

    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P><Col N="12"/>The rate of broadband uptake is dependent on a combination of factors. These include access by private sector service providers to suitable infrastructure as well as competition between broadband service providers and demand conditions for broadband in the economy. In addition to setting challenging targets to the telecommunications industry, the Government has taken a number of policy and investment initiatives to improve broadband availability.</P>
    <P>In March 2004, a number of policy directions were issued to ComReg by my predecessor, the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, relating to competition, broadband, wholesale and retail line rental, interconnection and leased lines, and national and cross-Border roaming. The direction on broadband required ComReg to use regulatory and enforcement tools, where necessary and subject to relevant requirements under European and national law, to support initiatives to develop broadband and remove regulatory barriers, if any exist, to such initiatives.</P>
    <P>Local loop unbundling, LLU, is mandated by a European Council regulation and responsibility for its implementation is a matter for ComReg under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and the transposed EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. I have no powers to issue instructions to service providers on broadband.</P>
    <P>Given that the level of investment by the sector in high-speed broadband infrastructure has failed to keep pace with the demand for broadband, my Department is addressing the local infrastructure deficit by building high-speed, open-access, fibre-based metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide. This is taking place on a phased basis, in association with the local and regional authorities, using European Regional Development Fund and Government funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Phase one of this programme has so far delivered fibre-optic networks to 27 towns and cities. The programme has been extended to a further 90 towns nationwide. Design and procurement is well advanced in most regions and construction is due to start early this year. These networks will be completed during 2006 and 2007. They allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
    <P>My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. This scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, more than 150 projects have been approved for funding under the programme. In addition, a joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools prog<Col N="13"/>ramme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband during 2006. Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dcmnr.<?oasys _jy ?>gov.ie</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that Northern Ireland, which had a similar start date in respect of the provision of broadband facilities, now has 100% service? Is he further aware that the original target set by his Department of 500,000 connections has been miserably missed and that a Forf&aacute;s report issued at the end of 2005 clearly indicates a serious deficit in terms of broadband penetration as compared with other industrialised countries with which we are in competition? Can the Minister take any initiatives to accelerate the speed with which broadband is made available and allow for the delivery to the customer of the benefits of deregulation and local loop unbundling, removing all the obstacles that have proven so significant in regard to broadband provision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Provision of broadband services in Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom roll-out, which began considerably earlier than our own. As the Deputy mentioned, there is now 100% availability in the North. However, the figures for uptake of broadband technology there are no better than those for the Republic. It may be the case that one can bring the horse to water but one cannot make it drink.</P>
        <P>The rate of broadband uptake in the Republic has accelerated in the last 18 months and there is no part of the country in which it is not available. I agree with the Deputy, however, that the cost is prohibitive in some rural areas. The initiatives we have undertaken to ensure broadband is rolled out, including the MANs programme, the broadband for schools programme and the county and group broadband scheme, are well known to the Deputy. The response to these efforts by the Government to ensure the rapid spread of broadband throughout the country has been positive.</P>
        <P>It is good that a number of reports have highlighted the necessity to continue efforts to make broadband available. Many of these reports, however, including that issued by Forf&aacute;s and other international reports, would benefit from more precise measurement techniques because they do not always compare like with like. While our basic provision of broadband is one megabyte, some of the other European countries with which we are compared provide less than half that bandwidth for broadband.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s final question, I reiterate that I have powers in this respect. My predecessor used those to issue directions to ComReg on competition and costs. That is kept under constant review. The other area where I can be helpful and proactive is in bringing forward legislation &mdash; as I will during the first half <Col N="14"/>of this year &mdash; that will give extra powers to ComReg.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the experience of the past two years, does the Minister believe it will be possible to deliver to the customer, whether industrial or domestic, the benefits of deregulation and local loop unbundling? Does he see any obstacles not possible for resolution given that the original target was for 500,000 connections more than a year ago, these targets have been revised downwards since on two occasions and it appears there is no chance of achieving these modified targets?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the target to which the Deputy refers. Since my predecessor&rsquo;s time, the target in my Department has always been 400,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 500 connections by the end of 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I challenged the industry because I believe it can deliver 500,000 connections by the end of next year. There have been many challenges in this regard. The regulator attempted to expedite the local loop and bundling, and that ended up in the High Court. No matter how good the regulation, the system in place from a European point of view and from our national legislation point of view is that once a direction is given a person or company has a right to appeal and go to the courts. There is not much I can do to prevent them from doing so. The last decision of the regulator was fought in the High Court precisely because they tried to remove Eircom&rsquo;s right of appeal to the LLU direction given. ComReg is continuing to work with the fixed line incumbent and the alternate operators to try to agree a methodology for an early roll-out of LLU. I will assist the process in any way I can.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Ferris</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>his views on the common fisheries policy; and the arrangements governing the Irish fisheries&rsquo; need to be subject to a process of review and reform.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2449/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Common Fisheries Policy was reviewed in 2002 and this led to a new basic regulation that will govern EU fisheries policy until the early part of the next decade. It is not realistic, therefore, to expect a further reform process in the interim.</P>
        <P>The 2002 reform embraced all the key areas such as access to resources, conservation, control and enforcement, structures and fleet policy. <Col N="15"/>Ireland&rsquo;s approach to these issues was informed by an expert group consisting of representatives of the Irish fishing industry, which was chaired by Mr. Padraic White. With the benefit of this detailed input, Ireland participated actively in the reform process and the reform package finally agreed contains many of the recommendations of Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy review group.</P>
        <P>The reformed Common Fisheries Policy reflects many of the concerns expressed by Ireland. These include a much stronger emphasis on stock conservation and in that regard we have since seen the introduction of recovery programmes for a number of cod stocks. Work is also under way on an action plan to address the problem of the discarding of juvenile fish catches. Other elements of the reform package include stronger control and enforcement provisions, continued recognition of Ireland&rsquo;s entitlements for additional quotas under the so-called &ldquo;Hague Preferences&rdquo; and new regional advisory councils, RACs, giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.</P>
        <P>While it is invariably the case that any member state may wish to change a certain element of the CFP at a given time, such as a wish to get a greater share of the resource or, as Deputy Ryan pointed out, changing the methodology for catch limitations, it is necessary to deal with the overall situation in a holistic manner. The 2002 reform was successful from our viewpoint and we will participate in future reform processes in a similarly progressive fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State agree that the Common Fisheries Policy has delivered a bad deal for Ireland historically and that potentially a valuable natural resource has been squandered or surrendered to Brussels? Despite the fact that we have nominal sovereignty over 11% of EU waters, with a catch quota system of 4%, we are being told that we are net beneficiaries of subsidies and so on from Europe. However, given the billions of euro worth of fish that have been caught in these waters by foreign vessels which has contributed significantly to the decline of the fish stocks in these waters, we are more of a contributor than a beneficiary in that regard.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree that radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is urgently required and that part of such reform should involve reclaiming national jurisdiction over our fishing waters? In conjunction with what Deputy Eamon Ryan said, a nationally designed strategy should be implemented to ensure that our stocks are preserved and that, crucially, our fishing communities are beneficiaries in this respect. This would involve a radical shift from the current system where most of our processing is done abroad to a proactive approach towards a domestic processing sector. Will the Minister of State submit a proposal to the EU agenda to the <Col N="16"/>effect that such radical reform be made a priority as a matter of urgency?</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Minister of State said he is an advocate regarding the quota system. I concur with and would be supportive of his view that it should be determined not on the basis of fleet but on the basis of individual vessels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Common Fisheries Policy was a bad deal. I was never happy with it and, as Minister of State, there is no point in my saying it was a good deal. I am not criticising those who negotiated it. Our party was involved. The then coalition was in Government on 1 January 1983. I am not criticising anybody for that because Members from all parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il negotiated it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s party signed it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Spread it out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I emphasise that I am not being critical but the parties involved in the negotiations at that time did not foresee the subsequent developments that would take place in our fishing industry. At that time we had very much an inshore fleet. The industry, particularly the pelagic and demersal segments, has made substantial investment over the years in terms of the purchase of larger, more modern and safer boats with RSW tanks and they can carry ice or have the facility to make ice. With that facility the quality of the fish landed is much better and our fishermen can mix their produce with that of other countries. If we were to negotiate that deal again, I would like to think that our attitude would be different but it is much easier to be an historian than a forecaster.</P>
        <P>On the point of the waters off our coast, we have the most prolific fishing grounds in the European Union but, unfortunately, we must share those with the other maritime nations in Europe. I would like to think we did not have to but we cannot dine <i>&agrave; la carte</i> in Europe. As Deputy Ferris suggested, we have 11% of EU waters and approximately a 5% share of the European quota, but that brings us into areas in which we would not normally be able to fish. In terms of our waters, I estimate that we have approximately 20% on average of quotas in the waters around our coast.</P>
        <P>I am also an advocate of management. I want to see more fish landed in Ireland and more value added to them. I have no difficulty in addressing that. Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, has addressed it. It works closely with the industry whether it be producers or processors.</P>
        <P>It would be simplistic for me to say that radical reform of the sector is on my EU agenda. I have raised that issue quite often in Europe and indicated clearly that countries such as Ireland &mdash; it being an island and the only country with two sea <Col N="17"/>crossings into Europe &mdash; should have some advantages. However, if we are to gain from that or from any changes, it means that other countries will lose out as a result. Therefore, such a scenario can only be described as zero sum game.</P>
        <P>I do not have any great difficulties with the views expressed by Deputy Ferris. At all times I try to ensure that we endeavour to maximise the quantity of fish landed. The Deputy was correct in saying that many of the boats to which we referred are Spanish boats landing produce, largely in the south west, to be put into containers which are brought back to Spain. That is of no benefit whatsoever to us. It is possible that the trucks being used are not Irish as well. I certainly feel that we should try to address that. We cannot force the other member states to do this, but they should do it if we are to make progress. I ask the Deputy to remember one thing &mdash; if more value is added to fish, that does not mean they will become more expensive. When fish are at their prime, they are fresh. They get them when there is an abundance. The more continuity of fish landings we have, the better the chance we will have.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 130, 180 and 188 together.</P>
        <P>The development and continued viability of An Post and the post office network is, in the first instance, a matter for An Post&rsquo;s board and management. An Post will continue to have a key national role in the delivery of mail and as a quality service provider of Government and financial services through its nationwide network of post office outlets. As the market for traditional postal and post office services is changing throughout the world, it is more important than ever to meet customer needs. Globalisation, liberalisation and developments in technology are changing the way people communicate so it is important for national postal operators, including An Post, to change rapidly if they are to remain competitive and commercial in the European postal market. In that context, An Post needs to make the best possible use of its long established and trusted brand name, to deploy its resources in a manner that continues to serve existing customers&rsquo; needs and attract additional customers for a range of new services.</P>
        <P>It has been agreed that change is required if An Post&rsquo;s postal services are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer customers a top class nationwide delivery service. The board and management of An Post have prepared a recovery plan, incorporating details of proposed new collection and delivery arrangements, with that in mind. The plan is central to the re-establishment of the company on a more secure financial footing.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations on proposed new collection and delivery arrangements have been accepted following extensive negotiations between An Post&rsquo;s management and trade unions. This welcome development will pave the way for the full implementation of the change programme that is essential if the company is to be placed on a firm financial footing and to secure its future in an increasingly competitive and technologically changing market.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the future of the post office network. The Government and the board of An Post are committed to continuing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network, as set out in the programme for Government. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, the Government clearly recognises the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. An Post&rsquo;s development strategies for the network continue to take full account of such social benefits. As a commercial company, An Post is challenged with developing a strategy that satisfies the needs of existing customers and attracts new customers to the post office. It has had some success in winning new business and continues to benefit from a considerable amount of Government business, especially in areas like social welfare payments and savings products.</P>
        <P>The An Post network comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country. <Col N="19"/>Ireland has the largest number of post offices per head of population in Europe. Some network restructuring has been undertaken in recent years, in line with similar trends across Europe. In addition to the post office network, An Post has established 2,864 Postpoint outlets in retail premises, of which 600 can be used for full bill payment. The Government intends to maintain the largest economically sustainable post office network possible. The challenge for An Post&rsquo;s stakeholders is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size. The Government will support the network in any way it can. It demonstrated that commitment in a tangible fashion by providing for a capital injection of &euro;12.7 million in 2003. An Post needs to enhance its existing services and build on its existing strengths by developing new product offerings. If the network is to capitalise on the advantages it enjoys as a consequence of its high footfall, existing and new services should be developed to meet customer requirements.</P>
        <P>The network also has the capacity and potential to deliver more private business especially in the financial services and opportunities are being actively pursued by An Post in this area. On foot of substantial investment in computerisation a significant amount of extra business has already been obtained for the network in terms of banking and utility business. Currently, 95% of An Post business is conducted through automated offices. I have also asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network. In the light of this An Post is working on a new financial services initiative which could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices. If this initiative proves to be successful it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the enhanced viability of the network.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment all concerned in the resolution of the dispute that ended in the acceptance of the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations which gave a new lease of life to the post office services. What efforts are being made to accelerate the degree to which the post office network can meet the ongoing and ever-increasing customer needs and provide new services? Will the Minister give an indication of the degree to which he expects the utilisation of the network in future given that its competitors and the domestic customer are willing to utilise those services? In regard to the downgrading of existing post offices to sub-post offices and the closure of some, which can have a fundamental impact on the whole structure of the network, will he give an indication that this will not be done to the extent that it will undermine the whole fabric of the network which is a valuable entity? Will he indicate <Col N="20"/>whether other Departments, including the Department of Social and Family Affairs, will not only continue to utilise but increase their usage of An Post services? Some indication was given that parcel and packaging services might be restored. In view of the growth of private or independent packaging services is there a possibility of the restoration of services in that area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of any plans to go back to an SDS type operation in respect of parcel post. That service was set up a few years ago and had to be closed quickly. The work on the closing of that service was completed only in the middle of last year. I am not aware of any decision to revert. I am aware An Post will aggressively market its parcel service through the normal post and is seeking to compete with private couriers for that end of the market. On the question of other Government services, at every available opportunity the Government is seeking to ensure that any services that can be provided through the post office network will be so provided. The most recent service is the fine paying system, on which agreement has been reached between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the postal service. The Government made a decision some years ago to ensure, where possible, that each Department, in line with public procurement policies, would try to provide services through An Post to enhance the viability of the post office network.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the post office network throughout the country, I mentioned in my reply that we still have the highest number of post offices per head of population of any country in Europe. I am aware that many people attended meetings of the IPU before Christmas. At those meetings even the IPU questioned whether we could sustain the post office network and the current number of post offices into the future. In light of its report and other issues it had with An Post I have asked Eamon Ryan to assist it in negotiating with An Post to try to enhance its position which in turn would enhance the post office network. I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s acknowledgment of the resolution of the dispute. Hopefully, we can move forward and that the remaining matters that need to be resolved, as part of the Labour Court decision, can be finalised.</P>
        <P>Competition is increasing. An Post needs to modernise to adapt. I have no doubt with goodwill on all sides that can happen. If by 2009 An Post is not in a healthy state and able to compete with the best in the private sector it will have a major difficulty. I am confident it will adapt, accelerate the change process and will be in a healthy state at that time and able to withstand competition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>How many post offices have closed since the Minister came into office in the past 16 months? In view of what the Minister said <Col N="21"/>about expanding the new financial services initiatives, how can that be delivered if post offices are closing month by month and the network is getting smaller, having been decimated since 1990? It plays a very important role in rural life. Everybody welcomes the resolution of the dispute. Part of the resolution, dating from when the Minister came to office, was that the Minister would bring forward the miscellaneous provisions Bill in respect of the ESOP provisions. Will the Minister bring back that legislation given that it was on the cl&aacute;r of the D&aacute;il for years?</P>
        <P>ComReg said only 71% of letters are delivered next day as against the target of 94%. Is the embargo on recruitment which An Post management implemented approximately 18 months ago still in force? It means that for several weeks in recent months towns such as Asbourne, in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, have had no post.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was terrible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It was desperate. I understand the term of office of the chief executive of the management team of An Post, Mr. Curran, and his chief operations officer will come to an end this summer. Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to make changes to An Post management?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The board of An Post is the body responsible for changes in management. I do not have any plans to interfere in that process and it would not be a healthy exercise. I am sure several Deputies would accuse me of creating jobs for the boys if I decided to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We would never accuse the Minister of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not interfere in that process. The Deputy is correct in saying the term of office of the chief executive ends in the middle of the year but, as I have said, that is a mater for the board. On the question about the embargo on recruitment, that is a matter for An Post but my understanding is that agreement has been reached. The Labour Court recommendation has been accepted by both sides but has not been implemented. A number of issues have to be worked out. Company management made a decision some time back that in order to keep An Post viable it would not recruit staff to fill in for people that were missing due to the high absentee rate in the An Post workforce on a continuous basis. It decided not to do anything in the area of recruitment until all issues were resolved, and to my knowledge that is how the matter stands.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with Deputy Broughan about next day delivery. The levels are not satisfactory whether one goes by the ComReg or An Post figures. The levels are way short of what they should be, but I hope that once the new agreement and so on is fully in place these levels will increase. They must improve. We need the percentage of <Col N="22"/>next day delivery to be in the mid-90s rather than the current low 70s.</P>
        <P>I accept some post offices are closing but I do not have the figures off the top of my head. I cleared a written reply to a question from the Deputy in recent days on this matter and the figures will be available to him through that. We have the largest number of post offices per head of population of any country in Europe. The latest information I have is that there are 96 company offices, in the region of 1,400 sub-post offices and 160 postal agencies operating nationwide. Some 1,000 of these offices are automated. We have a very good spread. No part of Ireland is any more than 5 km from the nearest post office, Postpoint or postal agency. The question is whether we can sustain that into the future.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the current levels of the network and would probably also be satisfied with lower levels. I am also satisfied that the proposed financial services initiative being taken by An Post, which is being negotiated with a number of tenderers, would be perfectly viable with the current network. I am sure those who are avidly competing for that An Post joint venture have taken all that into account and are satisfied.</P>

	<P>What about the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I withdrew the Bill because no ESOP was going to take place in the current circumstances. I hope we can resume with the Bill when the company gets back into profit, but I do not anticipate that will be done in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister acknowledged that sub-post offices are closing. Does he realise that the reason this is happening is that when post masters or post mistresses retire it does not pay people to take up the job. In Connemara, the post office recently closed in Maam and I was at a meeting in Cashel last night, which is more than 5 km from any other post office, where the post office also closed. When small post offices close, people no longer wish to take up the job of post master or post mistress because it would not pay them to keep an office open for the small return they would get. Instead of the pay per item system operating in these sub-post offices, is it possible for An Post or the Minister to introduce a system of flat rate payment to post masters or post mistresses to keep post offices open in rural areas?</P>
        <P>As the Minister has acknowledged, much of the work is now done in other ways. Television licences can be paid on-line and the post office is not required for such transactions but it is an essential part of the community. In view of the many social benefits attached to the post office referred to by the Minister, would it be possible to make a flat rate of payment to sub-post<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="23"/><?oasys _fc ?>masters and sub-post mistresses instead of a pay per item system?</P>
        <P>On what was the &euro;12.7 million referred to by the Minister spent? Was any of it spent in an endeavour to keep rural sub-post offices open? In Connemara the Maam and Cashel post offices have already closed and the post offices in Cornamona and Clonbur are in danger of being closed simply because when the post master or post mistress retires nobody will take on the job because on the current rate of pay it would not pay anybody to keep an office open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The &euro;12.7 million that was paid out in 2003 was largely spent on automation of post offices, although there were other areas of expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>On what was the money spent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the automation of post offices in various parts of the country. The second question asked by the Deputy relates to a contractual matter between post masters and post mistresses, who are represented by the IPU, and An Post. I have had a number of discussions with the IPU in regard to contracts, rates of payment and so on and it put forward various proposals, but that is a matter between the union and An Post. For that reason I have engaged Eamon Ryan to work with the IPU and An Post to examine all the issues concerning post masters, levels of remuneration, contracts and so on to see if they can be improved. He has undertaken to do that work within a specified period of time.</P>
        <P>The post masters have asked Farrell Grant Sparks to produce a report, which has been done, and this will be used as a basis for discussion between the parties. I agree with Deputy McCormack that a number of issues need to be resolved between An Post and post masters and post mistresses. If that can be achieved it would probably make the job more attractive to people and would help to maintain a strong nationwide service.</P>
        <P>Automated post offices account for 95% of the business but I agree with the Deputy that the remaining 5% of post offices may be located in rural areas where, we should not forget, the social service element of An Post must be taken into account. The best way to ensure that we maintain the network is to make sure that An Post is a strong and viable company that can do the kind of business it needs to do.</P>

        <QRef>[2123/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The digital hub project, managed by the independent Digital Hub Development Agency, has been and will continue to be successful in developing a digital industry cluster, as well as in regenerating a historic community area in the heart of Dublin by operating a number of significant community and educational initiatives as part of its role in the digital hub district.</P>
        <P>On 5 October, the agency announced a competition to develop over five acres of land in the digital hub. This land is to be developed as a mixture of residential, commercial and retail properties, in addition to public spaces. The private developers competed on the basis of bids of cash plus office space. The office space will be handed back to the digital hub agency and will be used to accommodate an increased number of digital enterprises in the area.</P>
        <P>On 22 November, I announced the acceptance of tenders for two sites, with a combined area of almost 5.6 acres for approximately &euro;118 million. In return for the land, the State will receive a combination of &euro;72.4 million in cash and &euro;45.7 million in high quality offices, which will accommodate digital enterprises as the digital hub grows. The breakdown of the tenders means that the digital hub will receive over 13,000 sq. m., 140,000 sq. ft., of office space.</P>
        <P>The digital hub has engaged with local community interests on the project from the beginning. The consultation takes place through the unique community, public, private partnership, CPPP, process, which is chaired by DHDA board member, Peter Cassells.</P>
        <P>As a result of the consultation, the two private developers are required under the terms of the development contract to engage with the local community through the CPPP process. The successful tenderers will now be required to make a planning application within six months and on receipt of planning to construct the office space offered. They must engage with interested parties through the CPPP process. The office space will facilitate the future expansion of the digital hub by accommodating digital media enterprises. The amount to be used for residential or other com<Col N="25"/>mercial purposes will be a matter for the tenderers and the planning authorities.</P>
        <P>With regard to industry development, the agency has been successful to date in growing the cluster with about 50 companies now employing approximately 500 people in the hub. These enterprises are involved in a range of activities including games software development, mobile technology, animation and TV production.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the five and a half acres, which I understand went to the builders Manor Park Homebuilders Ltd. and P.<?oasys _jy ?>Elliott &amp; Company, what proportion of the original digital hub area will remain in office and enterprise development? When the Minister and I were last at the hub together, when the Minister was making an announcement, a number of the wonderful young entrepreneurs we met complained bitterly about the lack of capacity. Even with 30,000 square metres, will there be enough capacity for development?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister intend to issue any long-term directives regarding the core operation strategy of the hub? The Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Brendan Tuohy, reported to the Committee of Public Accounts before Christmas that Media Lab Europe had refused to give him key information about the operation of the project. Have we since obtained that information? Has the Minister been in contact with Dublin City Council regarding the proposal for an urban wireless hotspot for the entire city, which many other cities have implemented?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding Media Lab Europe, when I became aware through the Committee of Public Accounts that information was not forthcoming to the committee from the liquidator, I wrote a letter and the matter was followed up by Brendan Tuohy, the Secretary General of the Department. I am not sure if the information has yet been given to the Committee of Public Accounts but all information on this matter should be made available to it and I support the efforts to get that information.</P>
        <P>Regarding the hub strategy, Deputy Broughan is correct in stating that the two successful tenderers are Manor Park Homebuilders Ltd. and P. Elliott &amp; Company. They must now approach the Dublin City Council and get planning permission. I have no idea what proportion of the site will be residential or commercial. There was informal contact from the DHDA in the earlier stages of this process to ascertain what would be broadly acceptable. The project cannot be done without the full co-operation and assistance of the city council, which will be conscious of the need to balance the commercial and especially the residential element in that area, because apart from the digital cluster, one of the major aims is to renew that element from a living point of view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the general strategy for the hub, much good work has been done. The hub has <Col N="26"/>been very successful in attracting companies and creating employment. It has been particularly successful with regard to the Liberties learning initiative, with which Deputy Broughan is familiar, and the education work being done. Over the past 12  months there was a particular focus on getting the developer competition finished and out of the way, and there will now be a greater focus on the central work of the hub itself. I am currently awaiting a business plan from the hub which will outline that strategy over the next four or five years. Part of it will be the development of the new digital research centre, about which I hope we can make a formal announcement in the very near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister indicate to the House the full extent of public investment in the digital hub project, the total outlay involved and the degree of recovery, or potential recovery, at a later stage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am subject to correction, but allowing for what we are to get for these two sites, &euro;118 million, and what we have already spent, the outgoings and income are about level. That does not take into account the other property owned by the State in the digital hub area, so we would be ahead in a positive sense in terms of value.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On 23 November last year I asked if the Taoiseach would take personal responsibility for the Government action in dealing with the carnage on our roads. In 2003, 335 people lost their lives on Irish roads. In 2004 the figure was 370 and in 2005 the figure was 399. The roads are littered with monuments to tragic accidents and lost lives. So far this year, 29 people have lost their lives in road accidents.</P>
      <P>In the national road safety strategy, the Government quite rightly set out a series of targets. The problem is that those targets have not been achieved and cannot be achieved when they are not underpinned by the policies and resources <Col N="28"/>necessary to achieve them. The record in this area is littered with broken promises. The Taoiseach will recall the Government&rsquo;s solemn promise made in 1998 to roll out speed cameras nationally within two years. Seven years later, only three out of 20 speed cameras are operational at any one time in the greater Dublin area. The Taoiseach will also recall that 69 penalty point procedures were to be introduced by the end of 2003, and two years later, only four of those have been introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, who is absent, has repeatedly promised a road traffic Bill to deal with the issue of random breath testing and to enable the deployment of more speed cameras. However, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s programme for legislation, announced today, shows no such legislation in preparation. While it is obvious to everybody that driving behaviour is down to each individual, if a lackadaisical approach is taken to this matter and if individuals assume or perceive they can drive in excess of the speed limit, in excess of the alcohol limit and following drug substance abuse in many cases, they will do so.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The record of the Government in dealing with the carnage on the roads has been a dismal failure. The Government has failed on every promise it made, despite quite rightly setting out specific targets under the road safety strategy. Given that the Minister for Transport has failed utterly to deal with this issue, is the Taoiseach prepared to take personal charge to drive the matter from his office to see that real improvements and progress can be made, which hopefully will allow the targets set out in the national road strategy to be achieved and tragic and unfortunate road deaths reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of road deaths and the carnage on the roads is both disappointing and disturbing. At the start, we should remember all those who have unfortunately lost their lives in recent weeks and months. As Deputy Kenny said, the primary target for the Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 was to reduce road deaths to no more than 300 per annum by the end of 2006. That target will be very difficult to achieve with the number of deaths at 374 for 2004 and 399 for 2005.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that legislation has been the difficulty in this area. We have an enormous number of legislative measures and another legislative measure, the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will shortly be before the House, which will give increased powers in a number of areas, including some of the ones the Deputy mentioned. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has announced plans to develop a traffic corps in each divisional area, with far greater numbers than at present. While the traffic corps is in operation at present, it is planned to use the increased number of garda&iacute; to bring up to 900, if I recall the figure, the number of traffic <Col N="29"/>corps garda&iacute; around the country dealing every day, day and night, with traffic issues.</P>
      <P>There has been the major extension of the application of the penalty points system, including the working of the technology system, which was slow to get off the ground, from the existing five offences to 35 offences, which will be launched in springtime. There is a continued focus on driver behaviour and key safety issues, such as dangerous overtaking and failure to obey traffic lights, stop signs, yield signs and vehicle crossing centre lines. There are the fixed charges that have been applied to offences &mdash; they will be applied to almost 60 offences. The vast majority of those are the 35 penalty points offences referred to. The Minister for Finance will make a detailed announcement on these matters in the morning. The extension will be facilitated by introducing a series of statutory instruments; primary legislation is not required in these areas.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the introduction of legislation to support the operation of privately owned speed cameras. Decisions on the locations where cameras will be provided will be taken by the Garda. I understand the Garda Commissioner is appearing before the Joint Committee on Transport dealing with traffic issues. I know that is an issue he will address at that committee. This is to be based on reflecting both the experience of speed-related collisions and evidence of a history of speeding. It is not a willy-nilly approach that cameras are stuck everywhere and anywhere on open stretches, they are in the crucial areas around the country.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of random roadside breath testing. We have come to a conclusion on that matter. There has been a lot of legal debate on what is constitutional. The Attorney General has given his advice on the matter. It is legal and constitutional to have random breath testing. It must be done in a particular way, but that will be done. That will be announced as well. In the past few days we have conveyed that to the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the advice of the Attorney General was the direct opposite to what the Taoiseach just read out. I drive between 40,000 and 50,000 miles per year and the numbers of road checks I come across throughout the country are few and far between. The public like to see garda&iacute; conducting traffic checks. However, the perception is that the penalty points system is being used as a money gathering exercise with garda&iacute; checking for speed as drivers leave a town between the 50 km/h and 60 km/h speed limits.</P>
      <P>The Government is not really serious about the matter. It has done nothing about the use of mobile phones when people are driving. It has done nothing about roadside drug testing. I understand that of those who tested positive at least 20% were driving following substance abuse. The Government has done nothing about real training for motorcyclists, who now come up <Col N="30"/>behind cars at considerably in excess of 100 mph in many cases, as I have seen personally. The Government has done nothing about cutting back on the number of people driving with provisional licences, which exceeds 400,000 &mdash; the vast majority of these drivers are unaccompanied by a full licence holder. It has done nothing about a real education programme for young people or for non-nationals driving here who come from a different culture and who may have difficulty switching over at short notice to driving on the left as opposed to the right hand side.</P>
      <P>The Government could have taken far more decisive action in attempting to meet its targets, as set out in the road safety strategy, to save lives, which is what it is about. The Minister for Transport has failed in his responsibility to achieve these targets and has let the Government down. I again ask the Taoiseach, as I did on 23 November, whether he is prepared to personally take charge of this element of a fundamental issue relating to safety on Irish roads and use the power of the Office of the Taoiseach to see that these things happen. The public will obey, but they must know the regulations exist and are enforced. It is the responsibility of the Taoiseach to see that the facilities and resources are provided to ensure that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1998 the Government has had road strategy programmes designed to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. While I accept that any number of injuries or deaths on the roads is too high, to the best of my recollection, the figures for 1998 were higher than they are today. At that time there were only approximately 1 million vehicles on the roads while there are more than 2 million vehicles today. However, when people are dying that is not the way to look at it. In spite of improved roads, more garda&iacute;, more legislation and more powers, we need to continue doing that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to cameras and where the garda&iacute; locate checkpoints. That was the point I was making. It is not an issue of troubling the public at easy locations. It is looking at places where historically experience shows evidence of a history of speeding, where speed-related collisions occur and where serious accidents and fatalities occur. That is where we should put the traffic corps and the speed cameras. We have a system of offences. There are also the issues of responsibility and training. I appreciate that a high number of non-nationals are among the fatalities, perhaps because of their inexperience of our road laws. All those matters are being rolled out and are being pursued. That is the reason for the huge increase in the traffic corps and for so many additional resources being given to the road safety strategy. The Minister will outline some more of those tomorrow.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that it is always a case of big brother trying to stop people rather than looking after themselves. If that is the way it is, the <Col N="31"/>Government must follow with tough measures that will inconvenience the public and not only those who break the law. The Government is prepared to do that.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Attorney General&rsquo;s advice on the random roadside breath testing is not that it is unconstitutional. To stop every single vehicle is not considered to be a fair way of applying the law but to stop vehicles randomly is. It will put some fear into drivers who, in many cases, do not care about this. The Attorney General&rsquo;s advice is that we can do this and that is the way we propose to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been a number of significant developments since I last asked the Taoiseach about the situation at Shannon Airport on 12 December. The Irish Human Rights Commission expressed its serious concern on 23 December. The interim report of Senator Marty has added to the concerns. During the Christmas recess, my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, uncovered two defence treaties that have not been laid before the House, even though they date back to January 2003 and February 2004. While the Minister for Defence has apologised for their not being laid before the House, they still were not laid before the House as at lunch time today.</P>
      <P>There is acute concern here about what might be happening as a result of the Americans being facilitated at Shannon Airport in the process of what they call &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo;. There is growing international concern about the same issue. It is a major issue in British politics, yet all that we can find out from our Government is that it has diplomatic assurances to the effect that &ldquo;nothing untoward&rdquo; is happening. How do we know that nothing untoward is happening? More and more of our citizens are asking whether our Government wants to know.</P>
      <P>The State watchdog established by the Government said that reliance on diplomatic assurance is not sufficient to protect against the risk of torture and other forms of ill treatment. The UN Commissioner has made the same statement and the European Court of Human Rights made the same point.</P>
      <P>Is it the case that civilian aircraft are being disguised for the purpose of extraordinary rendition travelling through Shannon Airport? If state aircraft are being disguised for CIA purposes, it is in breach of the Chicago Convention. On the other hand, if they are orthodox civilian aircraft, we may inspect them. Does the Taoiseach intend to take any steps to have such aircraft inspected on behalf of the Government to reassure the people that the process of extraordinary rendition, which is repulsive to our citizens, is not happening with our facilitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, the Irish Human Rights Commission wrote to me <Col N="32"/>over the Christmas and new year period. There have been discussions in the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs on this issue. We welcome the publication of Senator Marty&rsquo;s memorandum and will follow his future work on this matter in every way we can.</P>
      <P>The memorandum summarises the various allegations made and does not appear to reveal any new information. He accurately records the Government&rsquo;s complete opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition. We have constantly made it clear that we cannot and will not permit extraordinary rendition through Irish territory. The senator notes the Government&rsquo;s total condemnation of the practice. We are wholly opposed to torture or any breaches of international law under any of the conventions. I make this absolutely clear.</P>
      <P>The Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, and the US authorities have given repeated, clear and explicit face to face assurances to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, acting on the Government&rsquo;s behalf, no later than the period prior to Christmas, that no prisoners have been transferred through Irish airports to Guatemala or anywhere else. We have put this to them on a number of occasions. We have put it to diplomats and others. The assurances we have received from the United States, which Deputy Rabbitte will appreciate, are unqualified and straightforward. Prisoners have not been transferred and will not be. These assurances differ from those received by other European governments.</P>
      <P>We have been very clear about the position. I know the Deputy is concerned, as is every Member of the House and member of the public, that our facilities, which we have given because of historical connections, should not be used for the purpose of rendition. This is the latest position. I assure the House that we will co-operate fully with the Irish Human Rights Commission and the investigation by the Council of Europe, which has also written. We will co-operate with all of those in dealing with any guidelines or other issues put forward. We are happy to co-operate with the European Parliament and the PACE investigations. We have not been contacted in that regard but will give our full co-operation in an up front way.</P>

	<P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach has said but Senator Marty will not board aircraft at Shannon Airport. The question is whether the Taoiseach is still relying on diplomatic assurance and, from his reply, the answer appears to be that he is. I have cited three authorities that say reliance on diplomatic assurance is not sufficient, those being the European Court of Human Rights, the UN Commissioner responsible for monitoring matters relating to torture and the Irish Human Rights Commission, which was clear that it was not sufficient. However, as far as the Government is concerned, this is precisely where the issue rests.</P><Col N="33"/>
      <P>Should I take it from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply that he does not intend to take any steps to be satisfied that the obnoxious procedure of extraordinary rendition is not being facilitated at Shannon Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach take any steps to be satisfied and reassure the Irish public that this is not happening? There is no point in saying that he is opposed to it. The question is whether the Government is trying to find out whether it is happening.</P>
      <P>The United States is a friendly government that misled the Taoiseach, who seems to have been a willing dupe in the matter of the excuse for invading Iraq in the first place. There were no weapons of mass destruction but we were assured there were. We were treated to a presentation at the United Nations as to the location of the weapons of mass destruction. They did not exist.</P>
      <P>Why should we, merely because we are talking about a friendly government, in light of the stature of the organisations I have quoted who say one cannot rely on diplomatic assurance alone, continue to rely on diplomatic assurance? Does the Government intend to cause any steps to be taken to establish whether extraordinary rendition is happening here? My understanding of what Dr. Rice said is that she neither confirmed nor denied that prisoners are being transported through Shannon Airport. She denied that they were being transported for the purpose of torture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No. It was unqualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to make the position clear again. Deputy Rabbitte correctly stated that there are a number of investigations going on, such as that of the Irish Human Rights Commission. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe has asked for responses to questionnaires, which we will give. We will be happy to co-operate with the European Parliament and the PACE investigations.</P>
      <P>Last week, the European Parliament set up a temporary committee to investigate the allegations of transport and illegal detention of prisoners by the CIA in European countries. Our MEPs of all parties are involved. Rapporteur of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the committee on legal affairs, Senator Marty, presented an information memorandum on the issue. It states there is no formal, irrefutable evidence of the existence of secret CIA detention centres in any member state. However it finds that individuals have been rendered to countries where they have suffered degrading treatments and torture. Sources for this <Col N="34"/>include former and present CIA officials, European government officials and NGO personnel. We will co-operate with regard to any of those areas.</P>
      <P>We did not sit back and ignore this, nor have we taken the view that if we do not ask the question we will not get an answer. We have not only relied on diplomatic responses. Condoleezza Rice is Secretary of State of the United States and a senior representative, not a diplomat. It has been made absolutely clear. She has stated that no rendition has taken place through Shannon at any time, ever. This is the unqualified position. She has given categoric assurances. This was confirmed as late as yesterday by the ambassador and we have kept monitoring this position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte understands that for me to go beyond that, I could only call senior American officials one thing and I am not prepared to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The sharks in the financial markets are pushing for the early privatisation of Aer Lingus. The Government took a decision in principle last year that it would privatise the company and leave an island nation without a publicly-owned air transport vehicle, which many see as a strategic interest.</P>
      <P>What is the Government&rsquo;s position? Will it shamefully hand the national airline and its staff to transnational corporations whose only agenda is the maximisation of profit? The Taoiseach must tell us today. Aer Lingus staff, their families and the communities around the airport dependent on this employment are increasingly anxious about Government plans and are being left in the dark.</P>
      <P>The Government has the option of investing in Aer Lingus as there is no barrier to such public investment. It could develop it as a vibrant transport vehicle, with staff brought to the heart of the matter. We need very clear answers to the following questions. Does the Taoiseach intend going ahead with the privatisation? If so, how will the Government do so &mdash; by a trade sale, by flotation on the stock exchange or by other means? When will the Taoiseach put this process into effect? What is the deadline and the schedule of the Government? The Taoiseach should be very clear and precise in his answers.</P>

	<P>I confirm to Deputy Higgins that the Government will stick by the announcement of last summer concerning the comprehensive growth plan for Irish aviation that puts the aviation sector on a clear, upward growth path. We will provide new external capital to Aer Lingus and we will examine how this can be best done. This will mean that part of Aer Lingus will be sold to allow the airline to expand. We will <Col N="35"/>continue with the plans for the terminal and the other initiatives necessary for Dublin Airport to deal with 30 million passengers and to allow for the development, securing and safeguarding of Aer Lingus into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has broken his new year&rsquo;s resolution on his first day back. I asked him a number of precise questions. Judging by newspaper articles I read recently, the staff at the National Museum got more information out of Clonycavan man, and the poor man was dead for 2,000 years in a bog, than the Taoiseach has provided today. The Taoiseach is very much alive in front of me. I might call him neo-liberal man.</P>
      <P>The Union Bank of Switzerland, one of the advisers on the future of Aer Lingus, stated the Government should move to privatise within six months. Recently, in a national newspaper, a spokesman for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Martin Cullen, was asked if the Government was prepared to follow the advisers&rsquo; recommendations to conduct the initial public offering in the short term. Deputy Cullen&rsquo;s spokesman replied that Ministers were working to that agenda: &ldquo;If the market conditions are right, the answer is yes&rdquo;. Will the Taoiseach confirm the Minister and the Government are working to a short-term privatisation and that it may happen this summer? I ask the Taoiseach to be clear as he knows the answers.</P>
      <P>Is it appropriate that top management in Aer Lingus, which is owned by the community and the taxpayers, should be blatantly urging privatisation when they are likely to become millionaires within a few years of the process? Is there not a despicable conflict of interest here? Should they not be prohibited from doing so? I put my original questions again and ask the Taoiseach to provide answers very clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Deputy Higgins listen to the answers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have stated time and time again that the Government will maintain a strategic interest in Aer Lingus. We have stated we will allow an equity injection which means a sale of a proportion of Aer Lingus. This will be decided following the consultant&rsquo;s advice in the area. The purpose of this is to prevent what happened in 1993 and some four or five years ago, when Aer Lingus nearly went down the tubes. Deputy Higgins must stop trying to close the national airline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

	<P>We want to secure Aer Lingus, secure the staff, secure the jobs and help to develop the airline, including new long haul routes to Thailand, Singapore and Bahrain. If Deputy Higgins thinks the ancient ways of rusty aircraft will keep the airline going for the future he is off his head.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations in the final report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, the McEntee commission of investigation was established to examine certain aspects of the investigation in this <Col N="37"/>jurisdiction of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974, arising from findings made by Mr. Justice Barron.</P>
        <P>I previously granted an extension of the timeframe for the completion of the report from 14 November 2005 to 31 January 2006. I also published an interim report from Mr. McEntee and placed a copy in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>Earlier this month, Mr. McEntee wrote to my Department stating that more time was required to complete the inquiry in order to pursue a possible new line of investigation that had recently arisen. He therefore requested a further extension of the timeframe until 28 February 2006. I have granted that extension.</P>
        <P>He also provided me with a further interim report, as required by legislation. I have decided to publish that report today and will place a copy in the Oireachtas Library. That report is procedural in nature.</P>
        <P>To date, some &euro;925,000 has been expended on the commission of investigation. It is envisaged that the total cost of the work of the commission will be approximately &euro;1.215 million. It should be noted that, notwithstanding the extensions which have been granted to Mr. McEntee, the cost and timeframe of this investigation are both significantly below that likely to apply to a tribunal of inquiry into similar matters. I am grateful to Mr. McEntee and his staff for the expeditious and effective way in which they have conducted their work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach raise this matter with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair? I understand he will meet him tomorrow. It will soon be the sixth anniversary of the beginning of the investigations into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Will the Taoiseach take into account that to date we have not managed to obtain all the necessary information to satisfy the need for answers the families of victims have in particular and all of us have in general, given the bizarre events of that time? Given that the Barron inquiry and the Oireachtas hearings were not statutory and that the McEntee commission of investigation is examining the Garda inquiry but does not deal with collusion, is the Taoiseach still open to the need for a public tribunal of inquiry on this matter? Will he put any further questions to the British Prime Minister to bring forth the information? Will the Taoiseach tell him how far he is prepared to go to ensure we get to the bottom of this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will go over my response again because I know there was quite an amount of noise when I began my reply. We should not discount what the sole member of the commission, Mr. Paddy McEntee SC, stated in his report and his requirement for more time. He states that on 11 January he received an offer of a meeting with certain entities whose assistance and co-operation he had been assiduously seek<Col N="38"/>ing for some considerable time. He believes there is a likelihood one or more of these entities has in their custody evidence, documentation or information relevant to the specific matters covered by the terms of reference of his investigation. He states in his letter to me that he is satisfied were the commission not to attempt to follow up this possible new line of investigation, it may not be available in the future. It is for that reason we gave the extension of time.</P>
        <P>This is an important move on the part of those unspecified entities. It is a helpful move in the process and not just in terms of what Mr. McEntee is doing on the Garda investigation, the issues relating to Portland Row and the Four Courts Hotel and security individuals on the docks. It is to be hoped that this development will help to bring more clarity to the situation. For that reason, at the request of the McEntee commission, we agreed to the extension of time to allow those meetings take place.</P>
        <P>It has come about through the efforts of this House, my raising the issue with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and the assiduous efforts of Mr. McEntee in making clear what he requires.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked two basic questions. A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer will do. Will the Taoiseach raise the issue with British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair and is he open to a public inquiry on the matter if necessary? I heard the answer given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was attempting to highlight the more significant point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard it already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad. I will raise with Mr. Blair the point on whether the information will be made available. I told the House that meetings have been arranged to discuss the information. I always raise the issues with him. In terms of a full inquiry into all the aspects from throughout the period, most of these issues are from a long time ago and that process will not work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what the Taoiseach stated on the extension of time. When does he believe Mr. McEntee is likely to submit his report? Does the Taoiseach know whether Mr. McEntee is satisfied with the level of co-operation he receives from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? In particular, is the Taoiseach in possession of any information about the files that went missing which, if not critical, seem to be relevant to this inquiry? Will the Taoiseach give assurances to the House in the event of persons being revealed to be responsible for these events that they will not be covered by an amnesty or protected from due process?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will publish Mr. McEntee&rsquo;s second interim report which includes some pro<Col N="39"/>cedural detail that explains his progress on this matter. Rather than second-guessing him, I will make the report available. I do not have information to suggest he is unhappy with the level of co-operation and assistance he receives. I know a large number of previously uncovered files have been uncovered for him during the examination. I understand the extension date he has requested is 28 February and I have granted that extension. I do not want to state the matter will not arise again but that is the extension he has requested.</P>
        <P>It was never likely that the people involved in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings would surface at this stage, even under a possible amnesty. The Barron inquiry has shown that many of the people suspected of being involved are long since dead and it is unclear whether those still alive are in the jurisdiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government gave an initial extension until 31 January and one of the reasons given was that the Garda Commissioner was asked to invoke certain procedures available to him to obtain for the commission disclosure of documentation relevant to the investigation that was not available at the time. Does the Taoiseach know what progress was made in this regard? Another reason for the extension was to allow the commission to meet certain personnel and see certain documents on the British side. Does the Taoiseach know what progress was made in this regard?</P>
        <P>Previously in the D&aacute;il the Taoiseach was asked questions on whether the European Court of Human Rights should be approached in light of the British authorities dragging their feet, to put it mildly, in giving information to help these investigations. Has the Taoiseach advanced that idea any further?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To repeat again, the McEntee commission reported on 11 January that various groups were prepared to communicate with it and assist it with information the commission believes they have. Mr. McEntee has assiduously followed up these issues. He believes it is worth engaging to try to obtain that information. The commission is following a definite line.</P>
        <P>Regarding the issues relating to the Garda and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the commission heard evidence from a significant number of persons within the jurisdiction. These persons also disclosed a variety of relevant documentation and information. In a number of instances, portions of the disclosed documentation contained sensitive information that would be privileged from disclosure in ordinary court proceedings. Where this situation arose, the commission generally succeeded in obtaining access to such documentation for the purpose of inspection and for the use of the investigation of all of the relevant portions of that information and documentation, taking into <Col N="40"/>account its sensitivity. We can take from that and from the report I am publishing today that Mr. McEntee has been able to obtain that data and information. He now seeks an extension to follow the remaining parts of the work.</P>
        <P>As for the European Court, the Attorney General has followed up that issue. As happened with the families, the courts considered the matter to be out of time. The Attorney General&rsquo;s view is that while we should not give up pressurising and campaigning on this issue, given that 30 years have passed, taking a similar case in similar circumstances would not yield much.</P>
        <P>In reply to Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question at the outset, we are now awaiting the final part of the report from Mr. Justice Barron, which will be available shortly. It deals with the bombs in Castleblayney, Dundalk and Dublin Airport as well as with the Silverbridge and Miami Showband attacks and will bring an end to the comprehensive examination of all the issues under investigation between late 1970 and 1976. It will be a comprehensive report on all aspects, in so far as all available documentation from within the State and all on which we were able to get our hands from outside the State are concerned. Some aspects, such as the Seamus Ludlow case are now before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights Sub-committee on the Barron Report while others have been dealt with by the sub-committee. The value of the process in which we have been engaged for the past few years is that we have put together the first comprehensive investigation of these matters. In the case of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, this has been done for the first time in 35 years. As I have stated repeatedly, we must always remember that one of the tragedies in this respect was that the Garda investigation of the Dublin and Monaghan bombing of May 1974 closed in August 1974. Hence, this is the first time we have had an entirely comprehensive examination of everything on which we could possibly physically put our hands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What costs have accrued to the McEntee inquiry? Does the Taoiseach have a final date for its completion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The date is 28 February. To date, the overall cost, as against what it would be if this was a tribunal, is &euro;925,000, with a projected total cost of approximately &euro;1.25 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach referred to Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s inquiry as being comprehensive. Does the Taoiseach agree that while Mr. Justice Barron has unquestionably pursued the issues diligently, it could hardly be described as being comprehensive, given the withholding of critical information by the British Government, as well as the failure to establish the whereabouts of critical files and documentation in this jurisdiction?</P><Col N="41"/>
        <P>In that light, can the Taoiseach tell the House whether the former Minister for Justice, Mr. Patrick Cooney, was asked to co-operate with the McEntee investigation and if so, has he co-operated? Has the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department also been asked to co-operate? Can he advise the House in this respect?</P>
        <P>Given the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response regarding the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion in the light of the experience of the Justice for the Forgotten group&rsquo;s European action, what other international action might he consider? Is there any avenue to address this matter through the United Nations?</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;9 million was provided for the remembrance fund set up in respect of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and all the other matters arising therefrom. Is the Taoiseach aware that this scheme, which was set up to assist people who were either injured or bereaved in the course of the conflict, is due to end in December 2006? Can he advise Members as to how much has been paid out from the remembrance fund? Does he agree that the promotion of the fund was extremely slow? I understand that the take-up has not been great, due to the lack of information and awareness. If the Taoiseach concurs with this view, given that we have entered the last 12 months of the fund&rsquo;s intended lifespan, will he now embark on a more proactive advertisement of the scheme, including the use of broadcast media, which would give all the salient information, so that deserving people may apply for and avail of the fund?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the points in reverse order. I will check what is the position regarding the fund. While it has been some time since I last checked, the fund was raised and highlighted in the House many times during its preparation and at its commencement. However, I will check the rate of take-up and if it requires an additional media profile, I will certainly arrange it, to ensure that the resources-&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach also check the other details?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. The resources were made available and are there for the use of the victims. We wish to use the fund for that purpose.</P>
        <P>My use of the word &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; was based on a comprehensive examination of all the data available to Mr. Justice Barron in this jurisdiction and that were available from the British authorities as a result of our efforts over several years. We know there were some shortcomings in that regard and as I noted, to use Mr. McEntee&rsquo;s own words, he has assiduously followed up this matter to try to acquire that further information.</P>
        <P>In so far as all of the data, information, documentation and interviewing of people are concerned, I am sure Mr. McEntee will give precise details as to who he has interviewed. In his <Col N="42"/>second report, which was published today, he states that he has interviewed a large number of people. I cannot answer as to whether he interviewed former Ministers for Justice. However, I assume he has gone back over what he has determined to be an appropriate range of people. I can confirm that he has engaged with senior officials within my Department.</P>
        <P>As I have stated, I have received advice from the Attorney General, as I promised both the joint committee and the Justice for the Forgotten group. He drew on the experience of a number of experts in the field of law in respect of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and efforts to go to the European Court with a successful case regarding the tragic events that happened more than three decades ago. The essence of his advice was that it would be extremely difficult for the Government to bring a successful case against the British Government in the European Court of Human Rights for the same reasons that were outlined in the judgment of the families who have already done this. I am aware that the Justice for the Forgotten group has failed to bring a successful case and I understand that the ruling went against it due to the lapse in time. That would also be a factor were we to try bringing a case. We are not in favour, nor is the Attorney General, of bringing a case we are not confident of winning. However, we will continue to explore every possible legal and political avenue open to us. In this regard, the Attorney General and his advisers are examining this matter. While I would rather not go into the details of the avenues being considered until they have been explored, we are looking at a number of ways in which we can follow this up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the PSNI has set up an historic inquiries unit in the North to look specifically at the unsolved crimes, bombs and horrendous acts which have occurred. Is the Government considering setting up an equivalent body within the Garda, so that it can work in tandem and in co-operation with the PSNI unit in Northern Ireland? As a result<?oasys _jy ?>of so doing, more documentation may come<?oasys _jy ?>to hand, because of the formalisation of procedures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are several thousand cases in Northern Ireland and the Ombudsman was anxious that relatives would be able to access whatever records and whatever examination of records would be there. It is proving to at least be useful in Northern Ireland. That is working and wherever there is a necessity we will co-operate. Of course there is our own inquiry, which Mr. Justice Smithwick has started, where we have given an undertaking to deal with them.</P>
        <P>Most of the cases that we have had have been investigated by Mr. Justice Barron, in any of the cases where people wanted to raise them. All of the ones of which I was aware have been dealt <Col N="43"/>with in the process of Mr. Justice Barron. If there were any outside of that, perhaps it would be useful that the Garda would investigate them. We used the process of the late Mr. Justice Hamilton first and then that of Mr. Justice Barron to examine these issues. Therefore, there would not be a need for that but I assure the Deputy that wherever there is a need for cross co-operation on any of these issues within the Garda, we could certainly provide for it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a point of order. This might be a good point to make it, at the beginning of the term. It is proposed to group 37 questions on significantly different subjects together. They involve two summits, trips abroad, visits to various countries, the discussions with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom etc. We cannot do business in this fashion where so diverse subjects are rolled into one set of answers, especially, as the Ceann Comhairle stated, where there will be no time in any event to pursue them by way of supplementary question. This entire tranche of questions will fall, after a period of absence from the House of some six weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s view. While it is not the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s doing, the division of these questions should be different. I suggest that we should not take these 37 questions here because there will not be time to ask supplementaries on any of them. If the Taoiseach agrees, we might leave these over until he next answers questions. It would be unsatisfactory to deal with India, rendition, the CAP, intergovernmental meetings and a range of other issues with so little time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sympathetic to the view Deputy Rabbitte expressed. It is incomprehensible how we can address these. Each of us has a series of questions that focus on different matters which the Taoiseach will now address in a lumped response.</P>
        <P>While it makes the project impossible, I wonder what is the alternative to hearing what he has to say. How does the Ceann Comhairle propose to set these aside and move on to the next tranche of questions, and what will be the story then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled many questions and I agree with the points made. For future reference, there should be a new method of grouping questions, for example, EU related questions could be grouped together and separate from more general international questions. Northern Ireland questions should be treated likewise. They all should be separate and that would make it much <Col N="44"/>more manageable and much more satisfactory from the point of view of Members attempting to elicit information from the Taoiseach.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I see the difficulty raised by the Opposition. I do not have a problem; I just take them as a group. Quite a number of these would just entail a report, but I could see that people would have questions on them and I cannot predetermine that. If I answer them, maybe Members could be allowed to resubmit the ones on which they want to ask question. I do not know. I have an open mind. It is a long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Is it possible that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response can be entered into the record and that he might hear the specific questions of Members because obviously we will only be able to ask about one or two? Is that an option?</P>

	<P>There are three proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 11 to 16, inclusive, agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I oppose the taking without debate of the motion to establish the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 was guillotined in the House last July and many issues such as the ombudsman commission were not adequately addressed. Many of us sought a single, Nuala O&rsquo;Loan-type ombudsman but we have ended up with an ombudsman commission. Under the Act, the commission must be recommended by the House and then appointed by the President. It is the wrong approach to take the House for granted in this case. I have no objection to the proposed appointees, as my objection is to the process. I am sure the individuals involved are all very worthy people but I am concerned about the method of their appointment. No advertisement was placed and there was no screening process. Even judges are recommended <Col N="48"/>by an advisory body but, in this case, names were pulled out of the blue by the Government and presented to the D&aacute;il and we are being asked to rubber stamp them. How were the requirements of the Act complied with before the names were presented to us? The Act requires that the persons appointed must have &ldquo;appropriate experience, qualifications, training or expertise&rdquo;. I have no idea whether these persons qualify under that provision. Once again, the Government is treating the Oireachtas as a rubber stamp. This is not the proper way to deal with this business and I object strongly to it. There should be a debate on the motion and related Garda issues such as the disciplinary regulations. A ludicrous scenario has emerged whereby the only penalties available under the regulations are the loss of one month&rsquo;s salary or dismissal. However, the motion should be debated, otherwise the House is being treated as an utter rubber stamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party also objects to the taking of this motion without debate. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 was rushed through the House at the end of the session last July and a significant number of amendments were not addressed. The proposed commission is covered by Parts 3 and 4. The legislation proposes that the commission should have an important function and that is underpinned by the President making appointments to it. The President does not normally make appointments to boards and so on. The Government has made nominations without placing an advertisement. No specification was drafted and we do not know what qualifications, experience, training or expertise were required of the appointees. We are being asked to nod the appointments through without a debate.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board, which was established in 1987, has been discredited &mdash; the Garda itself is the first to admit that &mdash; and that is why the commission was proposed. It is important, considering what has happened in recent years, that a proper mechanism should be implemented to give credibility to the examination of complaints about Garda activities. If the motion is rushed through, we will once again not have had the opportunity to properly assess the expertise of the appointees and the operation of the body involved. This is the first day of this session and we should begin properly by ensuring this important issue is debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party is opposed to No. 11, in particular, being taken without debate. The Government has shied away from the D&aacute;il for long enough and it wants to shy away from debating this issue. I take on board the points made by Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and Costello. However, we had debates on the appointments of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner and the Ombudsman for Children and they provided a useful opportunity for the public to have a say through their public representatives and for <Col N="49"/>the officeholders to get a sense of the way in which their offices are perceived and the expectation on their offices. It is remiss of the Government to seek to put through this proposal without debate, particularly given that the relevant legislation suggests and creates the expectation of a debate. This is a dangerous break from the precedent in this regard and it does no service to the persons to be appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Against the backdrop of the Minister&rsquo;s intent to railroad into being the Garda reserve, as he so describes it, to proceed without debate with the appointment of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission is inappropriate. There are many issues that require address in this matter. An opportunity in this House to address this and the other salient points is required. It is to the betterment of any matter that we address it in this Chamber rather than merely rubber-stamping it. To allow for the sharing of all perspectives and information and informing the wider public is surely part of the role and responsibility of this House. I oppose the taking of No. 11 without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission to investigate complaints against members of the force. Section 65 of the Act provides that the commission is to consist of three members, all of whom are to be appointed by the President following nomination by the Government and the passage of a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas recommending their appointment. One of the persons to be appointed is to be the chairperson.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, provisions regarding the process of appointment, the number of appointees and the manner of their operation is already set out in the legislation. We are concerned now with the names of the three individuals. On 13 December last, the Government nominated the following persons for appointment by the President to be members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission: Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh, chairperson, Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Conor Brady. It is necessary for the D&aacute;il and Seanad to recommend their appointment through a resolution. Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh is well known as a judge of the High <Col N="50"/>Court, Ms Foley is equally well known as the Director of Consumer Affairs, and Mr. Brady is a former editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>. The Minister did all he could to select three apolitical people who are suitable and have a range of experience in both judicial and administrative matters.</P>
      <P>If the House believes there should be a debate about the names &mdash; and that is the issue which will be discussed &mdash; it can take place tonight. We have already made the arrangements with the President to nominate the appointees, as required. However, if Members wish to discuss the suitability of these people and have a debate about them with the Minister and me, that is fine. However, we will not debate anything other than the three names. I have no objection if the Whips decide the House should sit late tonight to discuss the suitability of Mr. Justice Haugh, Ms Foley and Mr. Brady.</P>

	<P>On a point of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair&rsquo;s answer did not deal with the point of order I raised. This is not about there being a problem with Standing Orders but about there being a problem with a convention building up whereby omnibus motions are taken together which deal with a range of issues, and that impedes our work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a matter for the Chair; the House has already decided on this issue.</P>

	<P>Surely the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s role is to assist us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I ask the Deputy to allow the business of the House to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in the work we are entrusted by the people to carry out in this House. By having omnibus motions such as this, we are blocked from raising issues which are of public interest. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to ensure that such omnibus motions are not put forward which prevent us from raising points on an area such as health which is important to many of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the Deputy resumes her seat, the Chair will explain the position. A proposal grouping one or more items of business is in order as the proposed arrangements to be followed are more or less the same for all items to be taken without debate or identical speaking times. The items are voted on separately when put before the House after the Order of Business. It should be borne in mind that a proposal on the Order of Business is a narrow procedural motion making arrangements for the taking of business and nothing else. The proposal is a motion put forward by the Government and is in accordance with precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Implicit in this is that there would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;common ground between the various items to be taken under an omnibus motion but that is not the case here. Six different <Col N="55"/>items are being taken together. The debate is being stifled because of a procedural approach which is new. This was not the case in the past. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to assist Members of the House in the work we do and not to block debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>I wish to object to the taking of No. 18, statements on the European Council, on two grounds, one being the amount of time allocated to it. The 80 minutes allocated is inadequate given that we seldom get an opportunity to properly address current European and wider international interests. Since the last time we addressed European matters a number of developments have occurred that warrant full attention and address in this House. Unfortunately, the time allocated will not allow the full participation that Members would wish. I refer specifically to the so-called extraordinary rendition, kidnapping and the illegal detention of detainees in European countries by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the CIA and possibly other US agencies.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government and the cacophony that is echoing all around me might well examine their own position in relation to complicity in all of this regarding the continued use of Shannon Airport by the US Government, accommodated by our Government all too regrettably.</P>
      <P>I will move on to the second ground on which I object to the taking of this matter. If I had some order, it would make this project much easier for me. However, if I am not to have that, I would like to say that I object to the length of time allocated for this matter because of something that has been clearly omitted from the Order of Business and that should be before the D&aacute;il. I take this opportunity to commend Deputy Michael Higgins for having brought to public attention the issue of the secret treaties that have been entered <Col N="57"/>into by this Government with the US Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to speak on the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No, unfortunately, I will not. I object to the matter proceeding as outlined because this matter in relation to the guarantee to the US Government is contrary to Article 29 of the Constitution. Is there a level of noise around the House or is it that I cannot get a few moments of Members&rsquo; attention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy seems to have moved on to the statements on the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Article 29 of the Constitution is quite specific.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has been quite specific as to why he is opposing this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made my points on two counts. One is on the basis of Article 29 and the other is the omission of the opportunity to address a major transgression of responsibility by the Government relative to Article 29 of the Constitution and a succession of private and secret agreements entered into with the US Government and not unallied to the issues to be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the publication of the legislative programme by the Chief Whip for the forthcoming session. The Taoiseach will recall that on the priority list of legislation for the autumn session of 2005 there were 14 Bills and between November and December we repeatedly asked the Taoiseach when certain of these Bills would be published. The stock response was that they would be published before the House would resume today, before the commencement of the new session. Yet, on the new list produced by the Chief Whip five of the Bills are ones that were due to be published before the start of this session. In other words, they were to be published before yesterday. Does this mean the Taoiseach is being taken for a sucker in terms of his having repeatedly inquired as to when Bills would be published and being told they would be published before the House would commence? Five of the 14 Bills that were on the previous priority list for the autumn session of 2005 are on the new list. I also note that another Bill, the Foyle and Carlingford fisheries Bill has disappeared from the list. The Taoiseach might indicate the reason, within <Col N="58"/>the legislative production process, he was given repeated guarantees to the House that legislation would be published when those targets had not been achieved. He might also indicate where the Foyle and Carlingford fisheries Bill has gone.</P>
      <P>When is it proposed to fill the vacant seat across the House which was occupied until very recently by Deputy Callely? There is a vacancy within the Minister of State ranks. Perhaps the Taoiseach might take some people out of their anxiety by indicating when he will he intends to fill the vacancy.</P>

	<P>It is not possible to indicate when the Foyle and Carlingford fisheries Bill will be published. It is a joint project with the Northern Ireland authorities. Work has been completed on our side and we are awaiting the text from Northern Ireland. I cannot say at this stage when it will be ready. It will take some time.</P>
      <P>The other Bills to which Deputy Kenny referred should have been ready for this session. The information I gave the House indicated that the Bills would have completed the parliamentary drafting process and would be ready. If they have gone over time, it is because the drafting process has taken somewhat longer than should have been the case. The Chief Whip tries to ensure, as far as possible, that the information about the legislation he lists at the start of the session is true and that such legislation is published at least by the commencement of the next session.</P>

      <P>I also wish to ask the Taoiseach about the widespread wish among the public for the retention of Operation Freeflow for the remainder of the year.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask about promised legislation in the context of today&rsquo;s news that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has again decided to deport Mr. Olunkunle<?oasys _jy ?>Eluhanla. I note that the T&aacute;naiste, who represents the Palmerstown area of Dublin, is sitting beside the Minister at present. There is a need for a full and honest debate, not least about the reasons for the Minister&rsquo;s reversal of his decision of last year. It seems that the latest decision has been taken out of spite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question on legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Will the Taoiseach bring the proposed immigration and residence Bill to the House immediately so that we can debate Mr. Eluhanla&rsquo;s case in the context of proper immigration policy? It is important that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, should be convinced, by proper debate and argument in this House, that his reasons for deporting Mr. Eluhanla are erroneous and informed by nothing more than spite. Rather than ensuring that the students of Pobalscoil Iosolde take to the streets once again, we should debate this issue in a mature and responsible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss the legislation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that but this is breaking news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to allow the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise an issue that is not breaking news. The Taoiseach is aware that 15 of the 22 alleged abusers referred to in the Ferns Report accessed children through their work, either in boards of management or in schools. In that context, will he indicate when legislation establishing a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children will be considered in the House? Why is the excuse of the situation in Northern Ireland being used, given that extremely good legislation is in place in that jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Work on the Bill in question has concentrated on developing procedures for the vetting of convictions through the vetting unit. The development of a register gives rise to a range of legal, policy and practical implementation issues. The Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children are in discussions about the establishment of a pre-employment consultancy service. That is the current position in respect of this work. I do not have a date for the publication of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government intend to introduce a new Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 and to extend the relevant timeframe? I have received a letter from the T&aacute;naiste, stating that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised?</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Department of Health and Children informed the Department of Edu<Col N="62"/>cation and Science last April that it inspected the Regina Coeli hostel, of which the Morning Star Mother and Baby Home was a constituent part, which is where Ms Marie-Therese O&rsquo;Loughlin was born and spent the first few years of her life. People on all sides of the House were consistently told that the hostel could not be included because it had not been inspected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow the Taoiseach to answer the question.</P>

We have now been told that we will have to wait up to the beginning of the next session before the legislation is published. Will the Taoiseach give the House a commitment that the Bill will actually be enacted before Easter, rather than just appearing on the legislative programme, so that those people who have been denied the reimbursement of the moneys taken from them can look forward, at least, to repayments happening within that timeframe?</P>

	<P>At the close of the last session the Taoiseach, in response to a question from me, indicated the energy (miscellaneous provisions) <Col N="66"/>Bill would be brought before the House before the end of the last session. While he meant it and said it sincerely it never appeared. Why did it not come before the House? When will it come before the House? Along with that, another alarming detail is the fact that a number of Bills have disappeared altogether. For example, the natural gas Bill and the Bord G&aacute;is Bill have disappeared. What was the reason for removing them from the agenda? Did something happen that we do not know about? Is there no gas over there and can it not be generated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand from the Minister, with whom I spoke today, that he hopes to bring forward the roads (miscellaneous provisions) Bill as soon as possible this session. There are some matters he has to finalise but he hopes to bring it forward this session. It is not on the list.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2005 which is listed as one of a number of Bills before select, special or joint committees. This Bill deals with unfinished housing estates and was referred to committee last March. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is blocking the committee from dealing with it. What is the Government&rsquo;s intention in regard to this Bill? Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to <Col N="68"/>block this Bill or will it facilitate it being dealt with by the committee?</P>

    <Title>Personal Explanation by Minister.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance has given notice in writing that he wishes to make a personal explanation and I have decided to permit this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies will recall that the Appropriation Act, which was enacted before Christmas, contains provisions relating to the carryover of &euro;345.7 million capital spending from 2005 to 2006. The Seanad is due to hear statements on this Act tomorrow, in accordance with an agreement that a discussion would take place after the recess. As the D&aacute;il has the primary role in financial matters and as I will be referring to a particular matter in the Seanad, I wish to draw attention to that matter now because it may affect the envisaged scale of the carryover.</P>
      <P>My Department was advised late in the evening of Tuesday, 17 January 2006, by the Department of Health and Children, that the Health Service Executive had advised it on that day that there may be some alterations to its estimated outturn and, consequently, to its capital carryover figure of &euro;56.4 million, included in the Appropriation Act 2005. The Act provided that, in regard to the HSE, a sum of &euro;56.4 million could be made available for spending in 2006 in respect of capital not disbursed in 2005. My Department has been advised by the Department of Health and Children that, on the basis of the preliminary outturn figures for 2005 from the HSE, the capital savings anticipated by the executive in December may have been used to meet similar sized costs under the current expenditure heading. The Department of Health and Children is awaiting final verification of the outturn from the HSE.</P>
      <P>The implications of this development for the 2006 capital budget for the HSE will be reviewed in the context of the Revised Estimates Volume 2006. I am determined to ensure that it will not have an adverse impact on the plans for the HSE&rsquo;s capital spending in 2006. As matters stand, the 2006 capital allocation for the HSE is &euro;558 million, an increase of 10% on the provisional 2005 outturn.</P>
      <P>The legal instrument that gives effect to the carryover of funds from 2005 to 2006 and which determines the actual amounts to be carried forward is a ministerial order. Under the relevant legislation, section 91 of the Finance Act 2004, the order must be made before the end of March and the draft order will be formally put before the House for approval by resolution. The Revised Estimates Volume will also include <Col N="70"/>details of the carryover under each Vote and, accordingly, I will be advising the House in due course in compliance with the legal requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I thank the Minister for the courtesy of informing the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It should just be a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that the change in the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s Estimates, where it is reducing its approved capital spend and increasing its approved current spend, would need retrospective approval by the House? While the Minister&rsquo;s personal statement and his changes by order in respect of the carryover for capital spending is fine, it appears that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children would have to obtain approval from the Houses for the way she has changed her Estimates.</P>
      <P>If that is the case, will we be seeing a presentation from the Minister to clarify what has happened? It seems quite extraordinary that money voted for capital purposes would without notice to anybody be spent on current purposes. As this is a point of order, I will not go into what that suggests about the way the Department is administering its money. I would like clarification of this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There cannot be a debate or discussion on the matter. Deputy Burton may speak on a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it be in order to provide time to debate this issue? This is a major error in the accounts of the Department of Health and Children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and of the new Accounting Officer. In the course of the budgetary process, we were given figures that indicated a total capital carryover for the Government of &euro;285 million under the capital carryover rules. Before the end of the year, that had increased to &euro;343 million. I asked the Department about this vast increase. We are now told there is a further error in the Estimates of &euro;56 million, which was wrongly classified as capital carryover when, in fact, it was spent on current account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be another opportunity to debate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This may well throw light on the freedom of information disclosures before Christmas of the correspondence from Professor Drumm about his inability to spend more current <Col N="71"/>account money in regard to staff in the Health Service Executive. This requires a major statement of explanation. It is not good enough for the Minister to leave it until the end of February, when the Revised Estimates for expenditure will be produced. The Minister must account to the House under the budgetary process for this major and unprecedented error. I remind him that my colleague, Deputy McManus, queried whether or not the head of the HSE should immediately become Accounting Officer because of the confusion that is ongoing in regard to health expenditure in this country. We deserve to be able to debate this matter.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for providing this information to the House but it is deeply inadequate. It is a major error to confuse current and capital spending on health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving the up-to-date information, as provided to me and as I would normally do. As the Appropriation Act will be discussed in the Seanad tomorrow and as I will refer to this matter there, I wished to put it on the record in the House this evening as the money-raising powers of the Oireachtas are vested in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>Second, the matter can be referred to in regard to the Revised Estimates Volume. The question of verification between the Department of Health and Children and the HSE is taking place. We have a provisional outturn figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Do we know on what the money was spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The third point is that I am addressing the House on this matter because the Appropriation Act shows a figure of &euro;56.4 million which, as I was informed on Tuesday last by the Department of Health and Children, will not now be available. That is my role in regard to ensuring that the Appropriation Act reference is made and that the fullest amount of information will be available for the debate in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On what was the &euro;56.4 million spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On current purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>What is the point of order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Even if we are not in a position to clarify the matter at present, it seems that the House deserves more than a statement of clarification from the Minister in respect of his remit because it appears that the Minister for Health and Children has spent money on subheads that the D&aacute;il did not sanction. We need to know what the procedure is and perhaps that can be done <Col N="72"/>tomorrow. It does not appear that this can be passed off with a personal statement to which there is no opportunity to respond or which cannot be scrutinised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We now proceed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the authority of the T&aacute;naiste to spend money depends on the Votes of this House. She has her current spending wrong through the executive of the HSE by &euro;56 million and she has her capital spending wrong by another &euro;56 million so the cumulative error is over &euro;100 million. Information was published under freedom of information legislation regarding problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>European Council Meeting: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I attended the European Council in Brussels on 15 and 16 December 2005, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. The conclusions of the Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>This European Council came at a critical time for the European Union. The rejection of the European Constitution in the French and Dutch referendums, and the failure to reach agreement on the financial perspectives at the June European Council, were blows to the confidence of the European Union. The agreement on the main item on the agenda, the future financial perspectives for the European Union for the seven years 2007 to 2013 was, therefore, a very welcome development. The agreement owes much to the political leadership and courage of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. In the best spirit of the EU, a compromise was reached which both protects the vital national interests of each member state and at the same time allows the enlarged EU to move forward on a sound financial basis.</P>
      <P>The agreement provides for &euro;862 billion in commitment appropriations for the years 2007 to 2013, a very significant sum. I would have preferred to see a larger overall amount but welcomed the eventual compromise as this went <Col N="75"/>beyond the proposal which was on the table at the outset of the December Council.</P>
      <P>Throughout the negotiations, we had a number of clear key national objectives. First, the issue of future CAP funding was central to our interests. I wanted to ensure the European Council fully honoured its October 2002 agreement on future CAP funding. This objective was achieved. Any other result would have called into question the credibility of decisions taken at the highest level in the EU. This was a matter of principle for me.</P>
      <P>Overall, over the seven years 2007 to 2013, Ireland is expected to receive &euro;10.4 billion in CAP payments and market supports. The commitments we made to our farmers in October 2002 about the level of future financial support will be honoured in full. The overall amount provided for in this heading of the financial perspectives will also cover future CAP payments to Bulgaria and Romania. In this context, the European Commission, at my request, has given a written declaration that the level of direct payments to farmers envisaged in the October 2002 agreement and the 2003 CAP reform programme will be respected.</P>
      <P>Over the course of the negotiations I also worked to obtain a good outcome on EU support for rural development. As a result, the amount available to Ireland under this heading is substantially greater than the British Presidency&rsquo;s proposal at the outset of the European Council. Ireland will receive its allocation of EU rural development funds on the same basis as the other 14 original member states with a special additional allocation for Ireland of &euro;500 million.</P>
      <P>While the precise details remain to be finalised by the Commission, it is expected that our receipts under rural development should be in the region of &euro;1.9 billion. This will ensure our rural communities will continue to receive EU aid as they modernise and adapt to the reformed CAP. Second, we consistently supported generous structural and cohesion funding for the new member states. This has been achieved. Over the next seven years, the new member states will absorb over 50% of all cohesion funding. In financial terms, they will receive around &euro;174 billion to support them in their efforts to bring their living standards up to the average EU level. This is a seven-fold increase on their current level of EU support.</P>
      <P>The new member states now have the best opportunity in generations to revitalise their economies through high growth and sustained economic development. The flow of EU structural and cohesion funding will ensure they become increasingly important markets for Irish goods and services over the next decade.</P>
      <P>As far as Ireland is concerned, the Government accepted that our increased prosperity meant that we were no longer eligible to receive EU structural and cohesion funding on the scale that we had in the past. However, I was determined to <Col N="76"/>ensure adequate cohesion arrangements for our regions in transition. On the basis of the December agreement, we will receive some &euro;800 million in structural funding up to 2013. This money will be spent in the BMW and south-east regions in accordance with the EU rules for regional development funding.</P>
      <P>The financial perspectives also include a further strong pledge of support by the EU to the peace process through an allocation of a further &euro;200 million for the continuation of the EU&rsquo;s PEACE programme. In addition, the conclusions of the European Council include a provision on the International Fund for Ireland. This requests the Commission to take the steps necessary to continue EU support for the fund as it enters the crucial final phase of its work up to 2010. Taken together, these commitments are an indication of the continuing solidarity of our EU partners and the European Commission in the efforts of the two governments to promote peace and reconciliation. The commitments made by our partners will be particularly welcomed in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>Third, we strongly believe that the costs of enlargement must be fairly shared between the member states. From the outset, this was one of the most difficult issues to resolve and required a significant level of compromise. I am pleased the European Council finally succeeded in reaching agreement on the British rebate. The agreement provides that from 2013, at the latest, Britain will fully participate in the financing of enlargement costs for countries that acceded to the EU after April 2004, except for CAP market expenditure. In order to achieve this, Britain&rsquo;s budget rebate will be adjusted through a progressive annual reduction. Over the period 2007 to 2013, Britain will therefore forego a maximum of &euro;10.5 billion of its rebate.</P>
      <P>The overall effect of this agreement means the British rebate will remain on all expenditure in the EU 15 and on all CAP expenditure in the EU of 25 or 27 countries. However, the EU will avoid the absurd situation in which Britain would have been substantially shielded from most of the costs of enlargement and the poorer new member states would have ended up contributing to a steep rise in the British rebate.</P>
      <P>I was also determined to ensure that any agreement reached in the negotiations would last for the full seven years. We were always willing to have a review mechanism in the financial perspectives agreement but only on condition that any outcome need not take effect until after 2013. The agreement includes a review clause under which the Commission has been invited to report in 2008-09 on both the expenditure and revenue sides of the budget. Unanimity will be required for any decisions taken under this review. As far as I am concerned, the review will not in any way prejudice our CAP funding up to 2013.</P>
      <P>In addition to CAP, rural development and cohesion funding, the financial perspectives also <Col N="77"/>include other elements which, at constant 2004 prices, are of significant importance to Ireland. EU spending on competitiveness, growth and employment will increase by almost 65% between 2007 and 2013 with a refocusing of expenditure on support for the Lisbon Agenda. The European Council also agreed to establish a globalisation adjustment fund designed to assist workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns. The maximum amount of expenditure through the fund will be &euro;500 million per year. The EU will greatly strengthen its engagement in the fight against terrorism, drugs and in dealing with illegal immigration through a 167% increase in spending under the freedom, security and justice heading.</P>
      <P>From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective the overall result was excellent. We expect that over the seven years covered by the perspectives, our receipts will amount to &euro;14 billion while our contributions are expected to be &euro;13 billion, leaving us with a net gain of &euro;1 billion. We anticipate that notwithstanding our economic success and our increased national prosperity, we are likely to become a net contributor to the EU budget only near the end of the seven-year period.</P>
      <P>In addition to reaching agreement on the financial perspectives, the European Council adopted important conclusions on other issues. It decided to grant candidate status to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In taking this decision, the European Council made clear that further steps would have to be considered in the light of the debate on the EU&rsquo;s enlargement strategy. Immediately before the European Council, Foreign Ministers agreed that it was necessary to have a further discussion on enlargement strategy in 2006. Such a debate is useful and necessary at this stage. The views of our citizens need to be taken into account in this debate and we also have to pay particular attention to the absorption capacity of the European Union. In our discussions and negotiations with candidate and other countries who aspire to eventual membership, the EU needs to ensure, in a fair and rigorous way, that the conditions laid down for membership are fully met. At the same time it is necessary for us to give encouragement to the candidate countries, and to all the countries of the western Balkans, by reconfirming their European perspective. Membership of the European Union must remain open to those European states that meet the criteria for membership.</P>
      <P>The European Council also adopted a new strategic partnership between the EU and Africa, a new global approach to migration with a focus on Africa and the Mediterranean and an EU counter-terrorism strategy.</P>
      <P>On the external relations side, the European Council adopted a comprehensive declaration on the situation in the Middle East. There have been significant developments in the region since our meeting. I know the House will join me in sending our best wishes for the recovery of the Israeli <Col N="78"/>Prime Minister, Mr. Sharon. I have communicated to the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Olmert, and to our Palestinian friends that we and our partners in the EU will continue to give our strong support to political leaders on both sides who have the courage to take the difficult decisions needed for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</P>
      <P>I welcome the determination of the Palestinian Authority and of President Abbas in particular in proceeding with the democratic legislative elections, which are being held today. In Israel, campaigning is already under way for the elections at the end of March. In these circumstances, it is important that the EU has made clear that it remains firmly committed to working with the parties in the search for a viable, two-state solution, based on the principles and the practical steps outlined in the Quartet roadmap.</P>
      <P>On Iran, the European Council strongly condemned the calls by the Iranian President for the eradication of Israel and his denial of the Holocaust. The declaration also underlined the grave concern of the EU at Iran&rsquo;s failure to build the necessary confidence that its intentions in developing its nuclear programme are exclusively peaceful. Regrettably, in recent weeks Iran has taken further steps to resume sensitive activities, which had been suspended. It has failed to co-operate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has now breached all the previously agreed conditions on the basis of which the EU has sought to negotiate with it. An emergency meeting of the IAEA board of governors will take place on 2 February and it seems likely it will be forced to decide to report the issue to the UN Security Council.</P>
      <P>The European Union remains committed to a diplomatic solution, in which the IAEA should play a central role. We are fully open to a resumption of dialogue, provided Iran gives real grounds for believing that it is sincere. We all want to avoid an escalation of the situation and we believe that the international community should remain united in its approach. However, Iran should not underestimate the gravity of the concern with which its actions are viewed by the European Union and by the wider international community.</P>
      <P>This was a very successful European Council and a fitting end to the British Presidency. For our part, we have ensured that our farmers can plan for the future with the certainty that their direct payments under the CAP are secure up to 2013 and that the European Union will continue to be a strong supporter of rural development.</P>
      <P>In the broader EU picture, the successful conclusion of the negotiations shows that the EU of 25 is capable of making the difficult compromises necessary for the EU to function and to develop. With this major negotiation now out of the way, we can focus our energies on promoting economic growth and development in the EU, taking advantage of the opportunities of globalisation, <Col N="79"/>tackling the challenge of securing Europe&rsquo;s energy supplies, fighting crime and terrorism and making Europe relevant to the citizen.</P>
      <P>The message from this European Council is clear. The European Union continues to work for Europe and its member states. Ireland continues to benefit at every level from membership of the European Union. When faced with seemingly intractable problems, the Europe of today is able to tackle them through collective common action rather than, as in the past, falling into division and conflict. This is a cause for great optimism into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Last December, depending on whom one spoke to, the European Union summit was predicted to be a blame game or a waiting game. As politicians, we have become used to summits teetering on the brink of collapse before last minute adjustments. However, for months before the December summit, in fact since the failure at Luxembourg, for many politicians and commentators collapse seemed inevitable. The only uncertainty seemed to be whether Britain or France would be to blame. Anglo-French tensions simmered since the Iraq war. The British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, was tough in demanding reform. President Chirac&rsquo;s pre-summit warning was ominous when he said, &ldquo;Britain has a difficult mission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the end, through a last-ditch compromise by Mr. Blair and Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s becoming mediator, a surprise agreement was achieved, even if attempts to finalise the financial perspectives, better known as the budget, were tedious and tension filled. However, it was never going to be easy to thrash out an agreeable deal to pay for enlargement while at the same time mourning the defeat of the constitution.</P>
      <P>I commend the role played by my EPP colleague, Chancellor Angela Merkel. While after 30 hours of marathon negotiations, Britain was ready to compromise, in the end, her role as honest broker sealed the deal. It was expected that she would have a defining role in the process. As the newly appointed and very influential leader of one of the strongest countries in Europe and in the world, her intervention was important.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach outlined, the budget talks revealed several underlying tensions, not least with the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s initial plans regarding the reduction of the British discount in exchange for cuts in EU farm subsidies being correctly bitterly resisted by France and the new member states from eastern Europe. With a view pertaining that a Union that could not manage to agree its budget would not have much of a chance of agreeing on anything else, it was critical that we reached consensus on this matter. Agreeing the medium-term budget for the Union has sent out a positive signal and not before time. It sent out the message that after months of gridlock and <Col N="80"/>angst after the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in founder-member states, Europe can agree and can take action.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the budget for 2007-13 were launched during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU in 2004. The budget, at more than &euro;862 billion, will be limited to 1.045% of EU economic output or Union gross national income over the seven years under headings such as cohesion, with &euro;307 billion; CAP direct payments and market support, with &euro;293 billion; and rural development, with &euro;70 billion. The initially contentious British rebate will be reduced by &euro;10.5 billion in CAP payments while the Government here estimates that Ireland will receive &euro;10 billion in CAP payments over the same seven-year period. There will be rural development funding of &euro;1.9 billion. That is a significant figure and the money should not be wasted. Some visionary planning on how it is to be spent is required.</P>
      <P>I repeat my earlier statements that the Government should not agree any premature review of the CAP. Irish farmers have engaged in a serious review of the CAP already and payments have been reduced. The current level of CAP support should continue to 2013 as agreed. Any moves to reduce CAP payments before that time should be strenuously resisted. I am glad the Taoiseach referred to a Commission direction in writing on that matter. If we want to maintain and expand public support for the European Union, such agreements must be honoured.</P>
      <P>In 2008 and 2009, a review of spending on all aspects of the EU budget will take place. However, the outcome of that review will not take effect until 2013 unless the European Council, acting unanimously, decides otherwise. However, while we are pleased with our budget compromise that established a financial framework for the Union for the medium term, we should remember that this compromise does not yet represent a major breakthrough in efforts to establish sustainable budget structures in the longer term. In many ways, our compromise maintains the existing spending structures, with their focus, for now, on agricultural spending. However, at the same time, crucially, we are making a start on the reform of the future structures of spending &mdash; the accountability factor of which should help bring Europe closer to the people &mdash; with greater priority being given, in future, to spending on innovation and promoting growth.</P>
      <P>Right now, our budget is relatively small at approximately 1% of gross national income. To restore competitiveness against others on the Continent, we need to concentrate on making the best use of it in the longer term, not just in agriculture but also in innovation, education and research.</P>
      <P>I visited the Tyndall Institute in UCC last week. The Taoiseach may also have had occasion to do so. It is fascinating to hear how academics and researchers plot out the future for the next ten to 15 years, be it in the area of silicon development, semiconductors, mass communi<Col N="81"/>cations, high speed communication effectiveness or whatever. The development of nanotechnology, what it means and what it can mean in practice, is the way of the future from an innovation perspective. The country can be proud of that type of institute.</P>
      <P>We must remember that western Europe currently accounts for 30% of global GDP and Asia, excluding Japan, accounts for just 13%. The next 20 years will see a serious correction or rebalance, where these two will be expected to converge at some point. As the House will be aware, India produces 3 million graduates per year. If Europe is to compete at the high end, we must examine investing in innovation, growth opportunities and, crucially, education. This is recognised in every country and across all parties but giving practical effect to it is the challenge.</P>
      <P>While the budget was the major work and outcome of the December summit, discussion was undertaken and some progress made in a number of other key areas, such as the threat of terror and the formulating of a comprehensive and proportionate response. The summit also noted progress in developing both medium and long-term strategies to deal with climate change and the search for sustainable sources of energy. In that context, the recent stand-off between Russia and the Ukraine brought the issue of energy security home to everyone. Gas currently accounts for a quarter of our national energy use but, unlike any other of the vast majority of our EU neighbours, which store on average approximately 14% of their annual requirements, Ireland has no strategic gas reserve. Given that energy is increasingly becoming a matter of global geopolitics, I strongly urge the Government to establish a strategic gas reserve as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I encourage the Government to work hard in the establishment of a single energy market in the EU. Currently, there are 25 separate energy markets in the Union, whereas the United States has one. It is time Europe looked to creating a single, stable energy market, which would include harmonisation of pipelines. We may have escaped damage in the recent stand-off in eastern Europe but had it continued for political or other reasons, we would certainly have been affected in time with a loss of competition through higher costs when prices would have risen. This would have been inevitable.</P>
      <P>At some of the European debates, there should also be a real focus in terms of where we will proceed in energy and what is the European perspective across all of the borders and countries regarding the existing potential for the development of sustainable energy supply in part, at least, through wind energy.</P>
      <P>Also highlighted at the summit was enlargement and its effects. Under our Presidency less than two years ago, the European Union experienced the single greatest enlargement in its history when ten new members joined on 1 May 2004. There is no doubt that this accession has <Col N="82"/>been beneficial to the Union but it has brought a number of challenges to member states, including Ireland. As we discuss enlargement and its consequences, Ireland must always bear in mind that, for generations, our people went overseas to seek a better life for themselves and their families. That is why many people in all walks of life and sectors of the economy &mdash; to the highest levels of politics &mdash; in the United States have Irish roots.</P>
      <P>Ireland has benefited significantly from the arrival of workers from the new EU countries but their arrival has also brought concerns, as highlighted by Deputy Rabbitte, about possible displacement of workers, standards of worker protection and workers&rsquo; rights. These are concerns and challenges that need rational debate, particularly here. Those challenges and people&rsquo;s consequent sense of unease are primarily due to one issue, namely, lack of planning. By this I mean real planning, namely, planning for the future of the country as opposed to that relating to the short term.</P>
      <P>Last year Ireland received 82,000 new immigrants, which is the equivalent of adding the entire population of County Kilkenny in one year. We now have the equivalent, as it were, of 27 counties depending on the hospital services, the classrooms, the buses and the policing and general Garda presence that were already incapable, in many ways and instances, of providing for the needs of 26 counties. It is no wonder people express concerns and anxieties about the effect on our society. They see a squeeze on the services, which is not the migrants&rsquo; fault. It is the fault of the Government, which failed to plan and provide capacity. By refusing to plan for our new and changed society, the Government has left many people competing for services, most critically in the areas of health, education, transport and so on.</P>
      <P>On the future of enlargement, its speed and scope, we are now in a period where the Union could focus on this time of deliberation. Negotiations with Croatia have already begun, while no commencement date for talks with Macedonia has been agreed. With the future accession of Turkey &mdash; whenever that happens, perhaps in 20 years&rsquo; time &mdash; for the first time ever the EU will have a border with the Middle East. With public questions over the constitution &mdash; a constitution that is good for Ireland and Europe &mdash; we would do well to take the time to consider our direction and the speed at which we are proceeding in this matter. Part of that thought must be in devising ways to connect people to the idea of Europe, to communicate to people the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of the European Union.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the constitution proposal addressed the residual feelings of many of our citizens that the Union is remote and its decision-making not fully accountable. For example, the constitution proposes that member state parliaments would have six weeks prior notice of any legislation coming from Brussels <Col N="83"/>and, therefore, would have a role in either blocking or adhering to the various measures contained therein. In addition, the Commission would undertake an impact study on its proposals before sending them to the 25 national parliaments for their approval. In these ways, the elected national representatives would have a greater say in the possible impact of European legislation. This is an important measure as it would strengthen the role of national parliaments in the EU&rsquo;s legislative process.</P>
      <P>The reforms foreseen in the constitution must be implemented. A number could be introduced now, without treaty change or ratification of the constitution, through inter-institutional agreement or by revising rules of procedure, for example, the transparency of law-making in the Council and more rigorous scrutiny by each national parliament of its government&rsquo;s management of EU affairs.</P>
      <P>I welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s decision last week to commit &euro;80 million to the international fund necessary to avert a global pandemic of bird flu. If the global community had acted with alacrity last year, we could have saved ourselves costs and lives, with the list of affected countries being considerably smaller. It is now up to the global community, including the EU, to do its bit to see that desperately poor economies such as Vietnam can tackle the virus in its flocks as effectively as a moderately wealth country, such as Thailand, which has done so with first class surveillance and veterinary services. This can never be achieved by poor countries.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Compared to expectations, the December summit was a relative success and I commend Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s involvement in that. The Austrian Government has taken over the Presidency and<?oasys _jy ?>I look forward to debating its proposals with<?oasys _jy ?>Chancellor Sch&uuml;ssel in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The most important item agreed at the recent summit was the budget or the financial perspectives from 2007-13. Apart from that decision, the overall Presidency could scarcely be described as visionary or exciting. The references in the conclusions to the future of Europe suggest no sense of urgency in tackling the political and institutional issues that arise from the rejection of the proposed treaty on the EU in a number of states.</P>
      <P>Apart from the important matter of settling the budget, there is a sense of a Union that is marking time on some of the major issues. The financial perspectives, an inter-institutional agreement between Parliament, Council and the Commission on the main budgetary priorities, sets the framework for Union expenditure over those years. It is a critical component of the EU structure and includes areas such as funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, improving competitiveness, research and development, and cohesion between the regions. I welcome the commitment <Col N="84"/>to observe the earlier agreement in respect of the CAP.</P>
      <P>We should not evaluate the budget as an elaborate technical exercise of balancing the books on a European scale. Far more importantly, the financial perspectives for 2007-13 are the outcome of a series of explicit and implicit political choices and trade-offs, made by governments and influenced by the Commission, member states, the Parliament and the incumbent British Presidency. The Barroso Commission seems to be finding its feet and finding a balance between two different views of the way forward. President Barroso and his colleagues must address the practical problem of efficiently managing the interaction of a Commission of 25 members. For Ireland, a far more important issue is where the balance of power in the Commission will settle. It is between Commissioners who favour the defence and enhancement of the European social model and those who favour a return to unbridled market economics. There is no doubt the character and political orientation of the Commission and of the EU has changed. There is no doubt the disaffection of many European citizens is directly related to that change. The priority that used to attach to enhanced social cohesion and protection is no longer always evident.</P>
      <P>Let us recall that Jacques Delors offered the European trade union confederation and affiliated national trade unions a deal. The core of that deal was that, in exchange for trade union support for the establishment of the Internal Market, the trade unions would get a strong social dimension, including social dialogue, social policy, health and safety policy, or to summarise, a well-balanced approach taking into account the social impact of the Internal Market legislation. There is now a strong feeling that some supporters of the services directive, for example, are attempting to undermine that balance.</P>
      <P>All of us, not least the Government, underestimated the challenges and the scale, by comparison with the United Kingdom, of workers from new member states coming to work in Ireland and greatly benefiting our economy, as referred to by Deputy Kenny. Because our economy has been able to accommodate larger migrant inflows than was predicted, the process has not been accompanied by regulation, monitoring or invigilation of labour standards. The policy of zero-level regulation and minimal enforcement invites difficulty. Displacement is not a figment of the imagination of trade unions and exploitation is the other side of the displacement coin.</P>
      <P>These facts of modern Irish life cannot be dismissed as merely anecdotal evidence. There is nothing anecdotal about the cases of Irish Ferries and Gama and several more minor, less well-known but no less serious cases. The Government&rsquo;s attitude is to let the market rip. If the macro figures are okay, it turns a blind eye to abuses and dangers.</P><Col N="85"/>
      <P>There is nothing anecdotal about the Laval case in Sweden, now referred to the European Court of Justice. Commenting on the Laval case, the party of European socialists observed:</P>
      <P LI="1">Some media in Europe have described this case as an example of protectionist or even xenophobic trade union action. The fact is exactly the opposite. The trade union movement in Sweden is fighting for nondiscrimination: workers in Sweden should have the same conditions regardless of their nationality and there should be fair competition among companies.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have been making the same point here and I agree with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, when he told my colleague Deputy Broughan that he viewed:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">with great concern the potential social implications of the displacement of workers on established conditions in favour of those willing to do the same jobs on much poorer conditions... We do not want to see people building competitive advantage based on poor wages, casualisation of labour, low health and safety standards or other compliance practices.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister referred to a recent development, not just confined to Ireland, whereby workers from Eastern Europe are being recruited on the basis of a contract for services, that is, on a self employed basis. In such circumstances, Irish legislation protecting employees would not apply.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister and I regret neither Deputy Martin nor this Government have taken any steps to address the difficulties highlighted. Until now the Government has been nodding assent to the services directive which, if approved as originally drafted, will seriously exacerbate the phenomenon I have highlighted.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 21 of the Brussels Conclusions the Council looks forward to receiving an amended proposal on the draft services directive from the Commission. The Parliament is due to have its first reading of the draft directive in mid-February and is scheduled to vote on the Gephardt report to the Parliament on 16 February. Speaking in January at a press conference at the start of the current Austrian Presidency, President Barroso said that very soon after the Parliament&rsquo;s vote the Commission will publish a revised proposal as requested by the European Council last December.</P>
      <P>I welcome President Barroso&rsquo;s commitment that the Commission, along with the Parliament and the Council, hope to come up with what he called a balanced solution. From reports of that press conference I understand the President repeated the term &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; several times. He said he wanted a proposal that would provide what he called &ldquo;value-added&rdquo; but which must also take into account the concerns of certain sectors and of certain member states more than others. I <Col N="86"/>ought to have said that I propose to share time with Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.</P>
      <P>Like our sister parties across Europe, the Labour Party is especially concerned about the country of origin principle. The so-called country of origin principle is not a principle at all. It is a shortcut to liberalise markets that is advocated by interests who do not believe in common standards or raising standards to a universally accepted minimum. The country of origin principle boils down to the idea that if something is good enough for where I come from, then it is good enough for another country too. If that approach was applied across the board, there would be no common protection laws for consumer goods, no common entitlement to equal pay for women and no European environmental laws. The Labour Party believes in freedom to provide services across European frontiers. However, it must be in accordance with common and agreed future standards rather than tolerating the existing worst standard in whatever member state as an acceptable minimum for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>In support of what my party leader just said, I draw the attention of the House to the following points I wish to make, which come within the context of the agreed budget. I ask the Taoiseach and his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whether they could address their minds to them. We have certainty until 2013, which is not far away. I am glad the Taoiseach stated on more that one occasion that it is one matter to review expenditure between now and 2013 but that it is quite another to suggest that it would change mid-stream. The Labour Party would fully support any Irish Government on that position. The action taken by the British Presidency in that regard was foolhardy and brought down upon the Presidency unnecessary pressure from which it had to escape.</P>
      <P>There are two elephants in the room regarding our position. The first is Europe&rsquo;s extraordinary fragility regarding independent energy supply, as was witnessed in the Ukraine and Georgia. We are now effectively a gas importer and are more dependent on external gas for our energy supplies than was the case 15 or 20 years ago. The fragility of that supply is highlighted in recent history. I refer here to the Yom Kippur war of 1973 and the oil crisis emanating out of Iran in 1979. The lessons of history are still memory for many of us, as is the havoc wreaked in the Irish economy at the time. I still recall the effect on the building industry. We are now doubly dependent on our construction industry and our exposure is all the more acute.</P>
      <P>We must start planning for a proper energy policy at both European and national level. There is no contradiction here. I ask the Taoiseach, in his discussions with the Cabinet, to invite the Minister for Finance to re-examine financial incentives to fast track and improve sustainable energy creation in Ireland. The Taoiseach is <Col N="87"/>aware of the current stalemate. Nothing is happening with regard to wind energy, which is one of the few areas where we could have significant energy capacity. That must be dealt with against the background of the uncertainty I described.</P>
      <P>The second matter I wish to raise is the sustainability of rural Ireland. The Common Agricultural Policy is coming to an end in real terms, relative to what it was back in 1973 when we joined the European Union. The face of rural Ireland will be utterly and totally transformed. We already had a insight into what will happen to agriculture with the Agri-Vision report and the Foresight report, which was recently referred to in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>Instead of trying to get the best compensation deal for the 3,500 or 3,800 tillage farmers in this country so they would be permanently off the land, we should examine how we can take their expertise and tradition from the 80 year old beet growing industry and see in what way can that land and those skills be used to start to grow the biomass that would be a part, albeit small, of sustainable energy. What will we do with Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s landmass? In another 15 years, which is as far in the future as 1991 is in the past &mdash; the Taoiseach and I remember quite clearly what we did in 1991 &mdash; we will have a landmass the size of the Minister for Foreign Affair&rsquo;s constituency county of Louth in public ownership, drained, cleared and available for the type of prairie production of biomass on a scale that rural Ireland has never before seen. If we do not start considering these issues now, against the background of certainty that the budget deal created for the CIP, future generations will hold us to account and state that we wasted a golden opportunity of high prosperity in Ireland to give us a measure of sustainability and energy independence which we do not have at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The major question which still must be addressed &mdash; this will be done in Salzburg at the Sound of Europe conference &mdash; is where to now with the constitution for Europe. Last week in Berlin Mr. de Villepin addressed the Humboldt University and outlined how France was progressing with the constitution. His statements are interesting in the context of what Deputy Rabbitte stated. Mr. de Villepin clearly stated that questions arise regarding full membership of the EU for Bulgaria and Romania. That will be a major point unless we can sort out the constitution. Mr. Balkenende from the Netherlands clearly stated that it is a non-runner to give the same constitution back to the Dutch people. However, Mr. Sarkozy argues that perhaps part <Col N="88"/>one could be taken and passed through the French Parliament. People are at sixes and sevens on the issue.</P>
      <P>To return to what Deputy Rabbitte stated, one thing is clear. Many people in France had real difficulty with the third part of the constitution. In terms of the concept of globalisation, the question we must face as Europeans is whether the European Union is an agent for globalisation or a bulwark against the worst effects of globalisation. That is what the European citizen wants to know. We must take a fresh look at this issue. I support the views such as those held by the NGO More Democracy, which played a great role in the last constitutional debate when it put forward ideas for the citizen&rsquo;s initiative. It argues that we need a new convention and a new constitution. This idea was also put forward by the Polish<?oasys _jy ?>President today.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government to listen to those voices examining the problem. Undoubtedly there is a new dynamic within the European Union. Events that nobody foresaw have taken place, even in the security debate. We know the accession states are more NATO-friendly than others. They have a completely different point of view which must be considered. It is possible to get a more simplified text on which European people will agree. Ultimately, the people consider job security and their social protection must be a number one priority.</P>
      <P>They also consider the question of sustainability referred to by Deputy Quinn. We require a protocol on sustainability, which was suggested for the constitution but unfortunately it was rejected. We must examine that. I welcome the recommendations from the summit on climate change and sustainable energy. It is a move in the right direction. In particular, I welcome the fact we are now examining reducing the impact of aviation on the climate. It will be the biggest source of greenhouse gases and yet we take cheap flights for granted. There is hope that when the European Union starts to address these issues which concern the citizen, we will then make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the time constraints, I will make a few comments on the budget agreement reached last December. As we know, the European Council reached agreement on the budget for 2007-13. However, the European Parliament is not happy and we expressed this opinion forcibly last week in Strasbourg. Why are we unhappy? Like Oliver Twist, we want more. As the Minister is well aware, we need more. For 2006, the financial perspectives amount to 1.093% of EU GNI. However, the agreement reached in December foresees an average figure of 1.05% of EU GNI. In total, we are speaking about &euro;862 billion. While that figure is enormous, in reality we are facing cutbacks.</P>
      <P>Last June, the European Parliament agreed that in order to ensure a better match of political <Col N="89"/>priorities and financial needs, a financial commitment of &euro;974 billion, or 1.18% of EU gross national income, was required. Hence, we face a shortfall of &euro;112 billion and the battle lines are drawn.</P>
      <P>The Parliament rejects the Council&rsquo;s conclusion because the reduction in commitments in respect of competitiveness, growth and employment will jeopardise the Lisbon Agenda and because they do not guarantee a budget that will meet the commitments made to all member states, particularly to the new member states. In other words, the proposed agreement will not guarantee a budget that will enhance prosperity, competitiveness, solidarity, cohesion and security in the future. There will be tough negotiations ahead because the Parliament has the power of veto on the budget. However, at least we have a framework and a basis for negotiation and can begin to plan.</P>
      <P>Many of the ten new countries will be bitterly disappointed by the cut in cohesion funding. There is also genuine concern throughout Europe that this budget will not deliver on competitiveness and innovation. While everyone is talking about the Lisbon Agenda, to deliver the Lisbon strategy the EU must increase and not cut its investment in research and development. In this context, alarm bells should be ringing here at home. Ireland has just been ranked 11th in the most recent edition of the European innovation scoreboard, with Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Germany and Denmark cited as the leaders in innovation. This bad news was compounded by the results of another study which showed that within two years, Ireland will plummet from third to 21st place in a European league table measuring information and communications technology skills. Hence, given that the EU is cutting back on funding into research and development and innovations, we must act quickly and decisively at home.</P>
      <P>From an Irish perspective, there are positives and negatives in this budget. One of the positives is the allocation of &euro;200 million to the PEACE programme for 2007 to 2013. The EU has invested in excess of &euro;1.25 billion in the PEACE programmes, and while &euro;200 million is a major reduction, nonetheless it represents a genuine commitment. I congratulate the Government on its negotiating ability in convincing its EU partners to continue with this support. However, now that European funding is decreasing, it is essential that both governments allocate mainstream funding to PEACE projects. I also congratulate the Government on securing &euro;800 million for cohesion funding. However, I ask it to spend it in areas of need. From 2000 to 2003, only 14% of all cohesion funding was spent in the BMW region. Cohesion means convergence and bringing all regions to the same level, not spending the money on areas where GDP is almost 50% higher than in others. Unfortunately, there has been a substantial cut in rural development funding and as Ireland faces a cut of almost 35%, this will have <Col N="90"/>major implications for the rural economy here. It is crucial the Government makes up the deficit and creates the dynamic rural development policy necessary to offset the reduction in numbers in the agricultural economy.</P>
      <P>Finally, I welcome the proposed review of the budget in 2008 and 2009 and look forward to constructive and positive negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament on the next financial perspectives.</P>

	<P>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;onn Sinn F&eacute;in roimh roinnt de thortha&iacute; na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta ar bhuis&eacute;ad na hEorpa.

      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is relieved that the CAP will remain unaltered until 2013, provided the Government is willing to use its veto to ensure it. However, with regard to the question of rural development, the party remains of the opinion that the issue has been and still is conceptualised too narrowly at EU level. Sinn F&eacute;in believes the budget discussions would benefit from employing greater and broader understanding of the concept of rural development, to fully encompass issues such as rural regeneration or rejuvenation to replace declining agriculture. Some of the ideas expressed in the House, such as those of Deputy Quinn concerning the Bord na M&oacute;na lands, were imaginative. As far as agriculture is concerned, such thinking will be needed in the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to express Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s disappointment with regard to the overarching focus on the financial perspectives in this debate. An opportunity has been missed, whereby a commitment to emphasise spending on social protection and the environment could have been, but was not, achieved. This reaffirms the party&rsquo;s belief that the social inclusion aspect, along with the environmental consideration of the Lisbon Agenda, amount to little more than window dressing.</P>
      <P>The complete lack of transparency surrounding the workings of the Council is of grave concern to Sinn F&eacute;in. How are people to know exactly what was prioritised by the Government&rsquo;s representatives during the negotiations? Only this week, a report from the EU&rsquo;s own ombudsman was highly critical of the Council&rsquo;s opaqueness. Is addressing this undemocratic reality a priority of the Government and if so, how will it ensure the Council becomes more transparent? Secrecy <Col N="91"/>facilitates abuse of basic human rights and the secret agreement between this State and the United States concerning security measures for the protection of classified military information demonstrates that point all too well. I call on the Government to demand an emergency meeting of the Council of Ministers to discuss the issue of extraordinary renditions, including the role undertaken by each member state in respect of this illegal practice, as well as to finalise a binding agreement committing member states to co-operate fully with all investigations into this matter and to take every possible measure to stop the practice of extraordinary renditions. In the interests of transparency and accountability, discussions of this meeting should be in the public domain and open for all to see.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to group the questions together and if I get an opportunity, I will return to them towards the end of the debate. I concur with the views expressed by my party leader, as well as by Deputies Rabbitte and Quinn of the Labour Party in respect of some of the developments that have taken place. As for the EU sugar regime, it has been suggested in certain quarters that, contrary to popular opinion, the beneficiaries of the new regime will not necessarily be the poorest producers in Africa and other places. Can the Minister comment? Moreover, if this information is correct, can he give some indication as to what the likely response could or should be?</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the European response to the illegal drugs trade, the illegality of drugs importation, the enormous profits that emanate from it and the degree to which such profits can be and are laundered in international locations, as well as everything else that goes with it. Hence, in this respect, the European Union must be clearer in its mission as to how the problem should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>A number of other speakers made references to energy. Energy supplies, like those of food, are something on which one cannot depend indefinitely, especially if it is in short supply. On the energy regime that needs to be developed for the future, could the Minister indicate, for instance, to what extent the European Union will be able to develop a policy that will at least create a certain amount of independence in so far as energy supplies and requirements, particularly of alternative energy, are concerned?</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to raise two final questions. At what stage will it be possible for the European Union to indicate its proposals on the ratification of the EU constitution? Will there be changes or discussions on changes, or how is it intended to achieve the support necessary for ratification of the constitution, given the results of two electoral tests that have taken place already?</P>
      <P Just="Left">My final question relates to the reference made in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech to rural development. <Col N="92"/>As a person who was born in rural Ireland, I have a certain suspicion about that particular phrase because it is a nicely rounded one. It sounds grand and gives the impression of greatness and goodness emanating from a magic pot that will produce funding. What does rural development mean and what will it mean in future? What does the European Union now mean by rural development? Does it mean investment in rural infrastructure or in infrastructure of some nature that will be of benefit to rural economies? One must remember that as our towns and villages get more densely populated there is an area where rural Ireland can make a contribution, and I want to know whether that is likely to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of the questions Deputy Durkan raised were not really pertinent to the discussions and were not discussed at the December Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The sugar regime is ultimately a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, who was party to the discussions in Hong Kong. Obviously some difficult decisions had to be made in that regard and it is fair to say the discussions in Hong Kong faltered in that there was an impression that quite a number of developing countries were to a certain extent benefiting. Our sustained focus on those discussions was to ensure the least developed countries would benefit from free trade and we were reasonably successful in getting that point across.</P>
      <P>During my time as Minister for energy I was always conscious that this island is on the edge of Europe, as was raised by a number of Deputies. We are at the extremity of the gas pipelines coming from Russia. If one looks at the map of the gas grid, it is quite significant to see where we are. Thankfully, over the past number of years the Government has put substantial funding into the construction of gas pipelines that link us with the UK. As Minister for energy, I made this point on the mix of the type of supply on many occasions. Given that historically this country has been vehemently anti-nuclear for good and valid reasons related to issues like Sellafield, we must rely increasingly on gas, coal and other fossil fuels and, hopefully, on renewable energy. As a strong supporter of renewable energy, particularly during my time as Minister for energy, I know it is an extremely difficult and complex area. While everyone is in favour of renewable energy, it is difficult to get the critical mass in this sector to have it as a substantial part of the energy mix. I say this as somebody who looks daily out on a wind turbine in Dundalk Institute of Technology, only a mile from where I live. In this cold weather where there is no wind that wind turbine is not moving at all and as a result on the coldest day of the year it is not supplying any energy to the <Col N="93"/>grid. If wind farms are built in substantial numbers one must also provide approximately similar capacity in fossil fuel facilities to ensure supply on those coldest days when demand is highest.</P>
      <P>Regarding an all-Ireland energy policy, my successor, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, took up the baton in putting together an energy policy for the next ten years. I understand that is still being discussed within his Department and the various agencies which feed into it. The intention is to bring forward a long-term policy on energy supply. This and the gas pipeline news of recent weeks brings into greater focus the absolute need for us to exploit our indigenous gas supplies. That is one of the reasons we were strong supporters of ensuring every opportunity is taken, provided all the conditions on safety etc. are adhered to, to use all the gas supply possibilities available to us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan raised a number of issues related to the EU constitution. As regards ratification, as he will be aware it was agreed previously that there would be a period of reflection which would culminate at the end of the Austrian Presidency. The Austrian Foreign Minister recently wrote to all the member state governments. Recently I replied giving our view on it, that we should hasten slowly on this matter, that we should look at the period of reflection and perhaps even extend it. We are adamant that we should not touch the text of the EU constitution but that perhaps we should look at ways in which its context should be changed because it was ultimately an extremely fine balance reached after tough negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not answer a couple of questions. What about rural development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not go through a long dissertation on rural development but the point of the rural development programme in EU funding is to assist those areas coming out of purely agricultural industry and to bring them into newer areas not so reliant on agriculture. That has been the hallmark of European funding over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister for being part of this European Council agreement because if one looked back to the difficulties evident at the Luxembourg Council, reaching agreement at the subsequent Council on the EU budget and the Cohesion Funds for the accession countries appeared almost insurmountable.</P>
      <P>My first question relates to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement that the agreement provides that from 2013, at the latest, Britain will fully participate in the financing of enlargement costs for countries that acceded to the EU after April 2004, except <Col N="94"/>for CAP market expenditure. The subject of the British rebate has been discussed at length at the Joint Committee on European Affairs. The unanimous view at that committee was that the British rebate was negotiated at a time when Britain was a much poorer country than it is now and that there was no excuse at this stage for a British rebate of any kind. I appreciate agreement had to be reached. Will the Minister clarify what &ldquo;except for CAP market expenditure&rdquo; means? Is that the sole extent to which the British rebate will remain intact?</P>
      <P>I refer to Cohesion Funds for the accession states. Ireland benefited significantly from the provision of such funds for a number of years and they helped us to become a successful economy. Many of the accession states such as Poland desperately need these supports to raise their standard of living up to ours and to develop their economies. I very much support the European project and I was appalled that had the British rebate been maintained, these member states would have been denied their just entitlements, which had been agreed when they acceded to the Union approximately a year ago. They were promised Cohesion Funds and supports. Will they receive what they were promised in the agreements?</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Iranian nuclear programme was also discussed at the European Council. The seals had not been broken at one of the Iranian nuclear testing sites at the time but every member state is concerned about Iran&rsquo;s position. A theory being put forward is that Iran is seeking security guarantees and economic assistance and it has no interest in developing nuclear weapons. Was the Iranian issue discussed in the broader context of the Middle East or was the discussion confined<?oasys _jy ?>to Iran&rsquo;s compliance with the demands of the IAEA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The budgetary correction mechanism, called the UK rebate, remains with the reduced contribution to the financing of the abatement, benefiting Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, as agreed at the 1999 Berlin European Council. The rebate remains in full on all expenditure except that relating to the new member states. From 2013 at the latest, the UK shall fully participate in the financing of the enlargement costs of countries that acceded after 30 April 2004, except for CAP market expenditure, which relates to direct payments and market-related expenditure as well as rural development expenditure originating from the EAGGF guarantee section.</P>
      <P>To this end, the UK budgetary mechanism shall be adjusted by progressively reducing the total allocated expenditure in line with the modalities in annexe 2 to that document. Between 2007 and 2013, the additional contribution from the UK shall not be higher than &euro;10.5 billion in comparison with the application of the current own resources decision. The key issue in the <Col N="95"/>December discussions was the amount and there was a significant debate on that. Between 2007 and 2013, the UK&rsquo;s contribution will gradually increase towards the cost of enlargement but the CAP-related cost will not be taken into account in this regard.</P>
      <P>There was a division between the larger states and net contributors to the budget, which wanted to keep the ceiling as low as possible and the benefiting countries and other member states such as Ireland which felt the accession countries had to obtain a fair share of the funds and all the richer states should make valid contributions. During the discussions, it was generally felt that while the British were saying they wanted to pay for enlargement, ultimately, because of their refusal to discuss the issue of the UK rebate in the months leading up to the meeting, they caused an impasse, which meant that all countries were not fairly contributing to the cost of enlargement. While the accession countries were satisfied with the compromise on the funds, individually, they would probably say they did not receive enough. A total of &euro;170 billion in Cohesion Funds is available over the seven-year period for the accession states and, therefore, substantial resources will be available to them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Circumstances have changed, unfortunately, for the worse regarding the Iranian issue since the December Council. The IAEA board of governors will meet on 2 February and the situation is evolving on a daily basis. The Iranians are due to meet the Russians on 16 February to discuss the Russian proposal on how to get around the issue. However, this is an extremely difficult and potentially dangerous scenario. The Government and the EU believe we should continue to seek a diplomatic resolution to this problem. There is a long way to go and we will continue to push at EU level to ensure all diplomatic channels are used to get the Iranians to see sense.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On the one hand, they point out they are entitled under the NPT and other international agreements to move on the issue of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes while, on the other hand, a number of UN member states believe they have other intentions in this regard. However, independent examinations of what they have been doing show they have not told the full truth regarding what is going on. They are not being fully transparent with the IAEA inspectors and, as a result, the wider international community feels they should be pressed harder on the commitments they have made on ensuring this activity is for peaceful means only. I assure the Deputy we will keep a close eye on this.</P>

        <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5">deplores the fact that the Government has supported the proposed services directive which would have damaging economic and social implications and, aware that the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, has stated in the context of this directive that the concerns of the different sectors must be taken on board and also that the Austrian economic Minister, Mr. Martin Bartenstein, said in his statement that a precondition for the success of the services directive would be that it convincingly excludes wage and social dumping, calls on the Government to state that in the context of the next partnership negotiations, it will reject the proposed services directive and, in particular, the &ldquo;country of origin&rdquo; principle.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I am pleased to propose this motion on my behalf, on behalf of my Independent colleagues, Deputies James Breen, Connolly, Cowley, Gregory, Healy, Finian McGrath, McHugh and Catherine Murphy, and on behalf of Deputy Joe Higgins. The proposed directive on services is wide ranging and deals with everything from child care to car care, from mobile telephone contracts to mobile chip vans, from baby-sitters to dog-sitters, from the installation of a new kitchen to the fitting of dental crowns. This short list gives some idea of the scope of what we are discussing. We must also take into account that there are 25 &mdash; and soon will be 27 &mdash; countries with different regulatory regimes, legislation, standards, costs, incomes, cultures, expectations and languages. When we further consider that there is no harmonisation and no accepted and agreed overall standards for the provision of services across the EU, we get a fuller picture of the situation.</P>
        <P>I do not contend that there should be no liberalisation of services. It is impossible, however, that one directive &mdash; a single piece of legislation &mdash; should be adequate to deal with all the differ<Col N="98"/>ent and complex issues, particularly when that legislation is firmly based on the country of origin principle. To quote a phrase circulating in Brussels, it is &ldquo;Commission Impossible&rdquo;. A directive on services is required but not the directive as currently proposed. Commissioner McCreevy now accepts this. He has said he would not bet on the country of origin principle getting through as it stands.</P>
        <P>The Government and our Commissioner have consistently backed the services directive as proposed. They are, however, becoming increasingly isolated in their stance. The President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso, has spoken of the need for a revised proposal and emphasised the need for balance, something blatantly missing from this directive. The President of the Council, Chancellor Schussel, has announced he will bring the social partners into the process so they may be part of the solution. The Austrian economic Minister, meanwhile, has said Austria will fight for a wholesale rewriting of the draft directive. His assertion that the directive should be seen as a driver&rsquo;s licence that allows companies to take their services across European borders while obliging them to abide by local speed limits and driving rules is the most sensible and reasonable suggestion I have heard.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt we will hear during this debate that the posting of workers directive will deal with the various issues. This directive is not being implemented in this State, however, as seen in the inadequate resources and woefully inadequate number of labour inspectors. This directive will guarantee the minimum wage but that wage is approximately half the average industrial wage. Is this what we want? If there is a downturn in the economy, will we see a situation where those on the average industrial wage will be let go and those on the minimum wage, protected by the posting of workers directive, will be kept on? Furthermore, the latter directive will not deal with issues such as educational qualifications and training of service providers. The term &ldquo;posted worker&rdquo; refers to a worker who, for a limited period, carries out work in another member state. The posting of workers directive, therefore, provides no long-term solution.</P>
        <P>Information about the services directive on the website of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment tells us that Irish consumers will benefit from increased competition in different sectors of the economy. This sounds good but will the practice adhere to the theory? How will an Irish consumer make an accurate assessment of the quality and standard of a particular service? Will he or she be required to look up the relevant legislation in country A, consult the training requirements in country B, check the safety record in country C and compare the costs with countries, D, E, F, G and so on? When Bulgaria and Romania join the Union, probably next January, there will be 27 members and insufficient letters in the alphabet to deal with all this.</P><Col N="99"/>
        <P>Liberalisation of services will benefit the EU economically but not as proposed in the current directive. Legislation must deliver for the ordinary person, for families and communities. It is not enough that it delivers merely for the economy. The Taoiseach should demonstrate his socialist credentials by joining with those calling for a balanced and equitable services directive that opens up the market while ensuring the rights of citizens, workers and consumers are fully protected.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal for a new services directive, the brainchild of former EU Commissioner Bolkestein, is under attack from all sides. It has been called the &ldquo;Frankenstein directive&rdquo; and the &ldquo;directive from hell&rdquo;. It even emerged as an issue in the French referendum campaign on the EU constitutional treaty. It represents a declaration of war on working men and women and their social, health care and educational provisions, which are the fruits of two centuries of struggle. Even the European Council has called for it to be profoundly revised to safeguard the European social model.</P>
        <P>In January 1993, the Single Market was supposed to come into effect providing four basic freedoms, namely, of goods, capital, persons and services. One would have expected the services sector would have been opened up after more than 13 years and that there would be no need to liberalise trade and services at this point. Until now, free movement of services, which accounts for 70% of the EU&rsquo;s employment, has been strangled by a patchwork of legislation and red tape. Many EU member states continue to display a distinctly unco-operative attitude to foreigners who try to establish small businesses on their territory. The proposed directive is more than a hammer to break a nut since the nut is treated as if it were a weapon of mass destruction. It sends the legal equivalent of stealth bombers to hammer those responsible into submission. In its current form, the directive would expose all services to the cold draft of market-based competition. What will the exposure of essential services to pre-competition mean? The heart of the services directive, the country of origin principle, so beloved by Gama and Irish Ferries, is the most disturbing aspect of the proposal.</P>
        <P>We need definitive clarification on a number of issues. Would it allow companies to provide services in any EU member state following the rules and laws not of the country where the services will be provided but of the country where it is established? Established does not necessarily mean that a firm has any real roots in a particular part of the world, since a US multinational could simply establish itself in Latvia or Lithuania, for example, by registering its presence there as a post box company. It could mean that it could trade in Ireland or any part of the EU by conforming only to the Latvian or Lithuanian law on <Col N="100"/>matters like health and safety, workers&rsquo; rights and environmental protection. Unscrupulous multinationals wishing to exploit fully the directive need only ascertain the various countries&rsquo; strengths and weaknesses before deciding where to establish themselves.</P>
        <P>It would not take long for Irish companies to cotton on. Irish Ferries amply demonstrated how quickly it could do so. As a result, labour relations would be soured and poisoned well into the future. Differences in standards of pay and social security must not be used to play one economy off against the other until the lowest level of social protection has been reached. Country of origin is the most dangerous and offensive aspect of the proposal, which is utterly unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Recently, there was reference to the mushroom industry in Cavan and Monaghan. It is an important part of industry in that area but a wrong is a wrong regardless of where it happens. If a cleaner in a school is exploited, every school should not be tarred with the same brush. There is a feeling in the mushroom industry in Cavan and Monaghan, which is such a vital part of the economy in the area, that the industry is being singled out for criticism. More than 95% of growers in the area treat all workers, both national and non-nationals, the same. They are paid the same rates. It is a low wage industry but it is an important part of the economy in the area. It is worthwhile pointing out that there were 900 mushroom growers in the area just a few years ago. In the past 18 months, the area lost more than 50 growers and there are now just 150 growers in the Cavan and Monaghan area.</P>

	<P>The Independent Group in this House will always stand with working people, the weaker sections of society and for international solidarity with our immigrant workers. Before going into the details of the motion, I want to set down a few clear markers in the debate. Racism, like sectarianism, will never be tolerated in this debate. Those attempting to frighten our citizens with deliberate or populous ill-thought out views should be challenged. I am challenging them in this debate, regardless of who they are. Inequality, racism and low pay should never be tolerated in a wealthy country like Ireland. That is my bottom line whether one is a media person, a politician or a trade union official or when I hear a senior political figure, the Leader in the Seanad, using old colonial phrases like &ldquo;working like blacks&rdquo;, a Labour Party leader <Col N="101"/>speaking in a crude manner about 40 million or so Poles, a scriptwriter in &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; using the phrase &ldquo;Mongol&rdquo; to describe a person with Down&rsquo;s syndrome or a serious newspaper like <i>The Irish Times</i> misrepresenting a report on educational disadvantage by using a misleading headline like &ldquo;Lone parents&rsquo; pupils read less well&rdquo; when it was poor pupils who read less well.</P>
        <P>I will challenge people in this House, no matter how unpopular it is. It is not just a matter of political correctness but a matter of decency and treating all people, creeds and races with respect and equality. These are the core issues in the debate and cheap and exploited labour should never be tolerated in Ireland or in any country. The way forward is for all of us to ensure that workers, particularly immigrant workers, are members of a trade union. So many are not and are open to abuse. I would like to challenge employers on this issue and raise the issue of social partnership because the services directive is being used by some employers to undermine established rates of pay and safe and reasonable working conditions negotiated by workers through their trades union.</P>
        <P>Speaking of workers and trades union, I raise the case of Ms Joanne Delaney, a trade union member, who has been victimised in this country. An employee of Dunnes Stores in the Ashleaf Centre in Crumlin in Dublin, she has been sacked by the supermarket chain for wearing her union badge in the workplace. Ms Delaney, a shop steward at the store, recently received an indefinite suspension from work for wearing a badge identifying her as a member of MANDATE, the union which represents more than 40,000 workers in the retail sector and bar trade, including staff at Dunnes Stores. Joanne received a letter on 29 November 2005 informing her that she had been dismissed by the company.</P>
        <P>Dunnes Stores has accused her of not complying with company policy on wearing her union badge on her uniform. The MANDATE member was suspended by a manager at the store on 18 October for refusing to remove the MANDATE trade union badge from her uniform. The suspended member was advised to attend a disciplinary meeting at 6 p.m. on Friday, 21 October. However, the meeting was cancelled owing to the fact that she was accompanied by her union representative. The company has continually denied her the right to be represented by a trade union official at meetings with management.</P>
        <P>I welcome Joanne to the D&aacute;il and ask the Minister to intervene in the matter. Joanne and the staff of MANDATE have our total support. The Independent Deputies in this House are behind them and we will highlight the issue both in the D&aacute;il and other forums.</P>
        <P>This motion is about the protection of workers&rsquo; rights. It is about justice and equality for all workers. The motion, which is tabled by the Independent Deputies in this House, shows leadership on the racism issue. It is about building and <Col N="102"/>embracing change with our citizens and putting their needs at the heart of society. I urge all Deputies to support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The fight for workers&rsquo; rights and good working conditions has been a long and arduous battle, championed by the trade union movement and strong political figures, both local and national, down through the decades. This country now attracts workers and employers on a world scale. In theory, these workers and our own labour force have had the security of our national licensing and monitoring bodies to safeguard their working conditions. However, there have been notable failures, including the case of Gama construction workers, on whose behalf my colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins, initiated the fight when no Government Deputy wanted to know about their plight. Other cases include the Irish Ferries employees and the mushroom pickers in Kilnaleck.</P>
        <P>Domestically, we have also had the shameful work practices at the Leas Cross nursing home. No one should think there are not others whose operational levels are not up to the appropriate standards. As the nation recovers from these still deep wounds, we are asked to support the directive on services in the Internal Market, under the stewardship of Commissioner McCreevy. This will lead to the haemorrhaging of hard fought good work practices and a strong labour force.</P>
        <P>The overriding theme of this directive is competition at the expense of quality. The case of the Leas Cross nursing home highlighted many serious flaws in our elderly care system. While the Minister, Deputy Harney, was quick to set up an inquiry, this was just after the whole country became aware of the situation through the national broadcaster. The services directive removes any monitoring or regulatory controls in the case of any elderly care service provider based in any other EU member state who decides to set up practice here. The service provider would only be subject to the regulations of their country of origin regardless of whether the regulations are good, bad or indifferent.</P>
        <P>In the construction industry, the plight of the Gama workers could be repeated over and over, but this time with no form of redress available. On the other side of that coin, employers in this country would find it almost impossible to compete effectively here in future. The Health and Safety Authority has been ultra-critical of the lack of improvement in certain construction industry practices. Every year, instances of accidents resulting in serious injury or death are the norm. This directive would allow certain employers from states with less stringent health and safety standards to operate here without complying with any of our national authority&rsquo;s requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For years, successive Governments have mooted improvements in the licensing and moni<Col N="103"/>toring of those involved in security services. This Bill opens the door for any company providing security services, including cash transit security services in another member state, to operate here subject only to their country of origin controls. This could potentially put at risk or expose a large portion of the public.</P>
        <P>A major by-product of this directive is the risk of marginalising or ghettoising foreign workers brought here to work in the services sector. These workers are often set up in satellite villages, similar to the Gama workforce, and, consequently, are not in a position to socially or financially integrate in a viable manner. Instead of gaining freedom of movement and improvement in living standards, this directive merely gives licence to further repress such individuals. Because of such employers&rsquo; ability to undercut Irish-based industries, it puts at risk the jobs and livelihoods of Irish employers and their families where currently the service industry provides 70% of our employment.</P>
        <P>In May of last year French voters said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the EU constitution by a considerable majority. Some 70% of the electorate turned out to vote and 55% of them voted against the constitution. The no campaign used the services directive and its economic and social implications as a stick with which to hammer the yes campaign. In this D&aacute;il term we hope to pass the Bill enabling the accession to the EU of Romania and Bulgaria. The House should protect our workers and safeguard the future of our labour force and employers not by seeking amendments to this directive but by urging its complete withdrawal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green group in the European Parliament with their socialist colleagues have led the opposition to the services directive. During a meeting on 22 November of the committee in the Parliament that examines it, we opposed the votes by the conservative groups, the liberals, on the amendments they proposed. We must be careful in this debate to ascertain what people are doing rather than what they are saying. It is easy in these directives, complex as they are, to take a line in public but the outcome in terms of one&rsquo;s voting pattern in the European Parliament may lead to something completely different. This will be difficult to ascertain but I am confident about it. We are collectively supporters of our Green colleagues in Europe who have voted consistently and raised this issue. We as a party raised some of the issues involved when it was not fashionable or favourable to do so during the middle of the Nice treaty referendums when other parties questioned our European credentials and motives for doing so. It is welcome to hear the arguments we raised then, for which we got such stick, being raised again.</P>
        <P>The issues in the services directive are complex and, to a certain extent, my colleagues have gone through them. I refer to concerns about the coun<Col N="104"/>try of origin principle, as mentioned by Deputy Harkin, and the concern that services relating to our general economic interest will be included. These are the real issues and the meat of the discussion on which the debate will have to focus in the European Parliament. The debate here should focus on what our parties are doing and how they are voting in the European Parliament as that is where the real issue will be concluded.</P>
        <P>In particular, there is an issue around the policing of labour standards in Europe under the guise of such a common European services directive. The Greens&rsquo; campaign in Europe has been based on a strong argument for introducing a services directive and opening up services but stresses the need to protect the European social model. This is an issue on which we will take a stand. Proper policing of standards is required where transnational commerce is taking place.</P>
        <P>I attended the SIPTU conference on the services directive last week, which was well organised and massively attended. One of the concerns that emerged from it was that the pay and conditions of workers would deteriorate under a further opening up of the European market. The response that we have minimum wage legislation is not an answer to people with that concern. While our minimum wage legislation is welcome it cannot become a standard wage. Furthermore, it should not be the case that the minimum wage applied is that which applies in the European member state with the lowest level of pay. That is a concern and is the detail that must be worked out in the negotiation of the services directive, namely, that the opening up of services does not lead to such a phenomenon occurring.</P>
        <P>I wish to open up this debate which I welcome. Deputy Finian McGrath opened up the debate with his contribution. A debate commenced recently on the issue of workers from the east already here. It is appropriate for the D&aacute;il to take a lead and show our nation the way forward in how we should treat foreign workers. The Green Party does not believe the lead we should show is to restrict access to this country by workers from fellow European member countries which joined recently. That is not the proper way to lead this country or the European Union. It is remarkable that some parties or we as a country appear to be considering such an approach when other countries in the European Union are opening up in the way that we did three years ago. How would the message be received in the European Union that a country with full employment and that supposedly is the embodiment of all the success of this neo-liberal economic model wants to restrict workers when other countries with higher unemployment rates want to open up to receiving them?</P>
        <P>How would that be a sensible move for this country given that such a strategy could apply for only a limited time under the treaties we have signed? We would be able to negotiate the <Col N="105"/>measure only for a period but those provisions would come to an end. How could we assure that such opening up to a permit system would eradicate the disadvantage and discrimination that is occurring? My understanding of the permit system was that it gave less control to people coming here. It put the control in the hands of the employer. I am uncertain as to how a proposal to return to such a permit system for people from the accession states would address the issue of discrimination, where it occurs, of European workers coming here.</P>
        <P>The experience on a European level to date has been positive, even in a country, namely Sweden, that has gone further than us, although there is a need for concern about the cases taken there. Having examined the position in Sweden last week, we noticed that while that state has opened up not only to labour access but also to social welfare provisions, its experience was that a minimum number of people had travelled there and availed of the social welfare circumstances. To a certain extent the experience in this country has been similarly positive. We should not view it, as Fianna F&aacute;il does, as yet another great cog in the engine of construction growth, which seems to be its sole arbiter of success or otherwise in an economy. We should not seek people to come here for the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; purpose which is for nothing other than to ensure economic growth indicators grow in order that people at the top of society can accumulate massive wealth. In general, the experience has been a positive one for this country.</P>
        <P>In terms of anecdotal evidence as to what is happening, separate from the debate that has commenced, our party carried out anecdotal research by questioning 500 business people in small businesses in my constituency on the south side of Dublin. Some 400 of these business people responded. We asked them what were the major concerns of their businesses and set out a number of possible issues, including transport problems, of which no doubt there are enough, building costs and difficulty in obtaining suitable employees. Of the 400 employers who responded, their number one difficulty and main concern was obtaining suitable employees. While this research is anecdotal it highlights a major concern. That is a remarkable finding in my constituency of the reality facing business people.</P>
        <P>There are issues of discrimination. We have a shameful record in our lack of a proper labour inspectorate and proper implementation of working conditions. I welcome this debate if it brings about greater control and enforcement of existing legislation. However, we also need to examine the broader context of what is happening.</P>
        <P>Like many other people, I am a former economic migrant. I worked illegally in the United States and Australia. I worked in London as a &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; in the bars and elsewhere. My experience in those countries was that never once did I have a sense that I was not welcome. I was dis<Col N="106"/>placing another worker no doubt, I was taking a displacing job, so to speak, but never once was I made feel unwelcome or required to have a permit to work. In terms of the approach we should take, I argue that the experience in this context in Australia, with which we identify and connect, although there are certain bad aspects to it, is what we should repeat here. One of the attractive strategies that has worked in America is the way it has opened up its economy. We possibly need to follow that example, while ensuring it leads to the implementation of the highest social model here. We should take what is best from the European Union, while recognising that we can afford to open up.</P>
        <P>Our identity is being brought into question. We have come out of a long period when we could identify ourselves only as green or as orange, or in terms of how we related to the neighbouring island. We are starting to stand on our own two feet as a country and to consider ourselves as part of the EU and the wider world. We are succeeding in that regard. This is a crucial debate, to a certain extent. I welcome it because we need to define ourselves in the broader context of how we see ourselves and how we see workers from other parts of the EU. If we approach this issue in a positive and constructive manner, it will lead to a more positive, constructive and creative economy. We need to ensure that we provide for the highest and best labour standards as part of that process. We will oppose the services directive at EU level because it does not do that. We propose and support the development of the EU on an equal and open basis.</P>

        <P>I commend the Independent Deputies who have brought this motion before the House. The services directive poses a grave threat to labour standards and existing rights. It is important the directive is discussed in the D&aacute;il and that Deputies are given the opportunity to register their opposition to it. The onslaught on the rights of workers is under way. Their terms and conditions of employment are under attack. An increasing number of employers are attempting to displace their existing workforces and replace them with migrant workers on lower rates of pay and with diminished conditions. The services directive will bring this onslaught to a whole new level. It will attack the ability of the Government to protect and uphold the rights of workers within the State. Sinn F&eacute;in is vehemently opposed to the EU Directive on Services in the Internal Market. The D&aacute;il must send a clear signal to the EU that it will not accept the directive or tolerate workers&rsquo; standards and conditions being shredded at the whim of faceless bureaucrats in Brussels. Members must be unanimous in our opposition to the directive. It is vital that the public should be made aware of how the Government intends <Col N="107"/>to vote on this issue at the Council of Ministers if the directive makes it through the European Parliament.</P>

	<P>I would love to respond to the comments of the Minister, Deputy Martin, but I cannot hear them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the people were given an opportunity to give their opinion on the directive, I am quite confident they would reject it in no uncertain terms. The directive will lead to widescale replication of the circumstances at Irish Ferries, to which the public demonstrated its opposition last month, when perhaps more than 100,000 people took to the streets of Dublin. Public awareness of the implications of the directive needs to be heightened. Some EU Governments, which understand the depth of their voters&rsquo; opposition to the directive, have said they will not accept the proposal. I am calling on the Government to follow suit and to declare its outright opposition to any EU measure which will undermine the rights, pay and conditions of workers. When the Minister responds to this motion, I challenge him to state unequivocally the Government&rsquo;s precise position on this matter.</P>
        <P>The directive includes the country of origin principle, to which my colleagues have alluded. The principle will allow companies which were established in one country to provide services in another country using the standards of the first country rather than those of the country in which they are operating. Under the directive, companies which establish themselves in the EU country with the lowest standards of workers&rsquo; rights and environmental protection, which is also important, will benefit from such low standards, even when operating in an EU country with more advanced levels of workers&rsquo; rights and employment legislation. This encourages a race to the bottom, with companies shopping around for the lowest standards in the EU. Member states will be under pressure to lower their standards in order to remain competitive.</P>
        <P>The directive is the responsibility of the EU Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy, whose anti-worker agenda is well known in Ireland and increasingly recognised across Europe. In common with the European Trade Union Confederation, Sinn F&eacute;in believes the current text does not secure high-quality services and social progress in the EU. It recognises and acknowledges that the Internal Market committee made some improvements to the Commission&rsquo;s draft, for example by stating the objective of the directive does not involve dealing with labour law, collective agreements and industrial action. The committee accepted that some public services, such as health, should be excluded from the scope of the directive. Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes such improvements and will strive to uphold them.</P><Col N="108"/>
        <P>In the vote in the European Parliament in a few weeks time, consideration will be given to some amendments which have been submitted and would improve the proposal. Sinn F&eacute;in will support any amendment that will help to protect workers&rsquo; rights. It particularly supports stronger and unambiguous language to ensure the directive does not interfere with labour law, collective bargaining and industrial relations in member states. Such language should refer explicitly to the right to take industrial action, where necessary. Service activities should be regulated by the law of the country where the service is provided or carried out. Sinn F&eacute;in is totally opposed to the country of origin principle because it would lead to a risk of downward regulatory competition between member states. The host country must be entitled to impose supervisory measures for all services provided on its territory. Member states need to be able to impose prior declarations and notifications on foreign service providers and to oblige them to have a representative in the host country. All economic or non-economic services of general interest, which is EU-speak for public services, should be excluded from the scope of the directive. I refer in particular to social services and water. Member states should be able to maintain high protection for their workers, consumers and the environment.</P>
        <P>As Sinn F&eacute;in remains opposed to the directive, its MEPs will vote to reject it in the European Parliament in February. The directive is a new and dramatic illustration of the chasm between much of the European political elite and the preoccupations of many EU citizens. There is widespread opposition to the directive among workers across the EU, many of whom are downright angry. The fury felt by workers and trade unions at the EU&rsquo;s attempts to undermine labour standards was evident during the recent rioting in Strasbourg by European dock workers who were protesting in opposition to the EU ports directive. Such protests are almost certain to be repeated when the services directive is voted on in February. The protests by 10,000 workers and the closure of ports by striking workers was followed by the rejection by the European Parliament of the directive, which would have liberalised port services throughout Europe. I commend the courage of the workers in question. The undemocratic nature of the EU does not allow citizens to register their opposition in any other way. If workers do not stand up and fight for their rights, such rights will be taken from them as part of the general shift to the right and the adoption of what is increasingly referred to as the neoliberal agenda of privatisation, deregulation and attacks on workers&rsquo; rights. Large-scale public opposition to the directive can achieve results, for example by forcing the Irish Government and other governments to vote against the directive. The trade union movement must work with other interests to mobilise the public in opposition to <Col N="109"/>the directive. If there is not a strong and clear public reaction to the directive over the next few weeks, we will run the risk of suffering a major defeat and a setback for millions of European workers, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can take it as read.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It notes the importance of services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is embarrassing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not. According to the amendment, services are important as a component of GDP and employment in the EU. It is worth noting that Ireland is the 14th largest <i>per capita</i> exporter of services in the world, that its share of world services increased significantly from 0.38% in 1993 to 2.2% in 2004 and that its employment and export growth in high value added internationally traded services activities has offset reductions in manufacturing. When one strips away the rhetoric from Deputy Harkin&rsquo;s remarks, one will find that she agrees it is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests, in areas like employment prospects, trade opportunities, consumer choice and welfare enhancement, that there should be an open Single Market in services in Europe. Various European economic institutes and Forf&aacute;s, in its impact assessment, have highlighted the benefits of opening the EU services market. Technical progress has been made on some aspects of the draft directive, to ensure that standards, especially of employment conditions, are generally protected, while seeking to ensure that the benefits of opening the EU services market are attainable, which is more or less what Deputy Eamon Ryan said when he spoke about opening the market while protecting the social model. Over the coming months, the European Commission is expected to introduce amendments to the draft directive. The amendments will be considered with an open mind, in full consultation with stakeholders, with the objective of securing the optimum outcome for Ireland&rsquo;s and Europe&rsquo;s economic and welfare interests, including the protection of employment standards.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded us to debate the proposed framework directive on services. It is just a proposed directive. Anybody who has been watching this in recent months knows it is work in progress and that there will be substantial change and amendments to the directive before it ever sees the light of day. Commissioner McCreevy reiterated that last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the first indication it would be changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not the first indication that there would be change, and to suggest that is <Col N="111"/>somewhat pathetic. There is much rhetoric taking place. In the motion tabled by the Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was the motion tabled?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;there are some sentiments with which we could agree but overall it lacks balance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a draft directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It inadequately and inaccurately reflects the position of the Government on a number of important issues and it inadequately reflects what is in the draft directive. That is the reason I tabled the Government amendment. I regret it has been so difficult to have a reasoned and rational discussion around the services directive. There are some legitimate concerns to be raised about it. Using language such as the Frankenstein directive to describe it and trying to play on people&rsquo;s fears and emotions by attributing doomsday implications to it, or ascribing to it provisions which are manifestly inaccurate, does not promote real debate.</P>
        <P>I challenge anyone in the House to demonstrate, for example, that the services directive, if implemented, would legitimise what occurred in the Gama episode or that it would lead to a replication of the Irish Ferries case, which is unique because of the particular international regulatory regime which applies to maritime commerce. These events happened without a services directive. Lets get real.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we expect to stop it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>They have happened without a services directive being in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not need it because there was no inspector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us move away from the rational approach to trying to lump everything in, in the context of debating the directive. Let us debate the substance of the directive and work towards achieving a consensus and the changes we want to bring about in the directive that best suits the Irish position overall. At the very least what the directive is trying to do is to put a legal framework around the development of a single open European services market, which is already guaranteed under the EU treaties. It will have no impact on Turkish workers pending the entry of Turkey into the European Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Turkey was just used as an example. The Minister is introducing red herrings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not but other Members have raised it wrongly. There are other issues to deal <Col N="112"/>with that but let us not blame the services directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In its original form, it would allow that carry on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Turkey is not in the European Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a disposition on the part of some people to try to confuse issues around immigration policy on the one hand and the services directive on the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>On this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Both are lumped together implicitly or explicitly as generating what is being referred to as a &ldquo;race to the bottom&rdquo;. The irony is that this is happening at a time when the economy was never more successful. On the one hand migratory inflows have been an essential ingredient in meeting our labour supply needs which has helped generate the levels of economic growth we have been achieving. Every respected economic commentator recognises that such inflows will be needed into the foreseeable future, as Deputy Eamon Ryan and Deputy Finian McGrath have acknowledged. This is apart from the moral entitlement of the newly acceded member states to the freedom of movement provisions of the EU treaties.</P>
        <P>On the other hand services are very much where our future lies, where the knowledge economy manifests itself and where human capital comes into its own. The enterprise strategy group identified the potential for Ireland to create a substantial number of new, quality jobs in sectors such as intellectual property, franchising, international marketing, creative services, shared and outsourced business processes, supply chain management, construction related services and consultancy services. We will not succeed in doing this on the basis of relying on our national market. We need to be able to develop and sell these services on a European and world platform.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment is a race to the top. The investments we are making in human capital, in our education system, in research and development, in attracting high value added inward investment, in our high-growth potential indigenous companies, are about putting in place the conditions for sustainable growth. The high-value services sector is an increasingly important part of that landscape.</P>
        <P>It is ironic that this muddled thinking between immigration policy and the services directive is being identified with assertions of wage undercutting and displacement. The empirical evidence, such as we have it, does not back this up. Between 1998 and 2003 nominal compensation, or wages, in Ireland grew by 37%, in contrast to <Col N="113"/>Germany where it grew by 8.7%. By 2004 gross annual average compensation in Ireland was just over &euro;38,000 as against an EU average of &euro;34,600. For 2005, the figure is &euro;40,010. Employee costs in 2005 grew by 4.9%, the fourth highest among 16 countries benchmarked by the National Competitiveness Council. This is not a manifestation of an economy in which significant wage undercutting is taking place.</P>
        <P>On the matter of displacement, we have the lowest unemployment rates in Europe. There is however some structural change taking place of which we need to be wary. Ironically it is not in the services sector but in the exposed and traded manufacturing sector where the pain is being felt most and competitive pressures apply. If there is a concern about potential displacement this is where it will be felt first. Our cost base, including our labour costs, are in danger of getting out of kilter. That is why it is essential, as we hopefully head into a new social partnership agreement, there must be moderation in wage demands.</P>
        <P>Ireland, and this Government, has been a supporter of the objective of developing a single open market in services in Europe. I was glad to hear Deputy Harkin say more or less the same when she said we need a social services directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the whole story.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying there should be no liberalisation of trade. This is what Deputy<?oasys _jy ?>Harkin has put on the record. The distance between Deputy Harkin&rsquo;s position and the Government&rsquo;s position is by no means significant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is significant where this directive is concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>If one strips away the rhetoric that is what one will find in terms of the analysis of the debate so far. While the focus of public and political debate on the economy is often on manufacturing, most economic activity in Ireland revolves around the production of services, which includes everything from lawyers to libraries and software to stockbrokers. The services sector generates approximately 70% of GNP in the EU and in Ireland an even greater share of total employment.</P>
        <P>Globally, Ireland is already punching above its weight in services trade. The Forf&aacute;s international trade and investment survey indicates that Irish services exports have increased 167% since 1999 compared to a more modest 25% increase in the trade in goods in the same period. Ireland had a 2.2% share of world services exports in 2004, out of all proportion to our share in world economic output.</P>
        <P>Despite these advances, many Irish services firms have not been able to take full advantage of some of the markets closest to us, as a true single market of services in Europe is still a pipe dream. Let us be honest, there has been much <Col N="114"/>rhetoric this evening. We are a long way from a true single market of services in Europe</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>We know services are an insurance for anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The legacy of 25 different regulatory regimes from 25 different legal systems has prevented this being achieved, despite the fact that the free provision of services and the freedom of establishment are enshrined in the Treaty of Rome of 1957. For large companies which can afford in-house legal teams, this is problematic but manageable. For small and medium size companies and enterprises, having to deal with the language barriers that trading in Europe entails is hard enough, without being lumbered with complex and unnecessary regulations.</P>
        <P>The rewards for Ireland and Europe of the successful negotiation of the services directive are huge. While consumers have benefited for years from a much greater choice of manufactured goods, the same cannot be said for many services. The entry by Bank of Scotland into the Irish banking market shows the potential gains for consumers in numerous other areas. Independent analyses conducted by European economic institutes suggest that a welfare gain of &euro;40 billion and 500,000 jobs is attainable from opening up the European services market. An economic analysis undertaken by Forf&aacute;s suggests gains in the order of &euro;450 million for Ireland.</P>
        <P>Many small and medium size Irish enterprises have the talent, energy and know-how to compete with the best in Europe. However, they are being constrained by onerous red tape or downright discriminatory regulations in other European countries, and would benefit significantly from the services directive, allowing access to a potential market of 450 million consumers.</P>
        <P>Commentators who continually bemoan the so-called rip-off Ireland cannot now object to every measure that is taken to try to open up Irish services to international competition. Firms such as Aer Lingus have gone through this painful process of competition and now offer a quality, competitive service supporting sustainable jobs. This experience can be repeated many times over on a smaller scale if a true single market in services in Europe is created.</P>
        <P>This is the context in which the services directive has emerged. Unfortunately, much confusion surrounds this directive because of its complexity. Its wide scope and complexity reflect the fact that it is rarely one regulation or law that dissuades companies from trading in other EU countries, but the cumulative effect of a plethora of regulations or red tape.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>So we are eejits. That is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The directive proposes to remove red tape by three measures. First, it proposes to <Col N="115"/>carry out a systematic trawl of existing regulations in all 25 European Union member states and weed out the regulations that are unduly restrictive or anti-competitive. Second, it aims to allow businesses to register as a business in another country electronically via a single point of contact.</P>
        <P>Third, the directive, as initiated, includes the country of origin provision in respect of enterprises which seek to deliver services in other member states but which do not wish to establish in them. This principle, which is based on the principle of mutual recognition, is already a cornerstone of the Single Market for goods. Goods that are deemed safe by the German or Czech Governments for their citizens can be sold in Ireland without having to be subjected to an entirely separate battery of costly checks and tests here. Similarly, the country of origin principle proposes that for a limited array of regulations relating to services provision, we should recognise German or Czech law as having broadly the same protective effect as Irish law without having to subject service providers to a separate set of checks and tests in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Various other provisions are included in the directive, in particular those concerning co-operation arrangements between supervisory authorities and consumer protection structures aimed at ensuring both good corporate governance and consumer protection standards. Somehow these provisions &mdash; on which I accept much work remains to be done &mdash; seem to be overlooked by the critics of the directive.</P>
        <P>We can have a very agitated debate about the country of origin principle, although this would amount to a great deal of wasted energy and hot air. All the indications are &mdash; and have been so for some months now &mdash; that the Commission intends to amend significantly that aspect of the directive. This only seems now to be getting through to the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is to be hoped we will do it in the European Parliament before then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;after getting themselves unnecessarily worked up about the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We had one document on which to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Even as the provision stood in the draft directive, many commentators &mdash; we were among them &mdash; and trade unions raised fears that the country of origin principle could lead to an erosion of standards, particularly in the matter of employment conditions and standards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>When?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="116"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>This was not an accurate interpretation of what was in the directive. There is a specific derogation from the country of origin principle for the posting of workers directive. In other words it is specifically the case that any employee sent to this country to deliver a service would have to work under Irish labour market conditions, including the minimum wage or other registered agreements, conditions of annual leave, working time and all other protections we take for granted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the ones I mentioned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Furthermore, the country of origin principle would not apply to health and safety conditions in the workplace, to which Deputy Harkin referred. In this context, Irish law would apply.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte said this would apply to the bogeyman company to which he constantly refers in public discourse by means of which Irish employers would set up a Latvian company with Latvian workers and send them over here to deliver a service. I should further add that if this mythical Latvian company were to open a branch or local office here &mdash; the majority of service companies which have ambitions to make inroads into the Irish market would almost certainly have to do so &mdash; then it would not be covered by the country of origin principle. To date, we have been active to ensure this is the case.</P>
        <P>We acknowledge that more work remains to be done in terms of amending the country of origin principle. We are concerned about protecting workers&rsquo; pay, conditions and living standards, which we have done so much to increase in this country. People like to refer to the Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy, as a bogeyman but as Minister for Finance he introduced policies which saw an unprecedented increase in jobs in this State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not his doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not anti-worker; he is pro-worker and the record exists for all to see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>He was not responsible for the job creation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We are as concerned as anyone else in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is he supporting the cheap labour bosses in Sweden then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with issues of standards, especially employment standards. This is why, for anyone who cares to look at the latest draft of the directive, one will see more than 300 footnotes of reservations, many of them from Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>How many?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="117"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 300 footnotes overall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of them are Irish?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>May I continue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>So the Minister agrees there is a problem. We are not idiots after all. There is a problem with the initial directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins should allow the Minister to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been saying that for a long time but without using the kind of rhetoric employed by the Deputy which he is deliberately using to appeal to constituents for electoral purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister accused us of being fools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the House that as we go through the negotiations we will embark on a consultative process with the stakeholders, a process which has been totally open and transparent, as anyone who has taken the trouble to visit my Department&rsquo;s website will see and as Deputy Harkin has done. I say this because we have been consistently posting on that site all the developments that have been taking place on the directive, as well as consistently calling for inputs from the stakeholders concerned. This is in addition to the numerous meetings my Department has had and will continue to have with stakeholders, including the social partners.</P>
        <P>Reference to a greater trade in services often leads to hostility. In part, this is understandable given the sensitive nature of some services, especially public services, and the difficulty in controlling quality in service provision. However, the calls for opposing liberalisation in services often closely mirror the protectionist arguments against the creation of a single market in goods two decades ago.</P>
        <P>We must be careful to draw a line between genuine fears of a lowering of standards on the one hand and short-sighted protectionism by a myriad of interest groups on the other. I encourage all involved to engage in an intelligent debate on the services directive that focuses on what it proposes to do rather than inaccurately fault it for every perceived ill of globalisation. As of now, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. That is the position of every country involved in the process to date.</P>
        <P>We are a small island nation that depends on trade to create our wealth and we export 85% of everything we produce. The same applies to services. We need access to markets in Europe and throughout the world. That has always been a bottom line in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, especially since we shed our protectionist attitude of earlier decades. From the 1960s onwards we have been outward looking and have <Col N="118"/>sought to access markets. In the context of social partnership we have built up an extensive social protection model in this country. We have increased living standards dramatically over the past decade. The Government can be trusted to continue this twin-track approach in terms of expanding Irish wealth, improving living standards and improving conditions for Irish workers. The rewards in terms of improved standards of living for all Irish citizens will be significant if we succeed in building a true single market for services in Europe.</P>

	<P>The European Commission proposal for a directive on services in the Internal Market is one of the most ambitious proposals for regulatory reform undertaken in the European Union. It has the goal of creating a real and genuine internal market in services. Up to now, it has not been possible to exploit the great potential for economic growth and job creation afforded by the services sector because of the many obstacles obstructing the development of the sector across the 25 member states of the EU.</P>
        <P>A study undertaken by Forf&aacute;s shows that the annual benefit to Ireland of the directive could be greater than &euro;400 million. This benefit would come in the form of savings to Irish consumers due to the fact that previously sheltered sectors would face competition from abroad. Further benefits would come from the opening of the markets of other EU member states to Irish service providers. This was a key theme in the report of the enterprise strategy group chaired by Eoin O&rsquo;Driscoll. Potential growth sectors identified in the O&rsquo;Driscoll report include private education, intellectual property, international sales and marketing, supply chain and management, and professional and consultancy services.</P>
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce, I take encouragement from the work done by Forf&aacute;s and the enterprise strategy group. As the Minister stated, Ireland is already punching above its weight in services trade and the adoption of a fair and balanced services directive would ensure that we would continue to do so by removing barriers to trade within the EU. The target now is to provide the legal certainty that will allow consumers and producers to take full advantage of the major opportunities opened up by the creation of free movement of services between member states, a principle already enshrined in the European treaty.</P>
        <P>There have been two main aspects to the Government&rsquo;s approach to the consideration of the Commission proposal, both of equal importance. We want to see a regulatory framework that allows a services market without barriers to become a reality, as well as a regulatory framework that provides for the appropriate controls to be put in place to uphold the rights and obli<Col N="119"/>gations of all citizens. This is a major yet crucial task.</P>
        <P>The history of this proposal is clouded in controversy, most of it undeserved but arising probably from poor presentation, inadequate examination and huge complexity but also, in some cases, deliberate misrepresentation, political opportunism and downright scaremongering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Here we go again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that this proposal offers great opportunity and that it raises major difficulties and complications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is scaremongering?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The vast array of interests that could be affected by the proposal, the plethora of regulation and controls that need to be removed or amended, combine to ensure that its passage through the EU institutions will be lengthy and complicated. That is why the Government&rsquo;s approach to the draft directive has been cautious and careful. We want to see the benefits of a real internal market in services but we must have in place the appropriate standards, particularly employment standards, to regulate it.</P>
        <P>Since the draft directive was tabled by the European Commission in 2004, during the last Irish Presidency of the EU, detailed work has been undertaken in the Council, examining in precise detail every aspect of the proposal, article by article. The Council working group met on a regular basis, sometimes as frequently as every other week, to consider different aspects of the proposal. On a regular basis over this period, Ministers meeting in the Competitiveness Council reviewed the work and issued guidelines for the ongoing examination. While this work was going on in Brussels, officials of my Department were engaging in detailed and widespread consultation with all interested parties in Ireland to gather their reaction to the proposal. The widest possible consultation was carried out among professional, trade, employer, employee and consumer organisations, and views were invited from all sources. The views and information gathered in this way were used to inform our input into work at EU level. The result of that work, as we await the outcome of the deliberations of the European Parliament, is a revised draft proposal which runs to 123 pages and contains 338 footnotes, indicating serious concerns of, and amendments sought by, member states, a significant number from Ireland.</P>
        <P>We have raised issues relating to the scope of the directive and have requested clarification of the wording of the exclusion of public services. We have raised issues relating to the country of origin principle, how it would work and how consumers would benefit from its provisions. We have raised concerns about the rules under which <Col N="120"/>service companies would be able to establish in other member states. We want to ensure that the procedures are workable and established over a reasonable timeframe.</P>
        <P>We have concerns about the introduction of mandatory insurance for service providers, mainly because further work needs to be done to assess the practicality of this proposal. We also have concerns about the mechanisms by which member states would co-operate with each other to ensure adequate supervision of service providers who are availing of the Single Market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have dwelled at some length on the process which has been and is under way, at national and European levels, to stress the care which is being taken by all member states, including Ireland, to get this project right and to ensure that the end result is the correct one from every point of view. As I mentioned, the next step is a vote in the matter by the European Parliament next month. Depending on the result of that vote, it will then be a matter for the Commission to consider tabling a new proposal. In that situation, the Government will re-engage with the interested parties in Ireland to get their views on any new proposal. That exercise will be no less comprehensive than the one carried out so far and I hope it will be accompanied by as extensive a public debate as possible on the issues involved and how they affect our future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent debate in Ireland on the draft services directive has become mixed up, in a somewhat confused way, with the whole question of labour standards and migrant workers. In his contribution, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, dealt extensively with these issues, but I would like to say a few words about employment standards, compliance with them and their enforcement.</P>
        <P>The rights of workers from overseas are established by legislation as being equal to those of Irish workers. The vast majority of overseas workers have an entirely satisfactory interaction with the Irish labour market, one that is beneficial to all sides and the economy in general. However, there are instances in which overseas workers have not been getting their entitlements in certain sectors and particularly in cases where they may be relatively isolated. It was for this reason that the Government increased the number of labour inspectors last March to an all-time high of 31. These inspectors are in place, have completed their initial training and are now conducting inspections. More needs to be done with regard to the promotion of employment rights entitlements to employers, to employees and to migrant workers in particular. I have no doubt that these issues will continue to be discussed by the Government and the social partners in the context of partnership talks and indeed subsequently. It is important therefore to separate issues of enforcement of our employment law from the creation of a single market in services. which will not impact on that law.</P><Col N="121"/>
        <P>In the ten years since the completion of the Single Market programme in 1993, more than 2.5 million jobs have been created in the EU as a result of the removal of barriers to trade. The European Commission has calculated that the increase in wealth attributable to the Internal Market in those ten years is nearly &euro;900 billion. Competition has increased, prices have converged and the range and quality of products available to consumers has increased. However, despite some progress in specific sectors, the internal market for services is not yet working as well as it should or as well as it can. Most of the benefit seen so far from the Internal Market has occurred in the goods market. The need to make a serious effort on the services sector front has been evident for some time. The proposal for a directive on services is the opportunity to do something about it and it is an opportunity we should not miss.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this motion tabled by the Independent Deputies. I was surprised at the innocuous content of the amendment to the motion tabled by the Government, and given the reasonable nature of the motion, I was surprised the Government could not agree with its contents. There is very little difference between the motion and the amendment. The motion would have been a strong declaration of intent on behalf of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to say to the European Commission and Parliament that Ireland was at one with regard to the amendments required and changes necessary to the present drafting of the EU services directive.</P>
        <P>The EU services directive is very important legislation currently going before the European Parliament. At its heart is the nature of our common market, one which has served this country exceptionally well. It seeks to provide consumers with choice, to root out inefficiency and to promote competition. For all those reasons, Fine Gael supports the need for a common position on EU services. Unfortunately, its needless country of origin principle makes the directive unacceptable in its current form. There is much to be welcomed in the directive. We believe the country of origin principle will be removed in time and that the directive will, in a new form, become law.</P>
        <P>Many in this House and outside are using one part of the directive, which has no hope of being passed, to overlook some of its positive elements. The draft services directive will be of great benefit to Europe and Ireland. It will help boost economic growth and sustainable jobs. Since 1993 the Internal Market has created much prosperity and employment in this jurisdiction. It can deliver much more if we can create a real internal market for services. It will make it easier for businesses, especially small and medium size businesses, to provide services throughout the EU. This will increase cross-border competition in service <Col N="122"/>markets, bringing down prices and improving quality and choice for consumers.</P>
        <P>Some time ago, to reduce prices and create greater competition in the insurance market, Fine Gael proposed to the Government that we should bring about a situation where the completion of the Internal Market would allow Irish consumers to shop around the European Union to get cheaper prices at a time when they had increased enormously between 1999 and 2005.</P>
        <P>The proposed EU services directive would also remove pointless red tape, by simplifying the authorisation and licensing regimes with which businesses must comply. Business would be able to complete any necessary formalities electronically and through one point of contact. It would improve co-operation between national authorities in different member states to protect and inform consumers and to combat rogue operators or illegal work. It would help stop discrimination against consumers on grounds of nationality. For example, different entry fees to museums or cultural events could not be imposed on tourists on the basis of their nationality.</P>
        <P>It would clarify the conditions under which patients are entitled to reimbursement for medical care obtained in another member state to ensure that patients can benefit from a better choice of high-quality treatment. We would also see better exchange of information and closer co-operation would replace the current wasteful duplication of national regulations and controls.</P>
        <P>Some things would not happen if the directive were introduced. It would not force member states to liberalise or privatise public services or open them up to competition. The directive would not affect the freedom of member states to define what they consider to be public services or services of general economic interest, or to decide how they should be organised and financed. The directive would not change the way member states choose to organise health and social security systems. It would not allow companies to bring in cheap workers from other member states. The proposal leaves unchanged the rule that a service company posting workers to another member state applies that member state&rsquo;s employment conditions, including minimum wages, to avoid social dumping. It would not endanger the protection of health and safety conditions or social security we have in this jurisdiction. National governments would continue to have sovereignty over a range of issues that would not be included in the draft EU services directive.</P>
        <P>However, Fine Gael has a difficulty with the country of origin principle. The Deputies in the Technical Group have clearly set out how this would have an impact on Irish conditions. We do not want to end up with two tiers of workers. Either we have a minimum wage or we do not. Either we have health and safety regulations or we do not. With the country of origin principle, I am not sure whether that situation arises. We cannot say that we are in the business of equality <Col N="123"/>if we allow for one worker doing the same work to be paid twice as much simply on the basis of where he or she grew up.</P>
        <P>I note that SIPTU has stated that the European Trade Union Confederation has protested that the directive would allow companies registered in EU member states with minimum labour standards to undercut the higher standards, including pay and conditions, secured by workers in other member states. The directive would also allow an Irish company to re-establish itself in a low-standards member state and then return to operate in Ireland with these lower standards. Worse still, any checks to ensure that the workers employed by these service companies even complied with the low legal standards required by the country of origin would be the responsibility of the country of origin rather than the member state in which the service company was operating. Even the enforcement of these minimal standards would be practically impossible.</P>
        <P>I am in favour of competition and in our various campaigns, particularly since November 2003, Fine Gael has advocated the importance of having the free movement of goods services and labour in the context of the completion of the Single Market. I already referred to insurance and in many other service areas, Irish consumers, because of our geographical location and our small market, are not able to benefit from the possible savings we could make across a wide range of goods and services by the completion of that market. During campaigning for the referenda on many treaties, the Irish consumer was promised on many occasions that savings would accrue from the larger Union of 450 million people. Through the completion of the Internal Market it should be possible to make progress and achieve savings in many of these services on which small businesses and consumers feel they are being ripped off.</P>
        <P>This part of the directive which seeks to engage in the country of origin principle is not the way forward and it needs to be changed. On behalf of Fine Gael, through its membership of the largest grouping in the European Parliament, the European People&rsquo;s Party, I will play my part to make the views of this House known and we will use our political influence in that context to ensure that changes and amendments are made to the draft services directive. It will require clout at that level to implement such changes.</P>
        <P>The motion is right to contextualise this issue in terms of the recent disgraceful goings on at Irish Ferries and Gama. That a former State company in the shape of Irish Ferries would resort to such Dickensian tactics to cut costs without the slightest concern for Irish workers whose livelihoods it was destroying is nothing short of scandalous and whatever captains of industry decided that this was a good idea should be ashamed of themselves. The developments in Irish Ferries were significant not just because of <Col N="124"/>those whom they directly affected. Every employee in the country was looking at Irish Ferries and saying that it could have been him or her.</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased that the recent agreement worked out by Irish Ferries and the trade union movement through the Labour Court intervention ensured that situation was averted. It was not appropriate, through the country of origin principle, for Irish workers to be displaced by foreign workers who would be abused and exploited by not being paid Irish rates of pay. I accept that maritime law played a major part in this case. However, clarification of the Irish Ferries dispute was important for many workers who felt undermined and hopeless if such a situation took hold. We, in this House, have a duty to ensure that situation does not recur.</P>
        <P>In May 2005 it became known that Irish Ferries was one of the main beneficiaries of the so-called tonnage tax scheme. It saved an estimated &euro;3 million in tax payments in 2003, the first year of the scheme&rsquo;s operation. When a company is getting such considerable support from the taxpayer, it should have respect for Irish workers and not treat them in the manner it did. I hope the new social partnership agreement, negotiations on which will begin soon, will play a part in ensuring we have proper employment standards.</P>
        <P>Similarly with Gama Construction, revelations regarding foreign workers are shameful. I sincerely hope that the labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for any impropriety, exploitation and fraud that may have taken place. Such companies should be brought to heel by the laws to ensure that we have an even playing pitch for all companies and the highest level of worker standards.</P>
        <P>The finding of a recent survey indicating a majority of voters claimed they supported the reintroduction of work permits for eastern European workers is hardly surprising. There is an inherent prejudice and racism inbuilt in the Irish psyche, which is regrettable, misplaced and unfair. We require information campaigns and education to deal with this problem. Fine Gael believes the country should be upfront and honest about the need for immigration, the benefits it can bring and the repercussions for our economy of not welcoming inward migration.</P>
        <P>Ireland will need to import the skills needed to ensure that we remain a world-class player. The economy has the potential to post cumulative growth of 45% in the next ten years, which will require more labour. We will not be able to sustain that economic development ourselves and based on a Goodbody Stockbrokers assessment, I do not believe the birth rate will increase the population to the extent that we can supply all those workers ourselves. I do not see us reverting to pre-television days and having very large families again. We undoubtedly need more immigrant workers. To those who say otherwise, I ask <Col N="125"/>how we will find people to staff our public services and service industries without those people. We must ensure that we integrate these people into Irish society.</P>
        <P>We all know people or have family members, perhaps ourselves, who were directly affected by the fact that we are former emigrants. The last people in the world who should be afraid of globalisation are the Irish. At a time when our economic conditions were not good, our people were beneficiaries in terms of economic and social well being by the fact that we had the United Kingdom or United States willing to absorb our family members, who played a major part in building those economies. Ireland has been enriched by many of these people who have returned, established small and major businesses and have had a considerable influence externally on foreign direct investment in this country. We should also ensure that we take a societal view of our migrants, not just an economic view. This is where we may have been falling down over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>The services directive as it stands will act as a disincentive for outside labour to come here, which is why some changes are required. The very reason that many EU nationals view Ireland as an attractive place to work and live is the high rate of pay. We are going up the value chain in the view of Mr. Se&aacute;n Dorgan, who regularly mentions it. Some people going up the value chain are doing so due to enhanced educational provision. We should be mindful that not everyone participates in the educational process. Too many people drop out of the education system and have poor literacy skills. State intervention is required to ensure that people stay longer in the education system and benefit from going up the value chain.</P>
        <P>The high cost of living here cancels many of the positive factors in many cases but Ireland&rsquo;s minimum wage, which I fully support, is certainly a pull factor when it comes to attracting people here. We have very little hope of continuing to attract the necessary supply of, for example,<?oasys _jy ?>Polish workers if all we have to offer them are the same wages and conditions they get at home. I sincerely doubt many of them will come here simply for the Guinness.</P>
        <P>The motion refers to &ldquo;the need to promote social solidarity as a core value between EU citizens&rdquo;. As a European and as a member of a pro-European party that has always supported the value of the European Union, even when others in this House were portraying it as some sort of bogeyman, I fully subscribe to that view.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU ensured that we were not all just a collection of workers toiling to feed an economy but were rather a collection of citizens whose economy worked for our society. It was Europe that dragged Ireland into line on issues such as workers&rsquo; rights, health and safety protections, equality for women and a raft of other anti-discrimination measures. That is what makes the country of origin principle so disappointing.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that our international reputation took another hit last month when the Polish edition of <i>Newsweek </i>reported that Ireland was a &ldquo;living hell&rdquo; for some Poles who arrived expecting to be able to pick and choose jobs because of misinformation but instead found themselves sleeping rough and living on charity. The Polish Embassy has suggested that approximately 10,000 Polish people living in this country are experiencing difficulty. The country of origin principle will only make this situation worse.</P>
        <P>That said, I hope that those who are using the country of origin principle as a stick with which to beat the EU will desist. I also appeal to those who rightly oppose the country of origin principle not to let it blind them to the very good aspects contained in the services directive. I hope the electorate will not be fooled by those who are ideologically opposed to the EU, to competition, to free markets and to consumers&rsquo; rights into thinking that everything they say on this issue can be trusted.</P>
        <P>Ireland is the very last country in the world that should be afraid of globalisation. Given our history, Ireland has nothing to fear. Open markets have given us jobs, prosperity and ended the twin scourges of unemployment and emigration. Ultimately, I am in favour of the harmonisation of EU labour law if we have proper minimum rates of pay, a properly resourced labour inspectorate and proper worker health and safety legislation in place. A harmonised labour law would end the misery of millions of workers in poorer countries where protections are minimal.</P>
        <P>It is worth remembering that the country of origin principle is largely credited with defeating the European constitution in the referenda in France and the Netherlands. The repercussions are that important. It threatens to undermine support for the European Union in general and unless Europe and this Government listen to the people who have expressed fears in this regard, they will lose their trust and support.</P>
        <P>I am heartened by the news that a substantial number of amendments have been tabled to the directive. I understand there are 1,500. However, I fear that the ongoing debate at the higher echelons of the Union is giving the distinct impression that the EU cares too much about the <Col N="127"/>interests of big business and not enough about workers. We must attain the appropriate balance in order to bring the citizens of Europe with us on this particular issue to achieve the necessary savings for European consumers without damaging the standards we have all aspired to and ensuring that our protections for consumers and workers are in line with the motion&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not feel it appropriate to accept the motion and send the unanimous message of the House to the European Parliament and to the Commission that Ireland is in favour of a services directive but that changes are necessary, particular in respect of the country of origin principle, if it is to meet Irish conditions.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for selecting this matter and welcome the fact that a female Minister of State is present. I hope she will speak with her Cabinet and Government colleagues on this issue, which relates to women. A number of women have found themselves in a situation that goes back to the hepatitis case, women who have all the symptoms of hepatitis but have not been diagnosed.</P>
        <P>What happened in the first instance was scandalous. Let us not have a second scandal. Very few women, perhaps 100 or fewer, are affected. I know some of them myself and it is sad to see the way in which they and their families have suffered and how they have been treated by the State, which has created a great injustice for them. Many people are still walking free in this country and I hope the courts will one day deal with those who have upset so many families in respect of hepatitis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has held a number of meetings with Positive Action and I hope it will concede to the people who have been affected by the green card &mdash; the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 card &mdash; which would entitle those women to free health services, drugs, pharmacy services, home help and other specialised services they need and will need in future. I call on the Government to give the card to these women as a gesture. Simply due to the fact that it does not show in a test &mdash; they have all the symptoms &mdash; they should not need to fight any more. Many of them are currently fighting for their lives due to what has happened to them. Give them that small bit of back up, that small bit of help. There was never as much money or resources in the State. This would mean much for 100 or fewer women.</P><Col N="128"/>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is a woman and has met these groups. I hope she will take the correct decision, not next year but now. They want it now. It is not an issue I like bringing up but is one that must be raised. These women have no one to speak for them as they comprise such a small group. The Government must end this matter immediately. The women are entitled to what they are looking for.</P>
        <P>It is saddening when such people come and talk to one. I know some of them as they are my neighbours and I have seen how some women have suffered, how their health seems to have worsened over the years. I hope the Government will make the correct decision quickly. I hope we do not have the situation that occurred before, where people had to fight for their rights and fight for their lives. If fewer than 100 women are affected by this the Government should immediately give them the blue card and whatever else is needed to deal with their health problems. I hope this will be done quickly as it is wrong that such women must have meetings with the Minister for Health and Children. These women have suffered enough and this problem was not created by them. Rather, it was created by this State yet nobody has paid the price for it. I hope the people who created the problem for women will suffer because some women in this country have lost their lives.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister can provide a positive response as this is an emotive issue and we do not wish to play politics with it. This matter concerns women&rsquo;s health and lives and the effect on many families in the State. I call on the Minister for Health and Children to put the resources and money in place and provide these people with the blue card. They would prefer to have their health but that was taken from them by the State and I call on the State to do what is right for these women.</P>

	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. The T&aacute;naiste has asked me to inform the House that the Department of Health and Children has regular contact with the group referred to by the Deputy. The T&aacute;naiste has had one meeting with them, in February 2005, at which this issue was discussed.</P>
        <P>The services referred to by Deputy Ring are provided under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. A decision regarding the entitlement of an individual to services under the 1996 Act rests with the chief officer of the Health Service Executive. Eligible persons are given a Health (Amendment) Act card, sometimes referred to as a blue card. Eligible persons are persons who, in the opinion of the chief officer, have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of anti-D, or the administration of blood or blood <Col N="129"/>products within the State. Eligibility is determined on an individual basis, and applies for the lifetime of the eligible person. An application for services is made on a standard form available from one of the hepatitis C liaison officers in each Health Service Executive region.</P>
        <P>The guidelines for establishment of eligibility have been set out by the Department of Health and Children, in accordance with the recommendations of the expert group on hepatitis C. Membership of the expert group includes the group referred to by Deputy Ring.</P>
        <P>To establish eligibility the following conditions need to be met: proof of a positive hepatitis C test result, including at a minimum, a positive ELISA, antibody, test result; and proof that the infection resulted from blood or blood products administered within the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of an extension of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 to provide free health care for the cohort of patients referred to by the Deputy has been carefully examined and advice taken from a number of relevant sources. The exact number of women affected is not known. While the T&aacute;naiste is sympathetic to the patients in question, she cannot support an extension to the current eligibility requirements. This position was signalled to the group at her meeting with them in February 2005. Following further analysis of the matter the T&aacute;naiste confirmed her decision to the group in September 2005.</P>

I am grateful for the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to respond to my concerns, shared by many in the Cork region but particularly those representing the Cork city area. The Minister of State may be aware that the previous Minister at his Department visited this company, GN Resound, at the end of 2002. The T&aacute;naiste launched an expansion of activities at the company to expand the range of manufacturing, the types of products and the types of jobs available at the plant.</P>
        <P>While that was welcomed by those who wish to see the development of economic matters in the Cork region, it is disturbing to note that since then the company has decided to move its manufacturing operations to China. This is indicative of a trend in many manufacturing industries. The Minister of State may feel pleased with news pertinent to his constituency announced this week. While announcements of new jobs in the regions are always welcomed, the distribution of such jobs and the industries they are in is something of which we must take greater cognisance.</P>
        <P>The Cork area is reliant on the pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology areas. The announcement in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constitu<Col N="130"/>ency is a further example of this. The region has seen a sad deterioration in high-tech, electronic manufacturing in recent years. The technology park in which GN Resound is based, on Model Farm Road, Bishopstown, on the outskirts of the city, is a sad testament to how that aspect of industrial development is not working as well as it could. The technology park has a number of empty units due to similar decisions by companies involved in manufacturing, particularly electronics. Some closed their operations for economic reasons and some for the reasons announced by GN Resound, namely, that profitability could be better obtained in a country with different economic circumstances where the workforce is prepared to be paid less.</P>
        <P>The Government must decide to what extent such decisions represent a trend. What other type of manufacturing industry are we prepared to see leave our shores in coming years because of the effect of globalisation? It is not acceptable for the Minister of State to reply that we have high employment in this country or that announcements have been made for the Cork region in the past few days.</P>
        <P>We must offer an industrial development policy that is varied, for the sake of workers with different skills in this economy, but also because we cannot become over-reliant on any one industry in the event of that industry being subject to economic factors in the future. We are placing all eggs in one basket and this may cause difficulties later. For the people who will lose their jobs at this company in April, what the Minister of State is likely to state in his reply, concerning high employment and recent job announcements, does not cut ice.</P>
        <P>Besides the fact that people have been put in a disadvantageous employment situation, the company&rsquo;s product, hearing aids, is no longer made in this country. This will have implications for imports if this situation is repeated in other industries. Trade will be affected as well as employment. I am interested in the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in response to this.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Boyle for raising this matter. GN Resound announced to its staff on 19 January 2006 that it would cease operations in Cork with the loss of 180 jobs. The company had informed IDA Ireland of this decision ten days earlier. I am conscious of the adverse effect the announcement of the closure of this company will have on the workers and their families, as well as the community. Our first thoughts are for the workforce and their families. This is extremely disappointing news, coming so early in the new year, for those who will lose their jobs as a result of the announcement. I assure the people affected that <Col N="131"/>the State agencies will give every support and the priority will be to find alternative employment tor those involved. The role of F&Aacute;S, the State training agency, will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs. F&Aacute;S will provide advice and training opportunities for the GN Resound workforce as well as making its full range of services available to all the workers.</P>
        <P>GN Resound, a subsidiary of Danish telecommunications firm GN Great Nordic, is a hearing health care company that designs, develops, manufactures and markets technologically advanced hearing devices, digital hearing instruments, analog instruments and audiological equipment. I understand that the decision by the company to cease activities in Cork is part of a broadly based plan to consolidate its standard manufacturing and distribution into China and Denmark. The company&rsquo;s corporate headquarters relocated from the United States to Denmark some years ago.</P>
        <P>The manufacturing element in Cork, which employs 120 people, will transfer to China, while the remaining activities, which include a global distribution centre, customer service and new production introduction pilot manufacture will transfer back to the company&rsquo;s headquarters in Denmark. The timeframe for the completion of these activities is for manufacturing to cease by 31 March 2006 and global distribution, customer service and new production introduction to cease by 30 April 2006. However, a small number of key staff members will remain at the company for a number of months. I understand that the company will offer a six week redundancy package, inclusive of statutory redundancy, plus three months health care insurance, together with an outplacement service and the establishment of an internal staff resource centre for all staff members. I trust that this will help to ease the burden on the workers affected in what is a non-union site.</P>
        <P>Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for the State development agencies. I assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland as well as F&Aacute;S will play their part in developing a way forward. However, on a positive note, yesterday the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, announced that Amgen, the largest biotechnology company in the world, has chosen Carrigtwohill, County Cork, for major new development and manufacturing investment projects. Supported by IDA Ireland, Amgen will invest more than $1 billion, equal to &euro;820 million, in the projects and will employ more than 1,100 people in Cork by 2010. This investment is a symbol of Cork&rsquo;s, and Ireland&rsquo;s, ability to compete and win the most advanced and innovative business, coming as it does from such a big player in the biotechnology area.</P>
        <P>In addition, Citco, the independent global financial services organisation and one of the <Col N="132"/>world&rsquo;s leading providers of hedge fund services, will open a second Irish hedge fund administration centre in Cork and is to expand its existing data processing operation in Cork. These two developments by Citco will create more than 250 new jobs during the next four years. There were also announcements in December last by VMware, Alps Electric Company Limited and Parsons of investments and job creation in Cork city and county.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the State development agencies, under the auspices of the Department, will continue to work closely together and with local interests to promote Cork city and county for further investment and job creation. However, I accept that this will in no way detract from the immediate concerns and needs of the workers in GN Resound.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this serious matter concerning my constituents in south Tipperary. Why has the waiting period for driving tests grown longer since 2005 and what does the Minister propose to do to alleviate the unacceptably long waiting periods for driving tests in Tipperary town and Clonmel?</P>
        <P>In Tipperary town the pass rate for driving tests is 48.9% and in Clonmel the pass rate is 51.5%. This means that in both towns approximately half of all applicants fail and must then wait for another 12 months before they can repeat the test. This is unacceptable, particularly to many of the young people who live in the area and who travel to Cork or Limerick on a daily basis. Many of them approached me to explain their case for having a driving test moved forward. Their livelihoods and jobs are dependent on having a driving licence.</P>
        <P>It returns to the ongoing problem we have had for a long time. In 2004, 370 people died on Irish roads. This figure rose to 399 in 2005. Already in 2006, 29 people are dead. Last weekend alone nine people lost their lives. Addressing the carnage on our roads requires a multifaceted approach. Improving our driving testing services is an important component of any solution. This afternoon the Taoiseach described the high number of road deaths as disappointing. What is needed now is action. I hope the Minister will deal with this important issue for my constituents, which has been ongoing for a long number of years. I hope the Minister of State will be positive in her response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport acknowledges the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the waiting lists in the Tipperary town and Clonmel test centres. On 23 January the longest waiting time in Clonmel was 51 weeks compared to 50 last December and in Tipperary town it was 58 weeks compared to 55 last December. While the Minister fully accepts that waiting times for driv<Col N="133"/>ing tests in general are unacceptable, the increase in these centres in January was due to some of the testers based in these regions being on annual leave over Christmas and the new year. The Minister anticipates that the waiting times in these centres will improve in the short term.</P>
        <P>Regarding waiting times in general at present 127,000 candidates await a driving test. Since 1998 the driver testing corps has been increased from 66 to 113 to deal with the additional workload. In addition, retired testers have been engaged and testers continue to work overtime. The Minister for Transport, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, has developed a package of measures to deal with the backlog of driving tests. It is the intention of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to reduce the driver testing backlog by 80,000 by June 2007. To this end a package of measures was proposed which included a bonus scheme for driver testers, recruitment of an additional ten testers and the outsourcing of a batch of 40,000 tests.</P>
        <P>The testing and recruitment process of the proposed ten contract testers is under way in the Public Appointments Service and 89 driver testers have signed up for the bonus scheme which is due to commence on 6 February. This is expected to deliver approximately 30,000 tests based on the commitment given. The tendering process for the outsourcing of tests has been completed and a preferred tender has been selected. No contract has yet been awarded as the matter has been the subject of conciliation at the Labour Relations Commission as unions consider the proposed outsourcing to be in breach of Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>Agreement was reached at the LRC under which it was agreed that the Department of Transport would seek expressions of interest from surplus staff within the Department of Agriculture and Food for temporary redeployment as driver testers. A minimum number of 25 additional staff was required. The Department of Transport has processed the applications received and this week will interview the shortlist of ten, following which the successful candidates will be trained as driver testers. The agreement also provided that in the event of the proposal proving to be undeliverable at any stage the Department would take measures to address the backlog. My understanding is that the Department continues to pursue all options to ensure that the backlog is reduced as quickly as possible. I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue yet again on the adjournment of the D&aacute;il. It is with deep regret and dismay that I must return to this issue, namely, the provision of school transport to a group of pupils in Blackwater, County Wexford, part of my constituency, to enable them to go to the school of their choice in Wexford. I outlined <Col N="134"/>the case&rsquo;s details to the D&aacute;il last November. Since then, unimaginable hurdles and obstacles of every sort have been put in the way of these children and their families. This issue has been characterised by confusion in the past weeks. I am grateful that the Minister of State is present tonight and am optimistic that her presence, as the Minister responsible, will finally bring an end to the tortuous route to which the parents and children of this area have been put in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>A variety of maps have been produced indicating that some or all of the children are within the catchment area. A variety of maps have conjured up divisions between the VEC, which is the Department&rsquo;s agent in transport, Bus &Eacute;ireann, which is the Department&rsquo;s provider, and the Department itself. It is now time for honesty and clarity. Over the decades,the Department&rsquo;s agent, the VEC, has determined eligibility for at least some of the pupils in question. I have a letter to hand dated 5 November 2005, in which the transport liaison officer, Clare McMahon, wrote to the parents and stated that as transport liaison officer, she had requested transport for 23 eligible students from the Blackwater area.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, for some inexplicable reason, the Department of Education and Science has stepped into this matter directly. It does not do so in every other area, and I do not know why it did so in this case. It claims to have a different map. I requested a copy of it and I have it to hand. However, it makes no sense. The official map has a line on it which terminates in the middle of a field. Hence, it cannot be an official map. The confusion between various maps has been the catalyst for the wild goose chase that has frustrated parents. In a freedom of information request which was answered today, the school planning section of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, in a letter to one of the parents, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">As per our conversation today, 25 January 2006, in relation to Wexford catchment area maps, I wish to clarify the following points. The map which I sent you under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 is the only map which the Department of Education and Science uses when dealing with issues relating to catchment areas... There is no map in relation to post-primary catchment areas... There is no dedicated map relating to post-primary catchment areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The appeal that was lodged &mdash; that was the suggested route &mdash; was summarily dismissed, although even the most regressive and restrictive reading of the official map &mdash; one of the three &mdash; which the Department states to be its own, indicates that at least some of the pupils are within the catchment area.</P>
        <P>I have a letter from Bus &Eacute;ireann, indicating two boundaries. One may take one&rsquo;s pick as to which line has official status. One would imagine that the agent of the Department, that is, the VEC, which has been operating from its map for 40 years and which operates everywhere else in <Col N="135"/>the county, would have its judgments and its determination of eligibility for at least 23 of these pupils upheld by the Department.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has read the file and has met a deputation. She has spoken to the pupils and has had the opportunity to reflect on this matter. I ask her to end this tortuous process, to intervene personally and take an initiative that will allow the bulk of these pupils, who are clearly eligible under the school transport scheme, transport to their school of choice. I hope the Minister will bring an end to this ongoing frustration and will provide relief to these parents and children tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I welcome this opportunity to outline to the House my Department&rsquo;s position regarding school transport for children residing in the Blackwater area of County Wexford. By way of general comment, I should explain that one of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from schools and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.</P>
        <P>More than 135,000 primary and post primary pupils use the school transport scheme on a regular basis. Expenditure for school transport in 2005 was more than &euro;122 million. The allocation for 2006 is &euro;152 million, a 30% increase on that of last year. It includes funding towards the cost of a comprehensive package of measures which I announced last year to address the phasing out of the three for two seating arrangement on school buses.</P>
        <P>I now wish to focus on the specific issue of transport for children attending post-primary schools. For the purposes of post primary education provision, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. Under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme, pupils are eligible for transport if they reside 4.8 km, approximately three miles, or more from the post primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside.</P>

	<P>This is identical to the speech given on 22 November.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, I have found that to be the position, which is why I take the opportunity to highlight the rules on such occasions. Eligible pupils who wish to attend post primary schools in another catchment area may be allowed transport on school services from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended, subject to there being spare seats available on the school transport service and at no additional cost to the State. The pupils themselves are responsible for getting to the catchment boundary or to the nearest school bus service within that catchment area.</P>
        <P>Eligible pupils who are approved for catchment boundary transport are not guaranteed school transport for the duration of their education at that centre. As a concessionary measure, continued transport will depend on the availability of spare seats on the school service to that centre each school term.</P>
        <P>In regard to the specific issue of transport for children from the Blackwater area of County Wexford, my Department&rsquo;s school transport section is satisfied on the basis of the map held in the Department, which is the definitive map&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the map with the line going into the middle of a field.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that the children in question are not fully eligible for transport to schools in Wexford town. Furthermore, Bus &Eacute;ireann has informed my Department that there are not enough spare seats available on the buses to facilitate the pupils in question with catchment boundary transport to Wexford town.</P>
        <P>A number of families from the Blackwater area recently appealed my Department&rsquo;s decision to the independent school transport appeals board. The board upheld my Department&rsquo;s decision in the matter. The Deputy&rsquo;s question seems to imply that my Department denied the appeal. I want to make it clear that the school transport appeals board is independent of my Department and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in cases which have been considered by the board.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 139 together.</P>
        <P>The objective of the group broadband scheme is to promote the roll out of broadband access through the establishment of sustainable broadband services in towns, villages, rural hinterlands and under-served areas of larger towns on the basis of local and regional authority coordination and community driven initiatives.</P>
        <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>Two successful calls have been launched to date. Under the first call, 34 projects were approved and they were designed to deliver broadband to 38 communities with a combined population of over 36,000 people. This represented a capital investment of over &euro;1.4 million in these areas.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>To date, my Department has been advised that 24 projects are now operational under the first call with projected customer base of approximately 1,500 subscribers. Over &euro;590,000 was committed in grant aid to these projects and to date the grantees have drawn down &euro;246,000. As these projects are nearing the end of their first year my Department is expecting to receive the outstanding grant claims over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Under the second call, a total of 128 projects were approved and they were designed to deliver broadband to 537 communities with a combined population of 384,000 people. This represents a capital investment of almost &euro;14 million in these <Col N="138"/>areas. To date, my Department has been advised that 24 projects have been launched and many of the other projects are currently at a test stage or nearing full operational capability. Of the second call projects launched, the service providers have projected a customer base of approximately 2,670 subscribers. The various project teams are working to make this a reality.</P>
        <P>More than &euro;5.3 million has been committed in grant aid to the second call projects and to date the grantees have drawn down &euro;135,000. As the approved projects mature over the coming months it is expected that there will be a significant upturn in available broadband services and in subscriber numbers. The innovative group broadband scheme has captured the imagination of rural areas. It has given many communities which heretofore felt isolated from modern telecommunications developments an actual opportunity to access broadband facilities. The group broadband scheme is evolving day by day and as it rolls out across the country the benefits of this technology is becoming more apparent to communities. I have been listening to the many communities which were not sufficiently mobilised to avail of the first and second call and there is still a demand for broadband in rural areas.</P>
        <P>To address this issue, it is my intention to hold a third call of the group broadband scheme and my officials are currently finalising the application procedure and documentation. I expect to be in a position to formally launch the third call shortly. Full details of the GBS scheme are <?oasys _ch ?>available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 122, 156, 169, 171, 177, 190, 210, 217, 219 and 220 together.</P><Col N="140"/>
        <P>I have no function in regulating pricing for services, termination costs or quality of service in the telecommunications market. The regulation of telecommunications operators, including regulating of pricing for phone services, mobile phone termination costs and quality of service is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and regulations which transpose the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. The regulation of financial service costs in this State is a matter for the Irish Financial Services Regulator Authority.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have responsibility for overall telecoms policy. My main goal in this policy is to create conditions for sustainable growth and competition that will benefit the economic and social development of Ireland and facilitate competitive services.</P>
        <P>Improving the market conditions to enhance competition is the best way to drive down mobile phone charges to the end user. The more competitive telecoms services that are on offer, the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy. In March 2004 my predecessor issued policy directions to ComReg, including a direction on competition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The direction on competition mandates ComReg to focus on competition as a key objective, with a particular focus on competition in the fixed and mobile markets and to implement, where necessary, remedies which counteract or remove barriers to entry and support entry by new players to the market and entry into new sectors by existing players and to have particular regard to the following also: market share of new entrants; ensuring that the applicable margin attributable to a product at the wholesale level is sufficient to promote and sustain competition; price level to the end user; and the potential of alternative technology delivery platforms to support competition.</P>
        <P>ComReg has, as one of its key objectives, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the promotion of competition in the exercise of its functions. Competition in the fixed and mobile markets will drive down prices for consumers. I have no information to say that Irish mobile charges are generally the highest in Europe. However, ComReg&rsquo;s quarterly key data for the Irish communications market for quarter four 2005 indicates that the average revenue per user, ARPU, for Ireland is &euro;47 per month, second only to Switzerland at &euro;48 per month. The EU ARPU is &euro;30 per month.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 608 together.</P>
        <P>Biomass energy offers undoubted potential in the context of strategies to develop indigenous energy supplies from renewable resources, thereby contributing to security of supply, lower emissions and alternative sources of income for the agriculture, forestry and waste management sectors. It also has the potential to provide a source of low-cost energy across all sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives are under way to integrate biomass into heating and electricity infrastructures. In 2005 Sustainable Energy Ireland launched a pilot Bioheat programme which provides grant aid towards the cost of wood chip and pellet boilers in the commercial, services and industrial sectors.</P>
        <P>As announced in the recent budget, I am putting in place a &euro;65 million multi-annual package to support renewable energy initiatives. These innovative measures include funding support for biomass commercial heaters following on the success of the 2005 bioheat programme, as well as a new programme to grant aid domestic renewable technologies, including biomass. My Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland are finalising a suite of measures with a view to launching these programmes as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The biomass sector has attracted the largest level of support under Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme. A number of headline projects have been supported under the measure, which are stimulating interest in solar and wood heating systems around the country.</P>
        <P>To date we have achieved just over 20MW of installed generating capacity from renewable biomass technologies operational on the electricity network. This is a good start but we need to steadily increase the contribution from renewable energy sources, including biomass, to total electricity production. I have announced a new support programme that will move from competitive tendering under the alternative energy requirement, AER, programme to a fixed price based system to be known as the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT.</P><Col N="142"/>
        <P>The REFIT programme has been the subject of public consultation and the views received have usefully informed the final shape of the programme. I intend to launch the REFIT programme at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>The initiatives taken to date reflect some of the key recommendations of the bioenergy strategy group that was established in late 2003 to develop strategies to stimulate increased use of biomass for energy conversion. Membership of the group comprised representatives of key Departments as well as State agencies in the agriculture and energy sectors and industry representatives. The report of the bioenergy strategy group will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>Following a public consultation process on the future development of renewable energy, the renewable energy development group, REDG, was established in May 2004 in order to oversee strategies for the future development of our renewable resources, including biomass resources. The group is chaired by my Department and brings together key players including the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, ESB national grid and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>if he will report on the impact of the ban on deep water gill nets that was introduced by the recent EU Fisheries Council in December 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The ban on the use of deep water gill nets is set down in the 2006 TAC and quota regulation. Under this regulation, EU fishing vessels may no longer deploy gill nets, entangling nets or trammel nets at a depth of greater than 200 m in certain areas, including waters to the north, west and south west of Ireland. The regulation also requires the removal of such nets from the specified areas by 1 February 2006.</P>
        <P>The introduction of this ban stems from a report, known as the Deepnet report, published in 2005 following extensive work by representatives of eight fisheries agencies, including Ireland&rsquo;s Bord Iascaigh Mhara supported by the Marine Institute. The report conservatively estimated that between 5,800 and 8,700 km. of these types of nets had been lost and abandoned and were, therefore, in effect, constantly fishing in a large area to the west of Ireland and causing considerable damage to fish stocks, especially deep water shark and monkfish.</P>
        <P>Following publication of this important report, the findings of which alarmed me, I immediately <Col N="143"/>called on the Commission to bring forward measures to deal with this problem and I am delighted that such a decisive step was taken at the recent December Council. While I understand that the current ban is regarded by the EU Commission as a short term emergency measure and that the Commission will bring forward long-term measures during the course of 2006, I will be at the forefront in pushing for the continuation of the current ban unless strong, effective alternative measures are brought forward by the Commission. The authors of the Deepnet report can be proud of their work and I congratulate them for presenting such an impressive and graphic portrayal of the situation.</P>

        <P>The regulation of telecommunications operators, including pricing for mobile services, is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002 and regulations made under the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.</P>
        <P>All our EU partners are also subject to the same EU regulatory framework. In this situation telecommunications markets are regulated on a national basis by independent regulators. Ofcom is responsible for the regulation of telecommunications operators in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Any changes to the existing EU regulatory framework would be subject to negotiations at EU level. The EU regulatory framework is currently being reviewed at EU level. I have already raised and will continue to raise the issue of roaming with my EU counterparts.</P>
        <P>In addition to this I should also point out that there is close co-operation between both regulators and governments. I welcome the announcement in December of ComReg and Ofcom adopting a coordinated approach to licensing certain designated frequency spectrum on an all-island basis. This is a real example of cooperation in action.</P>
        <P>I have prioritised roaming charges as an issue that is of concern to people on the island. Minister Angela Smith, my Northern counterpart, and I have had a number of meetings with the regulators who are working with the operators North and South, and looking at ways to address the issue of inadvertent roaming. These discussions have focused on improving network coverage and exploring tariff options. I realise that this is an issue that involves business decisions, which is a matter for the operators.</P>
        <P>For my part, I have already taken the opportunity in meeting the operators, to raise this issue and will continue to do so. I will also continue to pursue the issue with the Northern Ireland Minister Angela Smith.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 128 together.</P>
        <P>Security of supply in relation to energy is a key policy objective. The relatively small size of our national electricity and gas markets underlines the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply, promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity and gas markets into the wider European market.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to progressing the development of east-west electricity interconnection as a matter of priority. In line with the Government&rsquo;s priority wish, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, at my Department&rsquo;s request has been engaged in a process of rigorous exploration of the options for such development and I expect to receive the Commission&rsquo;s advice shortly.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, both Governments jointly endorsed plans put forward by the CER and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation for the construction of a second North-South electricity interconnector. Planning for the construction of the interconnector is under way by the transmission system operators and it is estimated that the interconnector will be operational by 2012.</P>
        <P>The additional east-west and North-South interconnectors will provide enhanced system security and reliability and will provide competition. The North-South interconnector development will also critically underpin the all-island single electricity market.</P>
        <P>In terms of gas supply, our established good interconnection with the UK, which encompasses two gas interconnectors ensures that Ireland has sufficient importation capacity from external sources. A North-South gas pipeline is also under construction and is scheduled for commissioning in October 2006. The pipeline will extend from Gormanston County Meath to Belfast.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to welcome the recent developments at An Post where the parties have accepted the Labour Court recommendations of 22 November last <Col N="146"/>which has led to a resolution to the recent industrial relations difficulties at An Post.</P>
        <P>On foot of this Labour Court recommendation, the company has paid the outstanding increases due last year under Sustaining Progress and has agreed to pay all future increases as they fall due and the unions have signed up to a change and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>These are very welcome developments and I look forward to the parties working together to implement the change programme that is so essential to the company&rsquo;s financial viability and to providing the quality of service which customers are entitled to expect.</P>
        <P>As regards the liberalisation of the postal sector, it is provided for in European Directives 97/67/EC and 2002/39/EC, which set out the requirements for member states on the provision of high quality postal services and liberalisation within their postal networks. Under the directives, each member state is obliged to provide a universal service whereby a minimum level of service must be provided including a delivery no less than five days a week. Both of these directives have been transposed into Irish law in SI 616 of 2002 European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Liberalisation in Ireland has already commenced and since the transposition of the directives, the weight limit applying to postal items falling within the reserved area and therefore not open to competition has been reduced to 100g from 2003 with a price limit of three times the basic tariff for domestic and inbound international mail. The reserved area was further reduced to mail weighing 50 g or less and two and a half times the basic tariff from 1 January this year for domestic and inbound international mail. Outbound international mail was fully liberalised on 1 January 2004. The second directive also proposes that the postal sector is to liberalise across the EU in full on 1 January 2009 subject to political agreement.</P>
        <P>I understand the next steps for the Commission include a prospective study to be completed on the impact on the universal service of the full accomplishment of a liberalised postal market. Based on the outcome of this study which is currently under way, the Commission will present a report to the European Parliament and Council by 31 December 2006 accompanied by a proposal confirming, if appropriate, the date of 2009 for the full liberalisation of the postal market or to determine alternative steps in light of the study&rsquo;s conclusions.</P>
        <P>I have no plans, at this stage, to bring forward the date of further liberalisation of the remaining postal services that are currently exempt from competition but I will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 140 together.</P>
        <P>Security of energy supply is a key policy objective. The relatively small size of our national electricity and gas markets underlines the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply, promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity and gas markets into the wider European market.</P>
        <P>As I have previously advised the House, the Government is fully committed to progress the development of east-west electricity interconnection as a matter of priority. In line with Government&rsquo;s priority wish, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, at my Department&rsquo;s request has been engaged in a process of rigorous exploration of the options for such development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The CER engaged a consortium of external professional advice on the financial, technical, commercial and procurement aspects of the development. A consultation process was undertaken by the consortium with parties who expressed an interest in the past to the commission relating to the project or had a potentially relevant perspective to share in relation to it. The report of the consultants, which is now complete, includes a comprehensive technical and legal review and an analysis of the regulatory and procurement dimensions. I recently met the commissioners for a briefing on the report at which I again underlined the priority need to move ahead with the development.</P>
        <P>The next step in the process is to decide on the best mechanism to take the east-west electricity interconnection project forward, be it on a regulated or a hybrid regulated-merchant basis. The decision will be informed by the advice of the commission in the matter, as soon as it completes its detailed consideration of the findings of the report.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The television without frontiers directive provides that member states of the European Communities may designate certain sporting and cultural events as being of major importance to society and that events so designated should continue to be available on a free television service.</P>
        <P>In March 2003 the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 (Designation of Major Events) Order 2003 specified the events designated as events of major importance to society for which the right of a qualifying broadcaster to provide coverage on free television services should be provided in the public interest.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Act 2003, requires me to carry out a review of designated events not later than three years after the passing of the 2003 Act, that is to say, not later than April 2006. I announced my intention to commence this review in December 2005. The purpose of the review is to consider if the list of events designated in 2003 should be amended.</P>
        <P>As part of the review I have initiated a public consultation process. My Department has written to the sporting organisations that organise the events already designated along with the European Tour and Ryder Cup informing them of the review and seeking their views. My Department has also sought the views of broadcasters. The closing date for submissions is 27 January.</P>
        <P>If, following the review, I should decide to amend the list of designated events, then, in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, I will publish my intention to do so and seek the views of interested parties. This would involve a further formal consultation with event organisers and broadcasters. EU approval would also be required before I could lay an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas to give effect to the designation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>A recent review of staffing requirements at Killybegs fishery harbour centre has not indicated any additional requirement in relation to general operative positions. There have been no appointments due to the current situation in relation to fish stocks and related activity in the fishing industry. This situation coupled with an increase in the number of vessels landing to other ports last year, has resulted in a reduction in local activity. However, I am pleased to confirm that most of the pelagic fleet are landing into Killybegs since the beginning of the year, thus creating greater activity and employment. Additionally, the new harbour development at Killybegs has greatly increased general and operational efficiency, which has resulted in a reduced staffing requirement. I am also pleased to confirm that my plans for the establishment of a Border inspection post is well advanced.</P>
        <P>The &euro;50 million investment at Killybegs fishery harbour centre had provided enhanced facilities and services for our fishing fleet, and will stimulate the local economy, protect existing employment in the region and generate new opportunities. It was not intended that the development would be focused on employment creation only in the operation of the fishery harbour centre, although there was an obvious employment benefit to the local community during the extended construction phase.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The primary objective in relation to the development is to meet the present and future demands of the fishing industry. It is also intended that the development will also allow the port to take account of future potential business opportunities in the region. Some of these opportunities are already being exploited, for example business from the offshore oil and gas industry and cruise vessels, and I am confident from discussions with local businesses and entrepreneurs that further opportunities are being created and these will in time create improved employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>Currently my officials are conducting a public tender process offering sites within the Fishery harbour centre for business proposals in the fishing and fishing-processing sector. I am confident this process will result in a flagship development with obvious employment potential. That type of development would not have been possible without the new harbour facilities provided at Killybegs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have no doubt the fishery harbour development has not alone safeguarded some existing jobs in the region but has already generated some additional employment there. I anticipate that this gradual up-scaling will continue and that further progress will be achieved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 174 together.</P>
        <P>The digital hub project, managed by the independent Digital Hub Development Agency, has been and will continue to be successful in developing a digital industry cluster, as well as in regenerating an historic community area in the heart of Dublin by operating a number of significant community and educational initiatives as part of its role in the digital hub district.</P>
        <P>Expenditure at the digital hub since 2000 is approximately &euro;126.3 million. This includes a &euro;76 million investment in property and infrastructure as well as &euro;50.3 million in operational costs. During 2005, &euro;2.5 million was provided to the Digital Hub Development Agency to clear an overdraft, which had been built up through its operating <Col N="151"/>costs during 2004 and part-2005. In addition, &euro;850,000 was provided during 2005 to meet the ongoing operating costs of the agency. Future costs will be kept under review by the Department and will be subject to negotiations with the agency.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>On 5 October, the agency announced a competition to develop land in the digital hub. This land is to be developed as a mixture of residential, commercial and retail properties, in addition to public spaces. The private developers competed on the basis of bids of cash plus office space.</P>
        <P>On 22 November, I announced the acceptance of tenders for two sites, with a combined area of almost 5.6 acres for approximately &euro;118 million. In return for the land, the State will receive a combination of &euro;72.4 million in cash and &euro;45.7 million in high quality offices, which will accommodate digital enterprises as the digital hub grows. The break down of the tenders means that the digital hub will receive over 13,000 sq. m., 140,000 sq.ft., of office space.</P>
        <P>In relation to industry development, the agency has been successful to date in growing the cluster with about 50 companies now employing approximately 500 employees in the hub. These enterprises are involved in a range of activities including games software development, mobile technology, animation and TV production.</P>
        <P>The digital hub has engaged with local community interests on the project from the very beginning. The consultation takes place through the unique community, public, private partnership &mdash; CPPP &mdash; process, which is chaired by DHDA board member, Peter Cassells. As a result of the consultation, the two private developers are required under the terms of the development contract to engage with the local community through the CPPP process.</P>
        <P>The successful tenderers will now be required to make a planning application within six months and on receipt of planning to construct the office space offered. They must engage with interested parties through the CPPP process. The office space will facilitate the future expansion of the digital hub by accommodating digital media enterprises. The amount that will be used for residential or other commercial purposes will be a matter for the tenderers and the planning authorities.</P>

	<P>I have had no meetings with the management or unions of An Post so far this year. However, during the <Col N="152"/>recent industrial relations difficulties at the company, I held a number of meetings with representatives of An Post management, the chairperson and representatives of the company&rsquo;s unions on a number of occasions at which I emphasised to all parties the importance of an early start to the company&rsquo;s modernisation and that both sides engage directly, and work in partnership in order to resolve the problems besetting the company.</P>
        <P>The recent developments at An Post, where the parties have accepted the Labour Court recommendations of 22 November last leading to a resolution to the recent industrial relations difficulties at An Post are therefore most welcome.</P>
        <P>On foot of this Labour Court recommendation, the company has paid the outstanding increases due last year under Sustaining Progress to all employees and pensioners and has agreed to pay all future increases as they fall due and the unions have signed up to a change and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>The company has also accepted the court recommendation that all retrospective payments, relating to the 5% Sustaining Progress increase paid by An Post from 1 January last year, be made to its employees and pensioners as soon as the company is returned to reasonable and sustainable profit and when commercial circumstances permit.</P>
        <P>I now look forward to the parties working together to implement the change programme that is so essential to the company&rsquo;s future financial viability and to providing the quality of service which customers are entitled to expect.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 137, 157 and 215 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services and the development and roll-out of telecommunications technology is primarily a matter for the industry itself. The telecoms market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions.</P>
        <P>As Minister with responsibility for policy in this sector, I welcome all new technology developments and progress. I welcome the introduction of more innovation and competition in the sector, the entry of new players and new product offerings from existing and new suppliers, which mean greater choice and lower prices for consumers.</P>
        <P>In 2004 there were more than 80 Internet service providers while today there are over 156 companies listed by ComReg, with at least 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.</P>
        <P>In essence, there are broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to virtually any broadband customer in Ireland right now. The rate of uptake is dependent on access by the service providers to suitable infrastructure. The latest quarterly data report from ComReg on broadband delivery rates indicates that broadband subscriptions have grown by 19% as of September 2005 and stand at 208,000. DSL remains the largest platform for broadband access, representing 78% of subscriptions and a growth rate of 16% in the last quarter. The proportion of broadband subscriptions delivered over access platforms other than DSL has increased in the last 12 months. The estimated end December 2005 figure for broadband subscribers is 250,000 according to the regulator. The proportion of broadband subscriptions delivered over access platforms other than DSL has increased in the last 12 months.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and <Col N="154"/>cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget.</P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start early in 2006. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These metropolitan area networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the first half of 2006. The construction-installation phase is now under way and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>
        <P>We are the lowest cost country in the OECD for international connectivity; our regional broadband pricing is now on a par with the best in Europe, and the price of basic broadband access is at the EU average. Furthermore, Ireland is now one of the cheapest locations in the world for international leased lines. Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>The most significant aspect of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal is directed at updating the definition of the services that would be covered by the directive to ensure that all audio-visual services that are of the same nature as &ldquo;traditional television broadcasting&rdquo; should be subject to the same rules.</P><Col N="155"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a revised directive also includes proposals for significant amendments to the rules relating to the insertion of advertising. The net effect of this would be to allow broadcasters the same amount of advertising minutage as at present but to allow for considerably more flexibility as to when advertising breaks would be inserted and the frequency of such breaks. The Commission also proposes that the practice of product placement would be allowed, subject to regulation. In developing my position on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal I will shortly initiate a public consultation seeking views from interested parties.</P>

        <Quest>the steps he intends to take at Council of Ministers and European Commission level to effect radical reform of the European Common Fisheries Policy to ensure that Irish naval vessels have real time and accurate information on the updated quota allocation that is available to each individual vessel fishing in Irish waters.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2182/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, was comprehensively reviewed in 2002. One of its key outcomes was a greater emphasis on fisheries control. The reformed CFP contains a specific chapter dealing with control and sets a variety of requirements that all member states must implement to ensure that fisheries resources are adequately protected. I understand the potential benefits underpinning the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion, however, there would be considerable difficulties with its implementation. It would basically require that all member states should have domestic quota management systems. This level of allocation is not the practice in every member state, and such harmonisation is unlikely in the foreseeable future for very complex reasons, including quota ownership.</P>
        <P>Quota management systems are therefore likely to remain a matter of policy choice for each member state. However, there are a number of systems already in place that facilitate control of fishing vessels of other member states.</P>
        <P>For example, each member state must report to the Commission the level of uptake of their national total allowable catch, TAC, for each fish species. If the TAC of any species is exhausted, the control services of every member state are immediately alerted by the Commission that a fishing stop is in place for that species.</P><Col N="156"/>
        <P>Ireland also receives notification directly from individual member states of lists of fishing vessels that have access entitlement under Community legislation on western waters. Ireland&rsquo;s control services also routinely receive information listing the entitlements of listed fishing vessels to participate in specific fisheries. It also advises the flag member state of the logged catches of vessels boarded. It is, accordingly, a matter for the flag member state to take actions, including possible prosecutions, against any vessel that exceeded any internal catch limits established by its administration.</P>
        <P>This co-operation can usefully be strengthened and the impending establishment of the Community Fisheries Control Agency will deliver closer co-operation and thereby make a valuable contribution in the fight against illegal fishing activities.</P>

	<P>I am considering the appointment of a new chairperson of the RTE Authority and will bring a proposal to Government in this regard in due course. Some weeks ago I discussed with Mr. Drury the review that is currently under way of the events that are designated as events of major importance to society and that should be available to the public on a free television service. At the time Mr. Drury indicated that he was confident that no conflict would arise. In his letter of resignation Mr. Drury stated that he no longer believed that to be the case as there is now political debate on the matter. It was with regret that I accepted Mr. Drury&rsquo;s resignation as chairman of the RTE Authority. I place on public record my appreciation for his work as chairman of the authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 228 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EC biofuels directive sets indicative targets to member states of 2% market penetration for biofuels by end 2005. The targets in the directive are indicative and not mandatory. Noting that we are starting from a very low current production base, our objective is to meet the 2% target by 2008 through targeted fiscal measures designed to stimulate market development.</P>
        <P>The Government introduced a scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels under the Finance Act 2004, which was launched in April 2005. Eight projects have been awarded excise relief under the scheme including four pure plant oil, three biodiesel or other biofuel and one bioethanol proposal. It is estimated that the pilot scheme will result in 16 million litres of biofuels being placed on the Irish transport market by next year.</P>
        <P>Building on the success of the pilot biofuels scheme, I have agreed with the Minister for Finance a further targeted package of excise relief valued at &euro;205 million, which was announced in the budget. The new excise relief programme, which is subject to state aid approval, will be rolled out from this year to 2010 and will enable us to reach the initial target of 2% market penetration by biofuels by 2008. When fully operational the relief is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year. I am also providing funding towards the capital cost of developing biofuels processing facilities, which will critically underpin the excise relief package.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing to put in place a clear policy framework for the development of the biofuels market taking into account the various perspectives of all relevant sectors including transport and agriculture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the interdepartmental biofuels group, Liquid Biofuels Strategy Study for Ireland, which advocated excise relief as the most effective short-term measure to stimulate the market was published in December 2004. A detailed report on further implementation of policy options for development of a biofuels market has been overseen by the group and will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>Procurement for the digital terrestrial television, DTT, <Col N="158"/>pilot is well under way, with key tenders at the final evaluation stage. There are a number of stages to the pilot. The procurement processes that are under way relate to the multiplex and transmission aspects of the pilot, essentially the construction of the necessary digital terrestrial television infrastructure. I expect that agreements will be in place on foot of these procurement processes in the coming months and that the infrastructure will be rolled out in the first half of 2006. The initial transmission sites are at Clermont Carn in the north east and Three Rock covering parts of the Dublin region. Once the pilot infrastructure is in place, broadcasts of various programme and data services can commence. It is expected that the pilot will continue for up to two years.</P>
        <P>The pilot will contribute to generating greater awareness and engagement among the various stakeholders in relation to the development of plans for a national rollout of DTT. During the course of the pilot I will continue to consult with interested stakeholders and I look to the Irish broadcasting sector to play an active role in the development of proposals for a national rollout of DTT.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 151, 196, 199, 222 and 227 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the House is aware, I commissioned an international consulting company, Advantica,  on 25 August 2005, to carry out a thorough and independent safety review of the onshore, upstream section of the Corrib gas pipeline. Advantica is a world leader in the area of advanced hazard and risk assessment technologies for gas pipelines.</P>
        <P>The consultants were asked to conclude whether the proposed installations will comply with recognised international best practice and will deliver a facility that is fit for purpose. In parallel with this safety review, I established a public consultation process to ensure that the concerns of the community would be fully addressed in this review. As part of this process, a two-day public hearing was held in Geesala on 12 and 13 October, chaired by Mr. John Gallagher SC, during which the community was given the opportunity to express its concerns directly to the consultants. The consultants also made a separate site inspection of the pipeline route. I also nominated a mediator, Mr. Peter <Col N="160"/>Cassells, to work with the community and the developer.</P>
        <P>A draft of the safety review was published and presented to the community on 8 December and the consultants and members of my technical advisory group were present to hear initial comments on this draft. The review explicitly took into account the concerns expressed to the consultants at the public hearing and addressed each of these thoroughly. The selection process for the overall project design was also evaluated, as were the methodologies used to decide on an optimum route for the pipeline. Written submissions were invited on this draft, with a closing date of 22 December.</P>
        <P>The consultants were forwarded copies of these submissions, and these were used in preparing the final report. I have only just received Advantica&rsquo;s final report and will consider it and the implications it has for the project as a whole when I receive the report from my technical advisory group. I will make the necessary decisions taking these reports and recommendations fully into account.</P>
        <P>As long as the mediator, Mr. Cassells, is engaged in the delicate and important work of mediation &mdash; not arbitration &mdash; I do not intend to discuss the details of this work. Clearly the mediation process cannot carry on indefinitely and I hope Mr. Cassells can bring it to a conclusion in a reasonable timeframe.</P>
        <P>The role of the mediator is wider than just the gas project and I understand he is looking at the availability of services generally throughout the region, including in particular, the role of gas supply in the area, in the context of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s proposals to modify some of the connection terms. I would encourage people to look at the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s consultation on this matter.</P>

	<P>The Government is addressing the local infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget.</P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start early in 2006. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These metropolitan area networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>Further to a competitive, public tender process, E-Net was awarded the contract to manage, maintain, market and operate the MANs for a period of 15 years in June 2004. E-Net is an independent company based in Limerick established solely for this purpose.</P><Col N="162"/>
        <P>Under phase 1 of the MANs programme, 23 networks have now been completed and handed over to E-Net. A further four MANs are nearing completion and due for hand-over to E-Net in quarter one of 2006. Activity has now begun on the networks with several customer contracts being signed by E-Net, including arrangements for backhaul and 20 of the 23 MANs have been lit to date. The details of these contracts are commercially sensitive and are a matter for E-Net.</P>
        <P>E-Net&rsquo;s contractual obligations for the management, operation and maintenance of the MANs are set out in the concession agreement between my Department and E-Net. Tight controls exist within the concession agreement to closely monitor E-Net&rsquo;s performance. E-Net formally reports to my Department on a quarterly basis and is obliged to file various documents throughout the contract term dealing with its activities. E-Net also publishes an annual set of accounts. My officials closely monitor E-Net to ensure that it is fulfilling its obligations, in line with the concession agreement.</P>

        <Quest>the number of post offices or sub-post offices that have been closed down or downgraded in the past 12 months; his proposals to ensure the continuation of the fullest possible extent of the postal services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to the following appendix that outlines the information requested on the number of post offices converted or closed in the past 12 months. With regard to the post office network, as clearly set out in the programme for Government, this Government and the board of An Post is committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is a clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these benefits.</P>
        <P>The An Post network comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country. In the European context, Ireland still has the highest number of post offices per head of population. In recent years some network restructuring has been undertaken. This activity is in line with similar trends across Europe. In addition to the post office network, An Post has also established 2,864 <Col N="163"/>Postpoint outlets in retail premises of which 600 can be used for bill payment.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s objective to maintain the largest, economically sustainable post office network possible. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size.</P>
        <P>While the Government will support the network in any way it can and has demonstrated its commitment in a tangible fashion, with a &euro;12.7 million capital injection in 2003, the way forward is for An Post to enhance existing services and building on existing strengths, to develop new product offerings.</P>
        <P>The network has a high footfall and to capitalise on these advantages it is essential that existing and new services are developed to meet customer requirements. The network also has the capacity and potential to deliver more private business especially in financial services and opportunities are actively being pursued by An Post in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On foot of substantial investment in computerisation, a significant amount of extra business has already been obtained for the network in terms of banking and utility business. At present 95% of An Post&rsquo;s business is conducted through automated offices. I have also asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network and in this light, An Post is currently working on a new initiative which could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.</P>

        <QRef>[2109/06]</QRef><Col N="165"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Energy conservation and energy efficiency strategies have a critical contribution to make to competitiveness, security of supply and environmental sustainability. The objective is to enable continued growth in economic output using less energy input. The impact of energy efficiency and conservation measures on future energy consumption, total final energy consumption, or future total primary energy requirements, TPER, is difficult to predict. However, recent trends confirm that Ireland&rsquo;s energy intensity, an indicator commonly used for energy efficiency, has fallen over the period 1990 to 2004.</P>
        <P>Primary energy intensity fell by 32% between 1990 and 2004, or 2.9% per annum. According to Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy statistical support unit, 2004 confirmed a continued trend in the decoupling of economic growth from energy usage and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions levels. The economy grew by 4.4% while energy use only grew by 1.4% and energy related CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions by 1.1%. These welcome reductions in energy and carbon intensity are a result of improvements in generation efficiency, choice of fuels, achievement of economies of scale and the changes in the structure of the country&rsquo;s economy.</P>
        <P>I recently launched a public consultation on the European Commission&rsquo;s Green Paper on Energy Efficiency or Doing More with Less. The Green Paper underlines the importance of energy and energy efficiency and highlights the fact that all sectors of the economy and society as a whole have a part to play in reducing energy demand, saving money and reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions. There are three main ways to reduce national energy demand: eliminating waste, cutting back on demand and using fuels more efficiently. Every stage of every process whether industrial, commercial or domestic will yield efficiencies when examined and all these savings will aggregate to form a substantial total. In tandem with maintaining economic growth, greater energy efficiency will enable reductions in energy demand resulting in savings on fuel import bills, contributing to meeting our Kyoto commitment on greenhouse gases and savings to the economy and consumers.</P>
        <P>As announced in the recent budget, I am putting in place a multi-annual financial package to support renewable energy across the electricity, heat and transport sectors. The package of measures includes a five-year biofuels excise relief scheme costing in excess of &euro;200 million and funding of &euro;65 million for renewable energy schemes, including provision for a grant aid programme for small scale CHP units. The package will contribute to the large-scale deployment of renewable sources of energy over the next five years. I intend to launch these schemes, currently <Col N="166"/>being finalised by my Department in conjunction with SEI, as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Successive rounds of the alternative energy requirements programme, AER, have targeted the penetration of renewable technologies in electricity generation. I will shortly announce details of the new support programme designed to further increase the contribution to total electricity production from renewable energy sources. The programme will operate on a fixed price based system to be known as the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT.</P>
        <P>I approved in 2004 a &euro;364 million capital investment by ESB in its 915 MW coal-fired generating station at Moneypoint, County Clare, which will enable the station to meet its environmental obligations under the EU&rsquo;s national emissions ceiling directive, NEC, and the large combustion plant directive, LCPD. The investment will reduce significantly the existing levels of sulphur dioxide, SO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>, and nitrous oxide, NOx, emissions in line with the obligations under the directives.</P>
        <P>Natural gas, which represents 47% of feedstock to electricity generation and 25% of national total primary energy requirements, produces no sulphur dioxide and no ash and thus has a reduced environmental impact.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland is responsible for the sustainable energy priority programme under the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, which supports a range of research, design construction and other initiatives in renewable technologies and energy efficiency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Funding is currently available to support feasibility studies into the use of combined heat and power and district heating systems. Under scenarios developed up to 2010, 11%, 4,104 GWh, of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity could be generated from CHP, assuming the high electricity demand forecast in the ESB national grid generation adequacy report for 2004-2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154, 155, 167 and 176 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The principal reason for the slow roll-out of broadband services generally has been the slower rate of investment by the private sector in the necessary infrastructure to deliver broadband to all areas. The Government is addressing the local infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget.</P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start early in 2006. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These metropolitan area networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area, with each application being assessed by the Department&rsquo;s technical advisers. To date, more than 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P><Col N="168"/>
        <P>A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school with broadband by the beginning of 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources&rsquo; wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. The construction-installation phase is now under way, and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ranking of Ireland against other European countries reflects the late launch of competitive, affordable broadband by private broadband service providers in Ireland and a slow take-up by consumers.</P>
        <P>However, Ireland&rsquo;s rating is improving. According to recent EU Internet statistics there are more than 2 million Internet users in Ireland. This represents user growth of 163% in the past four years and a market penetration per population of 51.2%, which compares favourably with the EU average of 48.9%. Irish broadband prices are now below the EU average and this should have the effect of further stimulating demand.</P>
        <P>In late 2004 the Government set a target of 400,000 broadband subscribers to be achieved by the end of 2006. I have challenged the industry to strive for 500,000 subscribers by that stage. The Government&rsquo;s broadband target is to be within the top half of EU countries by the end of 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158, 202 and 208 together.</P>
        <P>There will continue to be a key national role for An Post both in delivery of mails and as a quality service provider through its nationwide network of post office outlets. The development of the post office network and the delivery of services through that network is the responsibility, in the first instance, of the board and management of the company.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Government, as clearly set out in the programme for Government, and the board of An Post, is committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is a clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these social benefits.</P>
        <P>The An Post network comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country. In the European context, Ireland still has the highest number of post offices per head of population. In recent years some network restructuring has been undertaken. This activity is in line with similar trends across Europe. In addition to the post office network, An Post has established 2,864 Postpoint outlets in retail premises of which 600 can be used for bill payment.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s objective to maintain the largest, economic ally sustainable post office network possible. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size.</P>
        <P>While the Government will support the network in any way it can and has demonstrated its commitment in a tangible fashion, with a &euro;12.7 million capital injection in 2003, the way forward is for An Post to enhance its existing services and, building on existing strengths, to develop new product offerings.</P>
        <P>The network has a high footfall and to capitalise on these advantages, it is essential that existing and new services are developed to meet customer requirements. The network also has the capacity and potential to deliver more private business especially in financial services and opportunities are actively being pursued by An Post in this area.</P><Col N="170"/>
        <P>On foot of substantial investment in computerisation, a significant amount of extra business has already been obtained for the network in terms of banking and utility business. At present 95% of An Post&rsquo;s business is conducted through automated offices.</P>
        <P>I have also asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network. In this light, An Post is currently working on an initiative which would see the development of An Post Financial Services, APFS. Its aim is to supply a wide range of retail financial services through the branch network. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>the measures he intends taking in response to the fact that a company (details supplied) views that, for the Irish Sea and the west of Scotland, its data on fish stocks is very bad and that Ireland&rsquo;s marine scientists are openly questioning the scientific basis of EU total allowable catches, in view of the perceived widespread under-reporting and misreporting of landings.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2187/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The continuing need for conservation of fish stocks demonstrates the importance of having timely and accurate scientific advice available to allow for decision making. The scientific community has, for many years, expressed a general concern on both the quality and availability of fisheries data to assist it in its task of assessing fish stocks. This is a source of concern to me as it is to my colleagues on the Fisheries Council.</P>
        <P>Detailed rules and regulations are in place governing the recording of catches of fish stocks and for landings by EU fishing vessels. Misreporting and under-reporting of catches is considered a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, and there are significant penalties in place for such contraventions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I stress the great importance which Ireland attaches to compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, including reporting obligations on fishermen. As part of the drive to increase the effectiveness of fisheries surveillance, major enhancements to national fisheries control and enforcement capabilities have been implemented in recent years, and currently there is a recruitment process under way for additional sea fisheries protection officers. In addition, I announced recently during the Second Stage debate on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill my intention to establish an indepen<Col N="171"/>dent body charged with the enforcement of national, EU and international sea fisheries law.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department regularly reviews all aspects of the broadband market and holds discussions with broadband interest groups, both public and private, to listen to their concerns. These discussions are ongoing and typically cover a range of issues relevant to broadband supply and demand nationally including the operation of the metropolitan area networks, MANs.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the local infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access MANs in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget.</P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start early in 2006. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These metropolitan area networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>In June 2004, the contract for management of the Government and local authority regional metropolitan broadband networks was awarded to E-Net, a company based in Limerick. The term of the contract is 15 years. E-Net operates as a wholesaler of access to the MANs and offers a full suite of products including ducting, sub-ducting, dark fibre, high level managed capacity, co-location facilities and relevant auxiliary services. Under phase one, 23 networks have now been completed and handed over to E-Net. Activity has now begun on the networks with several cus<Col N="172"/>tomer contracts being signed by E-Net, including arrangements for backhaul and 18 of the 23 MANs have been lit to date.</P>
        <P>My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area, with each application being assessed by the Department&rsquo;s technical advisers. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P>
        <P>A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the beginning of 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning, and my Department&rsquo;s wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. The construction-installation phase is now under way, and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>
        <P>The Government believes broadband connectivity forms a significant part of ICT development. High-speed, resilient, low cost broadband is an essential feedstock for that sector. It has, and will continue to play, a vital role in moving Ireland to the forefront of knowledge-based economies in the world.</P>
        <P>The ranking of Ireland against other European countries reflects the late launch of competitive, affordable broadband by private broadband service providers in Ireland and a slow take-up by consumers. However, Ireland&rsquo;s rating is improving. According to recent EU Internet statistics there are more than 2 million Internet users in Ireland. This represents user growth of 163% in the past four years and a market penetration per population of 51.2%, which compares <?oasys _dc28- ?>favourably with the EU average of 48.9%.<?oasys _dc0- ?> Irish broadband prices are now below the EU average and this should have the effect of further stimulating demand.</P>
        <P>In 2004 there were more than 80 Internet service providers, today there are more than 156 companies listed by ComReg, with at least 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly, and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.</P>
        <P>The latest quarterly data report from ComReg on broadband delivery rates indicates that broadband subscriptions have grown by 19% as of <Col N="173"/>September 2005 and stand at 208,000. DSL remains the largest platform for broadband access, representing 78% of subscriptions and a growth rate of 16% in the last quarter. The proportion of broadband subscriptions delivered over access platforms other than DSL has increased in the past 12 months. The estimated end-December 2005 figure for broadband subscribers is 250,000 according to the regulator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 170 and 187 together.</P>
        <P>Security of supply in electricity is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005. Article 28 provides that it shall be the duty of the Commission to monitor the security of supply of electricity and that the Commission shall take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply.</P>
        <P>ESB National Grid has provided the Commission with a report on the investigation into the electrical system disturbance on 5 August 2005 which led to the temporary loss of supply to 326,000 customers in Ireland and a further 74,000 customers in Northern Ireland. The report notes that the power system was being operated normally prior to the incident and identifies a primary cause, a secondary cause and a third con<Col N="176"/>tributor to the incident. The primary cause is identified as an incorrect detection of separation of the electrical systems North and South and the secondary cause is identified as an incorrect operation of the Moyle interconnector run-back scheme. These causes resulted in an import from Scotland of 115 MW turning into an export of 416 MW causing a deficit on the island of 531 MW. The report also identifies a third contributor as the subsequent performance of three large ESB-owned generating units at Moneypoint and Tarbert, two of which lost output completely in response to the initial disturbance.</P>
        <P>The report notes that the underfrequency load-shedding scheme operated correctly in response to the disturbance and prevented power system collapse. The report concludes that the causes of the disturbance have been identified, that remedies are being or have been implemented and that a recurrence is highly unlikely.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of alerts for the electricity system is a matter for ESB National Grid as the transmission system operator. ESB National Grid states that system alerts are internal industry signals to generators to encourage caution at times when the margin between capacity and demand is tight. They are used to reduce the chances of a failure of a generator which could lead to a shortage overall. ESB National Grid states that there have been no occasions this winter when electricity supplies have been affected by a shortage of capacity. However, it remains the case that the margin between capacity and demand for electricity is tighter than normal this winter.</P>
        <P>The availability performance of some of the existing older ESB generation plant is giving cause for concern and has been for some years. Performance did improve in 2004 and during the first half of 2005. However, it declined again in the second half of last year as a result of the breakdown of several large ESB generation units. The resultant impact has been that at times during the winter the margin between demand and available generation has been and may continue to be lower than the design level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Commission has advised my Department that it is investigating concerns about significant volatility in the price of top-up electricity and the implications of any such volatility for existing independent generators. Pending the outcome of this investigation it would be premature to speculate on the cause and effect of volatile top-up prices for existing or potential players.</P>
        <P>In the performance of its role in relation to security of supply generally, the Commission has secured the provision of two new generating stations, Aughinish Alumina and Tynagh Energy, with a combined capacity of over 500 MW. These new stations are currently being commissioned. Furthermore, the Commission informs my Department that Viridian has commenced the construction of a second generating plant at its <Col N="177"/>Huntstown site which will provide a further 400 MW of capacity by the end of 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 172, 207 and 641 together.</P>
        <P>I intend to publish an energy policy consultation paper in the first half of 2006 which will set out medium and long-term perspectives for national energy policy and which will take account of the considerable and complex challenges for Irish energy policy going forward.</P>
        <P>Following on the informal EU Heads of State meeting last autumn at Hampton Court and in light of a range of developments including security of oil and gas supply concerns, there is distinctly renewed interest in developing a common energy policy at EU level. This is reflected in recent statements by the Commissioner and the Austrian Presidency.</P>
        <P>The energy agenda, including the possible framework for a new policy, security of supply and the operation of the internal energy market will be discussed at the spring European Council. The Government will approach any emerging proposal for a common energy policy with an open mind and I would expect Ireland to play a proactive part in any future process to scope and shape the basic principles, objectives and actions of such a policy consistent with our own national priorities. I will meet Commissioner Piebalgs in the coming weeks, which will be an opportunity to review developments with him.</P>

	<P>Fish habitats and stocks are <Col N="179"/>under threat from a variety of adverse environmental and water quality pressures both at sea and in rivers and estuaries. These pressures, along with over-exploitation of stocks, pose a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of this natural resource.</P>
        <P>Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the protection, conservation and management of inland fisheries stocks rests with the central and regional fisheries boards. As Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, I rely on the advice of the fisheries boards when determining policy and legislative measures aimed at protecting these stocks. Any such measures that may be recommended to me, whether in respect of game or coarse angling, will be considered with a view to their early implementation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The central and regional fisheries boards devote considerable effort and resources, in collaboration with Tourism Ireland, to the promotion of angling tourism. The overall decline in angling tourism is not unique to Ireland but reflects a trend widespread in Europe. The report of the Tourism policy review group to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in September 2003, observes a decline in activity holidays which is not confined to angling but includes cycling and hill-walking also.</P>
        <P>I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is carrying out research among tour operators involved in promoting special activity holidays and special activity holidaymakers. Problems identified include rising costs and access to activities. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also identified angling among main areas of activity for which detailed marketing plans have been agreed, targeting the markets offering the best short-term return. Several other supporting activities are identified across all products including greater understanding of international trends in demand for special interest products.</P>

	<P>According to figures supplied by the energy policy statistical support unit, EPSSU, of Sustainable Energy Ireland, Ireland&rsquo;s total primary energy requirement for 2004 was 15,341 kilotonnes of oil equivalent, ktoe. Some 13,801 ktoe &mdash; 89% &mdash; of this was imported.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>the position in regard to the provision of broadband throughout the country with particular reference to the entire island; if achievements in this jurisdiction are equal to those elsewhere; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The telecommunications sectors in both jurisdictions are fully liberalised but regulated, by ComReg in the Republic and by Ofcom in Northern Ireland. While private sector broadband infrastructure is currently more extensive in Northern Ireland and the percentage of broadband subscribers is higher, the gap continues to narrow. My Department and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment are jointly implementing the &euro;7 million, EU supported, INTERREG IIIa initiative, which is funding a number of projects to improve broadband connectivity in Border areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s relatively low ranking against other European countries in terms of broadband connections reflects the late launch of competitive, affordable broadband by private broadband service providers in Ireland and a slow take-up by consumers.</P>
        <P>However, the situation is improving rapidly. In 2004 there were more than 80 Internet service providers, today there are more than 156 companies listed by ComReg, with at least 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly, and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity and the development of Wi-Max, offers considerable potential in the future.</P>
        <P>In essence, there are broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to virtually any broadband customer in Ireland right now. The rate of uptake is dependent on access by the service providers to suitable infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The latest quarterly data report from ComReg on broadband delivery rates indicates that broadband subscriptions have grown by 19% as of September 2005 and stand at 208,000. DSL remains the largest platform for broadband <Col N="183"/>access, representing 78% of subscriptions and a growth rate of 16% in the last quarter. The proportion of broadband subscriptions delivered over access platforms other than DSL has increased in the last 12 months. The estimated end-December 2005 figure for broadband subscribers is 250,000 according to the regulator.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open access, carrier neutral metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has so far delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country. This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide and these MANs are due for completion during 2006 and 2007. These metropolitan area networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, more than 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P>
        <P>A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school with broadband by the first half of 2006. The construction-installation phase is now under way, and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>
        <P>We are the lowest cost country in the OECD for international connectivity. Our regional broadband pricing is now on a par with the best in Europe, and the price of basic broadband access is at the EU average. Furthermore, Ireland is now one of the cheapest locations in the world for international leased lines. Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>While there remains a surplus of salmon returning to Irish rivers, the Government has accepted the scientific advice that reductions in the overall fishing effort are required to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide. For this reason, current Government policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement up to the level of the scientifically advised conservation limits as soon as possible. In keeping with this policy, when setting the commercial salmon quotas for the 2005 season, I gave a firm commitment to fully align the exploitation of salmon, both at national and district levels, on the scientific advice by 2007.</P>
        <P>I have asked the National Salmon Commission to advise as to how best the alignment of exploitation of salmon with the scientific advice can be implemented by 2007, bearing in mind the requirement to ensure the future biological viability of the salmon resource in all catchments and also the needs of all stakeholders, including those who derive their living from the wild salmon resource.</P>
        <P>A move to single stock management of the wild salmon fishery would take time and significant additional resources. This could not be achieved without further and considerable scientific input, infrastructural investment and planning. The impact of such a move would have to be fully examined and understood before its introduction. I expect the National Salmon Commission along with the relevant State agencies to examine the prospects for single stock management within the Irish fishery and to advise me in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to compensation issues, I welcome the Oireachtas joint committee&rsquo;s acknowledgement that any compensatory schemes should largely be funded by those stakeholders who would be the main economic beneficiaries of more salmon being free to return to the rivers. I also welcome its comment that &ldquo;public monies spent must have, as a primary aim, ensuring the survival of the salmon species and that this precept must be regarded as more important than any economic gain to any sector that may accrue&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Bearing this principle in mind, the Government has consistently ruled out buy-out as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks and has instead, since 2002, promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective.</P>
        <P>Moreover, no convincing case has been advanced as to the public good that would be acquired by the State in the context of a publicly funded buy-out of commercial salmon licences nor why stakeholders benefiting from increased <Col N="185"/>numbers of salmon entering the rivers should not contribute in whole or in part towards achieving that increase.</P>
        <P>As a result, and as I have previously and consistently indicated to the House, I have no plans at present to introduce a buy-out of commercial salmon fishing licences but I am continuing to review the matter in the context of the policy outlined above. In this regard, I would be open to any relevant proposals presented to me whereby stakeholders benefiting from any reduction in commercial catch would engage in the first instance with licence holders and indicate a willingness to address any compensation issues that might arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have referred the broad outline proposals, which were submitted to me, to the National Salmon Commission for an objective evaluation in accordance with its terms of reference in the overall context of conservation management measures designed to achieve the alignment of national and district total allowable catches and quotas. I await its advice in this regard. I will examine carefully all recommendations, including those relevant to single stock management, made by the salmon commission.</P>

	<P>EirGrid has been established as the transmission system operator, TSO, for the electricity network under <Col N="186"/>part 11 of SI 445 of 2000, pursuant to the second EU internal market directive on electricity which requires the vertical unbundling of utilities. The timeframe for completion of the separation of EirGrid is predicated on having in place: the asset agreement; TSO licence; and transfer agreement in relation to staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The asset agreement between ESB as asset owner and EirGrid as transmission systems operator was approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, in October 2005. The agreement is required given the fact that ownership of the transmission grid assets is remaining with the ESB. The TSO licence has been finalised and published by CER but is not yet operational.

Pending finalisation of all the required steps, the CEO and some 70 directly recruited staff of EirGrid are temporarily seconded by that company to operate the grid through the ESB National Grid.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The harbour at Ballycotton is owned by Cork County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development is a matter for the local authority in the first instance. In 2001 the council submitted a report prepared by consulting engineers on the estimated cost a plan for development of Ballycotton harbour. The proposed development was estimated to cost a total of &euro;6 million.</P>
        <P>Cork County Council applied for funding in 2002 under the marine tourism grant scheme of the national development plan for a development including a marina at Ballycotton. However, as the applicants had not obtained the necessary statutory permissions, their application could not be considered further. The applicants were informed of this and that they could apply for funding under a future call.</P>
        <P>No funding was available for the marine tourism grant scheme in 2003, 2004 or 2005. The findings of the mid-term review of the regional operational programmes recommended reallocation of funds to other priorities. The allocation for the fishery harbours development programme is &euro;21 million for 2006. The fishery harbour programme involves co-funding by the local authorities.</P>
        <P>An updated proposal for development in three phases at Ballycotton was submitted by the local authority to the Department in October 2005. The estimated cost of phase one is &euro;2.5 million. Cork County Council would be required to contribute 25% funding to the project.</P>
        <P>There is no Exchequer funding available for Ballycotton phase one development in 2006. The question of providing funding in future years will have to be considered in the context of the available funding for fishery harbour works and overall national priorities.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government decision to transfer the maritime transport and maritime safety functions in their totality to the Department of Transport makes sound strategic and operational sense. These respective functions comprise interlinked policy areas and services which sit more appropriately within the overall transport framework. The assimilation of these functions into the broader transport policy framework is in the interests of integrated transport policy delivery, efficiency and effectiveness, and relevant stakeholders and sectors.</P>
        <P>The transfer of the functions concerned to the Department of Transport involved the transfer of 148 whole-time equivalent staff to that Department with the relevant functions with effect from 1 January 2006. A quantum of staff from central, corporate areas of my Department is also due to transfer to the Department of Transport by way of corporate support resources for the functions which transferred.</P>
        <P>The Abridged Estimates for 2006 for the Communications, Marine and Natural Resources Vote, as published in November 2005, made provision for maritime transport and maritime safety functions which transferred to the Department of Transport with effect from 1 January 2006. The Revised Estimates for 2006, which will be published in February, will reflect the transfer from the Communications, Marine and Natural Resources Vote to the Transport Vote of the financial provisions associated with the transferred functions. These provisions include funding in respect of the current and capital programmes for the Irish coast guard, maritime safety and marine regulation and seaports and the associated pay and administrative costs. Discussions involving the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of Transport and the Department of Finance are proceeding with a view to agreement on the funding to transfer to the Transport Vote in the context of finalisation of the Revised Estimates.</P>
        <P>The following fishery and marine-related functions remain within my Department &mdash; seafood policy and development; sea fisheries administration; seafood control; coastal zone management; engineering division; inland fisheries and marine leisure and research.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, these functions, with the exception of inland fisheries and marine leisure and research, are due to transfer to Clonakilty with my Department under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of renewable energy technologies is a key Government priority and a range of initiatives are being taken to encourage and incentivise the development of renewable energy. The new renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, programme, which I intend to launch shortly, will assist developers to construct new renewable energy powered electricity generating plants. The programme, which will cost in the region of &euro;119 <Col N="190"/>million over 15 years, will contribute to the doubling of renewable energy technologies in terms of total electricity production from approximately 5% of total consumption to more than 13% by 2010.</P>
        <P>Future targets beyond 2010 will be developed in the context of the all-island electricity market and in that context a public consultative process has been undertaken on an all-island vision for renewable energy to 2020 and beyond. The outcome of that consultation process will be reviewed with key industry players shortly coupled with further technical analysis, as well as available data on production and consumption trends to 2020, to assist in developing achievable targets for 2020.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, operates a number of capital investment support programmes and advice and information programmes which contribute to enhanced exploitation of renewable energy resources. These include the renewable energy RD&amp;D programme, the House of Tomorrow programme and the alternative energy measure. In the period 2000-2005 SEI has overseen expenditure of &euro;15.4 million on these programmes.</P>
        <P>The announcement on budget day of a five-year renewables package of &euro;65 million underlines this Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing renewable energy potential. Under this package I intend to launch a range of innovative grant schemes relating to biofuels, combined heat and power, biomass commercial heaters and domestic heat grants. An excise relief package for biofuels costing &euro;205 million from 2006 to 2010, together with funding to assist the development of indigenous biofuel plant is also being put in place. The amount of energy consumption met from by renewable fuel sources in 2004, the last full year for which figures are available is set out in the following table.</P><Col N="189"/>

        <Quest>the way in which gill netting in waters deeper than 200 m, banned in Areas VI and VII, will be enforced.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The ban on the use of deep water gill nets is set down in the 2006 total allowable catch, TAC, and quota regulation. Under this regulation, EU fishing vessels may no longer deploy gill nets, entangling nets or trammel nets at a depth of greater than 200 m in certain areas, including waters to the north, west and south west of Ireland. This includes parts of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, Areas VI and VII. While I understand the current ban is regarded by the EU Commission as a short-term emergency measure and that the Commission will bring forward long-term measures during the course of 2006, I will be at the forefront in pushing for the continuation of the current ban unless strong, effective alternative measures are brought forward by the Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The regulation requires the removal of such nets from the specified areas by 1 February 2006. It is, in the first instance, the responsibility of each member state with participants in the fishery concerned to ensure that their fishermen comply with the regulation within the specified time. The Naval Service will be responsible for policing the ban within the Irish exclusive fisheries zone, EFZ, and will monitor fishing activity in this zone to ensure that the banned gear is not deployed. New <Col N="192"/>EU rules came into force on 1 January 2006 which require that gill nets must be marked with the identification of the vessel to which it belongs, which will facilitate the work of the Naval Service in this regard. In EU waters outside the Irish EFZ, it will be the responsibility of the control authorities of each member state to monitor waters within their own EFZ, which are covered by the ban and in international waters, it will be a matter for the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission.</P>
        <P>There is also a significant problem, highlighted by the Deepnet report, of abandoned gear in relation to this fishery. Work has already been carried out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and UK Government agencies during 2005 to remove nets that have been discarded at sea and I will be pressing for an EU co-ordinated campaign to build upon this excellent work.</P>

	<P>I established a working group comprising people with experience of the postal sector, together with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the Irish spatial data infrastructure initiative, to examine the issue of the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland. This group produced its report last year.</P><Col N="193"/>
        <P>Following from the recommendations of the working group report, I asked the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to appoint project managers to support the postcode project by providing technical and economic advice including assessing the costs and benefits of the introduction of a postcode. ComReg, following a tendering process, has appointed both technical and economic consultants and these are being managed by a national postcode project board, comprising representatives of Departments, together with public and private sector organisations that I appointed last year.</P>
        <P>One constituent part of the consultants&rsquo; work programmes is that they engage in a process of stakeholder consultation with a view to arriving at a postcode model that best meets the needs of the stakeholders and measures the likely costs and benefits of the introduction of such a postcode. An extensive consultation process is currently under way and it is expected that the consultants will present by April next, a proposal to the national postcode project board that describes in sufficient detail, the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland. The board will then present its recommendation to me for my consideration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205, 223, 610 and 642 together.</P>
        <P>The Renewables Directive (2001/77/EC) obliges Ireland to develop and implement a programme capable of increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010.</P>
        <P>The target of 13.2% approximates to 1450 MW of installed generating capacity to be operational to the electricity network by 2010. Currently Ireland has approximately 750 MW of renewable capacity connected. This consists of approximately 490 MWs of wind powered plant, 240 MW of hydro powered plant with the balance &mdash; approximately 20 MWs &mdash; made up of different biomass technologies.</P>
        <P>The additional new capacity required to achieve the 1450 MWs target will be delivered by projects under the previous AER V and AER VI competitions and the new renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, programme. The new support programme will move from competitive tendering, AER, to a fixed price based system known as the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT. Following a public consultation process which has usefully informed the shape of the new programme, I expect to be in a position to launch the programme shortly.</P>
        <P>Following on the success of the pilot biofuels excise relief scheme which was launched last year, a further enhanced package of excise relief valued at &euro;205 million was agreed with the Minister for Finance and announced in the context of budget. The new excise relief programme is to be rolled out from this year to 2010 and will underpin achievement of the target of 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008. Funding is also being provided towards the capital cost of developing biofuels processing facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In line with the findings of the liquid biofuels strategy study published in 2004, a more detailed study on policy options for development of a biofuels market, including the possibility of a renewables obligation, has recently been commissioned. The study is being overseen by a steering group comprising members of the interdepartmental biofuels group.</P>
        <P>In the context of the recent budget I also secured a &euro;65 million multi-annual package to develop a sustained and better focus on renewable energy options for industry and the domestic market. I intend to launch a number of innovative grant schemes under this package as soon as possible. The schemes will relate to biofuels, combined heat and power, biomass commercial heaters and domestic renewable heat grants.</P>

        <Quest>the steps taken or likely to be taken to put in place sufficient gas and electricity interconnections, North-South and east-west with a view to ensuring adequacy and security of supplies and storage and a means whereby surplus electricity could be exported having particular regard to fluctuations likely in the event of interruption of supplies of gas or electricity throughout Europe and prolonged high usage here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Security of energy supply is a key policy objective. The relatively small size of our national electricity and gas markets underlines the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply, promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity and gas markets into the wider European market.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to the development of east-west electricity interconnection as a matter of priority. The Commission for Energy Regulation has been engaged in a process of rigorous exploration of the options for such development and I expect to receive advice from the commission on next steps shortly.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, both Governments endorsed plans put forward by the CER and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation for the construction of a second North-South electricity interconnector. Planning for the construction of the interconnector is under way with an operational date of 2012. Ireland has developed a high standard of security of gas supply, through good interconnection with the UK, encompassing two interconnections, to ensure sufficient importation capacity from external sources.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A South-North gas pipeline is also under construction, and is scheduled for commissioning in October 2006. The pipeline will extend from Gormanston County Meath to Belfast. Under section 19 of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the CER is required to prepare and publish an annual forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand on Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas system over a seven year period. The 2005 capacity statement includes a range of possible demand scenarios that may be expected to arise over the coming years. The scenarios incorporate various levels of demand, based on forecasts for the domestic, industrial and commercial, and power generation sectors, while also considering potential timeframes for new indigenous supply.</P>
        <P>The current gas capacity statement that our infrastructure is sufficiently robust to cater for the majority of scenarios modelled. Only in the case of the highest demand forecast would reinforce<Col N="196"/>ments to the infrastructure be envisaged within the period of this forecast.</P>
        <P>Developments in the UK market are closely monitored and this informs the ongoing assessment of security of supply policy. The Kinsale field continues to provide Ireland with an indigenous supply of gas and the potential for additional indigenous supplies when realised could reduce Ireland&rsquo;s import demands in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Turning to natural gas storage, in the context of the all-island energy market development framework, as part of the strategic goals enunciated, scope for a common approach on storage and liquefied natural gas within a timeframe of 2005 to 2007 has been identified. Work is progressing in bilateral discussions in both jurisdictions involving the Departments and regulatory authorities on the issue.</P>
        <P>Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the CER has the function of licensing natural gas storage facilities. In carrying out its functions, the commission must have regard to the need to secure that there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas.</P>
        <P>The CER is in discussion with Marathon Oil Ireland Limited about the development of natural gas storage facilities at south west Kinsale. The CER has recently completed a public consultation on the proposed regulatory regime for the storage facility. A further consultation on a natural gas storage licence will commence shortly. It is planned that the storage facility will be operational by the middle of 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, in its role as the natural gas transmission system operator, has developed contingency plans in the event of any curtailment in gas supplies. These plans include switching gas-fired power generation plant to alternative fuels, seeking voluntary reductions from large industrial gas consumers and utilising BGE&rsquo;s reserves from the south west Kinsale reservoir. BGE has estimated that, at current levels, the Kinsale reserves would supply 50% of non-daily metered customer requirements, that is, small business and domestic, for up to 50 days. This is in addition to stocks held in the UK.</P>
        <P>Under the umbrella of the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s task force on emergency procedures, BGE&rsquo;s contingency plans are being co-ordinated with the electricity transmission system operator so as to minimise the impact on power generation. There are no plans currently to export electricity or gas from Ireland to the wider European market.</P>

	<P>Security of supply in electricity is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in accordance with the provisions of article 28 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005. Article 28 provides that it shall be the duty of the Commission to monitor the security of supply of electricity and that the Commission shall take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply.</P>
        <P>In the performance of its functions the Commission is advised by EirGrid-ESB National Grid as the transmission system operator. The transmission system operator&rsquo;s report on generation adequacy has indicated that while power shortages are not anticipated, the margin between capacity and demand is tighter than normal this winter. The transmission system operator is working with generators to schedule necessary maintenance outages at times when margins are highest. It also expects at times to be able to call on electricity imported from Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom via Northern Ireland to supplement electricity production. Demand-side management measures and incentives are in place, particularly from November to February, to contain the demand for electricity at peak times. Appeals to the public to reduce demand at times of very low margin are a feature of the joint ESB-SEI energy efficiency campaign.</P>
        <P>In any emergency the transmission system operator, as part of its licence conditions, has in place a number of specific emergency plans to deal with an incident quickly and effectively. These include power system restoration and capacity shortfall plans, which involve,<i> inter alia</i>, matching supply to demand by load shedding while prioritising supply to critical users such as key telecommunications, security, communications, transportation and medical facilities. Suppliers have also negotiated interruptible contracts with major users who, in response to the price incentive, have organised their demand to be able to withstand interruption without loss of safety or critical functions. Details of these interruption loads are notified to the transmission system operator. Implementation of the plans is at the discretion and under the control of the transmission system operator.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The TACs and quotas for 2006 agreed by the Council of Fisheries Ministers in December 2005 were satisfactory from an Irish viewpoint and generally welcomed by the Irish industry. My main aim entering these negotiations was to secure a deal which gave Irish fishermen the best possible range of fishing opportunities for 2006, taking account of the socio-economic needs of the industry and the necessity to maintain a sustainable approach and rebuild certain key stocks.</P>
        <P>In terms of that outcome, I emphasise in particular the important increases secured in key whitefish quotas such as hake, monkfish and prawns. These species have a value towards the higher end of the price spectrum and the higher quotas achieved will be beneficial in delivering increased income to the Irish industry in 2006. Notwithstanding the impact of ongoing stock recovery plans, the prospects for the industry in 2006 are reasonably positive and a good, balanced package of fish quotas is available to the sector. Overall, total fish quotas, both for whitefish and pelagic species, are at a similar level to 2005. In aggregate, the total for whitefish is 33,901 tonnes and the total for pelagic species is 165,463 tonnes.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that I should take this opportunity to indicate to the House the very important contribution made to the December Council by the newly established regional advisory councils. The input to the decision-making process from the fishing industry, through these new councils, contributed significantly to what was a successful Council outcome.</P>

	<P>A date for analogue switch-off has not been set. Possible dates for analogue switch-off will be proposed as plans for a national roll-out of digital terrestrial television, DTT, are developed. I am committed to the long-term provision of a free-to-air DTT platform in Ireland. DTT can provide much more to the free-to-air viewer in terms of additional channels, improved quality of service and innovative new services, including data and interactivity.</P>
        <P>My Department is developing a DTT pilot which will begin this year. During the DTT pilot phase proposals for a national DTT roll-out will be developed. Free-to-air analogue terrestrial transmissions will continue for a period after the national roll-out of digital terrestrial television has begun. At a certain point analogue transmissions will be turned off and the full switch-over will then be complete. While the pilot is under way, I intend to hold comprehensive discussions with all relevant stakeholders around the development of a national roll-out plan and timing of analogue switch-off. A target date of 2012 for switch-off of analogue television services has been suggested by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>When decisions have been taken about the nature and timing of analogue switch-off, it will be necessary to ensure Irish viewers are fully informed of all the issues arising, such as issues around reception equipment replacement. All stakeholders will have a role in informing viewers of the likely changes. To receive digital television services viewers will need to have a set-top box &mdash; currently available in the United Kingdom at a cost of between &euro;50 and &euro;200 &mdash; or an integrated digital television. In some cases, viewers may need to make adjustments to rooftop aerials.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 640 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a member of the International Energy Agency &mdash; IEA &mdash; which,<i> inter alia</i>, monitors developments on the international oil market. The IEA keeps the oil market under constant review. As a member of the IEA, Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports of crude oil equivalent in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption. At 1 November 2005 Ireland&rsquo;s oil stock reserves were estimated at 106 days net imports. My Department has contingency arrangements in place to deal with major oil supply disruptions. In the event of a significant global oil supply crisis, Ireland&rsquo;s oil reserves would be extended over the period to supplement available, albeit reduced, commercial supplies. In this context reserves <Col N="208"/>provide cover for periods far in excess of their expression in terms of number of days.</P>
        <P>There would be no question of Ireland attempting to deal unilaterally with an international oil supply disruption. If such a crisis were to occur, the response, including the release of emergency stocks and the identification of alternative sources of supply, would take place within the framework of the formal emergency regime developed and maintained by the IEA. I am satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s emergency stock levels are sufficient to ensure we would be in a position to participate effectively in any internationally co-ordinated response in the event of an international oil supply disruption or manage any short-term disruption specifically impacting on the Irish market.</P>
        <P>In the context of the all-island energy market development framework the scope for a common approach on storage and liquefied natural gas is being progressed jointly in conjunction with both regulatory authorities. Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has the function of licensing natural gas storage facilities. In carrying out its functions the Commission must have regard to the need to ensure there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas.</P>
        <P>The CER is in discussion with Marathon Oil Ireland Ltd. regarding the development of natural gas storage facilities at south west Kinsale. The CER has recently completed a public consultation on the proposed regulatory regime for the storage facility. A further consultation on a natural gas storage licence will commence shortly. It is planned that the storage facility will be operational by the middle of 2006.</P>

However, as part of my overall policy-making role for the telecommunications sector, I keep the operations of all the bodies under the aegis of my Department under review and where improvements are necessary to develop the overall environment in which the sector operates, they will be made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that in November last I published details of the Government&rsquo;s new policy for the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector. This policy is based on the recommendations contained within the Farrell Grant Sparks report. The Government has decided that a fundamental restructuring of the sector is required. It considered that this reform would result in a better model for the State&rsquo;s role in the sector, better resource management, more and better involvement of stakeholders, better corporate governance and value for money.</P>
        <P>As the first step in the reform process, the Government has authorised the drafting of a Bill to establish a national inland fisheries authority, which will subsume the executive functions of the <Col N="210"/>central and regional fisheries boards. The new authority will play a key role in the transformation of the sector. The current fisheries boards will be transformed into regional advisory boards. These statutory bodies will focus on regional issues and will be widely consulted on the detailed implementation of the second phase in the restructuring process.</P>
        <P>I hope to have the legislation necessary for the establishment of the national inland fisheries authority and the national and regional advisory boards introduced in the D&aacute;il or Seanad before the summer recess. Naturally this timeframe depends on the complexity of the legislation under development.</P>
        <P>The Government also decided that the consultants should be re-engaged in 2006 to identify in more detail the structures, resources, funding and policy approaches needed to implement the further restructuring of the sector. The key principle informing this process is that of empowering local users and beneficiaries to take effective ownership of the resource. This process will involve full, transparent, comprehensive and patient consultations with all the stakeholders, during which the principles and structures to deliver the new model will be fleshed out. It will be an open and inclusive process aimed at achieving a consensual &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The Government remains fully committed to the peace process and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I will meet the British Prime Minister tomorrow with a view to reviewing recent developments and giving momentum to renewed efforts to restore the democratic institutions. There will be a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmenttal Conference on 1 February, which will be attended by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will convene talks with the Northern Ireland parties, commencing on 6 February.</P>

	<P>The total funds spent by my Department on consultants, legal experts and external advice from June 1997 to the end of 2005 are detailed as follows. The number of reports produced following such contracts and numbers of reports implemented by my Department are also detailed. It should be noted that a report would not have necessarily been produced as part of each consultancy engagement, for example, where there was implementation rather than advice involved, such as implementation of the financial management system. Also reports such as those containing results of surveys or research would not always result in the need for further implementation of recommendations. It should also be noted that some contracts are still ongoing and reports are yet to be produced.</P>
        <P>Planned expenditure for 2006, as detailed in the abridged Estimate, is &euro;243,000.</P><Col N="229"/>

There is a requirement to produce an annual corporate procurement plan as part of the national public procurement policy framework, which was issued by the Department of Finance in May 2005. In response to that requirement, my Department has commenced the process of developing a corporate procurement plan which will be completed this year. It is expected the analysis and evaluation of current processes which this will entail will provide an opportunity to identify and subsequently introduce any improved procurement practices which would assist the Department in maximising value for money in its procurement of goods and services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There are no records held by the Department concerning a &ldquo;Morning Star mother and baby unit&rdquo;. I understand there have been a number of references in parliamentary questions and the media to that unit concerning the case of one individual in relation to the Residential Institutions Redress Act. It is my understanding that the entity concerned is correctly titled as the &ldquo;Regina Coeli Hostel&rdquo; in North Brunswick Street, Dublin. Furthermore, the Department does not hold any files which suggest that there was a mother and baby unit within the Regina Coeli Hostel.</P>
        <P>A search of relevant files retrieved from the National Archives does not provide any clear evidence of what statutory function this Department had in relation to the inspection of the Regina Coeli Hostel or whether the hostel met the definition of a maternity home under the terms of the Registration of Maternity Homes Act 1934. These files are held by the National Archive and as such are available to the public as a matter of course. Should the Deputy require further information from these files, he may wish to contact the records management unit of this Department which will facilitate him in retrieving the files.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the Department of Health and Children advised the Department of Education that an inspection of files provided evidence of inspection or inspections of the Regina Coeli Hostel conducted on behalf of this <Col N="236"/>Department. The Department of Health and Children confirmed this to the Department of Education and Science in April 2005 and asked that consideration be given to the inclusion of the Regina Coeli Hostel under section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. The inclusion of institutions on the Schedule of the Act is a matter for the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has advised that for an institution to be considered for inclusion under section 4, it must be an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a children&rsquo;s home, a special school for children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness. It must also be one in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function. The Department of Education and Science further advises that hostels are not one of the categories of institutions listed as institutions which can be considered and, as such, it is not open to consider the inclusion of the Regina Coeli Hostel in the Schedule. That Department has further advised that the question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule.</P>

	<P>An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, the Registrar General, is the person with statutory responsibility for the administration of the civil registration system. I have made inquiries with an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir and the position is as set out as follows. An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir maintains a national index of births in electronic format, which is available in the offices of registrars of births, deaths and marriages employed by the Civil Registration Service. Ideally, to search this index the applicant should know the date and place of birth, forename of the person concerned and the parents&rsquo; names. However, it may be possible to locate the relevant entry if only some of these details are available.</P>
        <P>Where it is established that a birth has not been previously registered, it is possible, under the provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004, to effect registration, provided the particulars required by law to be registered are available. In cases where the parents or any other qualified informant with knowledge of the required particulars failed to register a birth within 12 months of the event, the consent of a superintendent registrar of births, deaths and marriages is <Col N="237"/>required to effect registration. Where the parents are deceased or incapable or cannot be found and where no other qualified informant with knowledge of the required particulars can be found, an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir may cause the birth to be registered on production of adequate evidence of the details of the birth.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.6- ?>
        <P>I understand that the minimum information required to be entered in the birth register is the forename or forenames and the surname, date and exact place of birth, the parents&rsquo; names or at least the mother&rsquo;s name and the marital status of the parents. In relation to the birth referred to by the Deputy, it cannot be ascertained from the details supplied which registrar was approached concerning this matter and whether the person concerned had sufficient information to locate an entry in the register or had adequate knowledge of the required particulars to effect a registration. I suggest the person concerned contact an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir directly in writing and he will assist in any way possible concerning this matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 295 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that there have been a number of career developments in recent years to attract speech and language therapists to the public health services. These include the implementation of recommendations made by the expert group on various health professions which included new pay scales and enhanced career structures. In general, developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have all supported increased staffing levels for key health and social care professions, including speech and language thera<Col N="238"/>pists. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body made a further important contribution to recruitment and improved retention. The continued implementation of the action plan for people management &mdash; a key action under the health strategy &mdash; has a crucial role in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled staff.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy in the public health service. The success of these measures has contributed to an increase of 162 speech and language therapists or 42% over the number employed at the end of December 2000 and reflects significant increases in the numbers employed in promotional grades. There were 548 whole-time equivalent speech and language therapists employed in the public health service at the end of September 2005.</P>
        <P>In addition, three new speech and language therapy courses commenced in the 2003-04 academic year in University College Cork, the National University of Ireland Galway and the University of Limerick. In total, these courses provide an additional 75 training places in speech and language therapy. This expansion in training numbers was identified in the Bacon report as sufficient to meet the long-term demand-supply balance for speech and language therapists. The first graduates from the two year masters course in the University of Limerick completed their studies in June 2005. The first graduates from the BSc courses in UCC and NUIG will graduate in 2007.</P>
        <P>Essential to the successful roll-out of these additional training places is the provision of sufficient quality clinical placements in speech and language therapy. The funding I have provided this year along with that allocated in the past two years will enable the Health Service Executive, working with my Department, to put in place the enhanced structures necessary to ensure students will have access to a sustainable, high quality clinical training model.</P>

To date no reply has been received.</P>
        <P>Counselling is available to people through the health services. Local GPs should have a list of counsellors that they could recommend. Alternatively, the general manager, community care, HSE northern area, Cromcastle Road, Coolock, Dublin 5, Tel. 01-816033, will be able to help.</P>

	<P>An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, the Registrar General, is the person with statutory responsibility for the administration of the civil registration system in Ireland, including the registration of marriages. I have made inquiries with an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir and the position is as follows. The Civil Registration Bill 2003 was enacted as the Civil Registration Act 2004 in February 2004. The Act provides for the commencement of the various provisions on a gradual basis. Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Act, which relate to the administration of the service and the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths, were commenced on 5 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The new provisions for marriage are set out in Part 6 of the Act and include universal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages, as well as a choice of venue for civil marriage ceremonies. Before the provisions can be commenced, a substantial body of work needs to be completed, including drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; establishment of a register of approved venues for civil marriages; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage provisions introduced in the Act. An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir is unable to give a specific date for the implementation of the new marriage procedures but it is unlikely to be before October 2006.</P>
        <P>Upon commencement of the new marriage provisions, all marriages taking place in the State, civil or religious and irrespective of the nationality of the participants, will be entered in the register of marriages, provided that the regulations and procedures provided for under the Act are adhered to. There are no provisions in the Act to allow any marriage solemnised under the legislation to be exempted from registration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 and 273 together.</P>
        <P>Avian influenza or bird flu is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. The Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for controlling avian influenza in birds and mammals other than humans. That Department has put in place a range of measures aimed at maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s avian flu-free status and all questions relating to these measures should be referred to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan.</P>
        <P>According to the World Health Organisation, the spread of the H5N1 virus to poultry in new areas since late 2003 is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur. However, all evidence to date indicates that the H5N1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans. The WHO level of pandemic alert remains unchanged at phase 3: a virus new to humans is causing infections, but does not spread easily from one person to another.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Health Service Executive are closely monitoring avian influenza developments with particular reference to the public health implications. The HSE health protection surveillance centre has published guidance for the health system for use in the event of an avian influenza outbreak in animals in Ireland. Guidance on the investigation and management of suspected human cases of avian influenza is also available on <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The overall aims of influenza pandemic planning are to reduce mortality and morbidity and minimise the resulting disruption to society. However, the consequences of a global pandemic are still likely to be serious. Pandemic planning can only mitigate the effects and my Department and the Health Service Executive are working closely together on pandemic planning. A model plan for influenza pandemic preparedness was finalised in 2002 and was based on best practice at that time. The influenza pandemic expert group is updating the expert guidance contained in this plan. In addition, a generic public health emergency plan for the health system was prepared in <Col N="242"/>2004. This included disease specific operational response plans, ORPs, in relation to SARS, pandemic influenza and smallpox.</P>
        <P>These ORPs identify key actions which must be undertaken before and during a major public health threat. The responses are structured within the following functional areas &mdash; surveillance, health services, public health measures, vaccines-antivirals, etc., communications, laboratories and materials management.</P>
        <P>The pandemic influenza operational response plan is being updated to reflect the most up to date advice of the influenza pandemic expert group and the World Health Organisation, WHO. My Department is also in the process of establishing a standing interdepartmental committee to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of an influenza pandemic, for example, border controls and suspension of travel, travel advices, school closures, suspension of other gatherings, possible security issues, etc. This committee will assist my Department with planning for such an emergency and will also be available in the event of an emergency arising.</P>
        <P>Vaccination will be the primary public health intervention in the event of an influenza pandemic and our plans to deal with a pandemic call for vaccines to be provided to cover the entire population as soon as a vaccine is available. Since influenza pandemics occur when a new flu virus emerges to which people have no immunity, the vaccine can only be manufactured once the new strain emerges.</P>
        <P>Despite developments taking place at international level seeking to expedite the pandemic vaccine production process, it is anticipated that it will take at least four to six months from the time a pandemic flu strain emerges to develop and manufacture a vaccine. My Department is therefore pursuing an advanced purchase order for a pandemic strain vaccine. A vaccine is in development which could offer some protection against an H5N1 flu strain. International experts consider that a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine could be used as a first line of defence for priority groups while a vaccine against the exact pandemic influenza strain is manufactured. My Department is actively pursuing the purchase of a limited supply of this vaccine.</P>
        <P>The main treatment for pandemic influenza is antiviral drugs. Antivirals can shorten the duration of the disease and alleviate symptoms. They are not usually considered effective after 48 hours from the onset of illness. An emergency supply of more than 45,000 treatment packs of antivirals &mdash; Tamiflu &mdash; was purchased in 2004. A further 1 million treatment packs of antivirals &mdash; Tamiflu &mdash; are being stockpiled. This quantity is sufficient to treat 25% of the population. Approximately 600,000 packs have already been delivered. The remaining 400,000 packs will be delivered in 2006.</P>

As part of this provision, funding is being made available to address core under-funding and core staffing issues in services provided by the non-statutory sector. The Health Service Executive will be asked to allocate this funding on an equitable basis, having regard to the needs of people with disabilities. I expect that the executive&rsquo;s consideration of these needs will take into account those services which are currently staffed through community employment schemes.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As the matters raised by the Deputy relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and have a reply issued directly to the Deputy. My Department&rsquo;s quarterly health service personnel census collects employment information solely on the basis of grade and employing authority rather than on a county basis. However, the Deputy will wish to note that for the period between 31 December 1997 and ending 30 September 2005, the number of social workers employed in the public health service increased by 897 to 2,061 or 77% in whole-time equivalent terms. The following table shows a breakdown of these figures by Health Service Executive area for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.</P><Col N="243"/>

	<P>The question of whether possession and sale of magic mushrooms in their raw state is an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts is being considered in the context of a case before the DPP.</P>
        <P>It is clearly an offence to possess or sell products or preparations containing the psychoactive drug present in magic mushrooms: the only question is whether this definition covers raw mushrooms. In the UK, it became apparent that raw mushrooms were not covered and this resulted in a change in their legislation earlier this year.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the issue in the Department, secondary legislation is being prepared which will remove any doubt that magic mushrooms in their raw state are controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act, and that the possession or sale of magic mushrooms is a criminal offence.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative is a ten year strategy which was launched by the Taoiseach in October of last year. At that time, the Government welcomed the goals and aims of the initiative and it is clear that the strategy is the result of an enormous amount of work at community level.</P>
        <P>The objective of the strategy is to improve children&rsquo;s health, safety, learning and achieving and to increase their sense of community belonging. The Government has put a number of initiatives in place with the ultimate aim of improving children&rsquo;s lives in areas such as west Tallaght. As a Government designated geographic area of disadvantage, namely, a RAPID area, it has been estimated that approximately &euro;27 million was spent in the year 2004-05 by statutory bodies on children&rsquo;s services in the part of it covered by the strategy. The project recognises this. This is a substantial sum in the area concerned. Developments through this and other programmes in the areas of education, health and youth justice at national level are mirrored in the approach outlined in the childhood development initiative&rsquo;s ten-year strategy.</P>
        <P>A number of meetings between representatives of this and other related projects have already taken place with the relevant Departments&rsquo; officials.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is referring to the provision of a forensic psychiatric facility for children and young people with psychiatric problems coming into contact with the law.</P>
        <P>The report of the expert group on mental health policy, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, was published yesterday. The report acknowledges that there are a number of troubled children and adolescents in community settings who come before the courts. The report has recommended that a dedicated residential ten bed facility with a fully resourced child and adolescent mental health team should be provided with a national remit. It also recommends that an additional community-based, child and adolescent forensic mental health team should be provided. The Government has accepted the expert group&rsquo;s report as the basis for the future development of the mental health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More than &euro;200 million has been invested in child welfare and protection services since 1997. A range of services is provided by the Health Service Executive to address the needs of a relatively small number of non-offending children in need of special care or protection, including intensive community based services designed to reduce the need for secure placement, such as the youth advocacy programmes, as well as specialised residential high support and special care secure units.</P>

	<P>There are no records held by the Department concerning a &ldquo;Morning Star mother and baby unit&rdquo;. There has been a number of references in parliamentary questions and in the media to the above unit concerning the case of one individual and the Residential Institutions Redress Act. The entity concerned is correctly titled as the Regina Coeli hostel in North Brunswick Street, Dublin. Furthermore, the Department does not hold any files <Col N="251"/>which suggest that there was a mother and baby unit within the Regina Coeli hostel.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A search of files retrieved from the National Archives reveals that the first record of any inspection conducted on behalf of the Department was in 1946. The inspection referred to records that the hostel catered for destitute poor, girls unable to get lodgings and unmarried mothers. These files are held by the National Archives and as such are available to the public as a matter of course. Should the Deputy require further information from these files he may wish to contact the records management unit of this Department which will facilitate him in retrieving the files.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Health and Children advised the Department of Education and Science that an inspection of files provided evidence of inspection(s) of the Regina Coeli hostel conducted on behalf of this Department. The Department of Health and Children confirmed this to the Department of Education and Science in April 2005 and asked that consideration be given to the inclusion of the Regina Coeli Hostel under section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. The inclusion of institutions in the Schedule of the Act is a matter for the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has advised that for an institution to be considered for inclusion under section 4, it must be an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a children&rsquo;s home, a special school for children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness. It must also be one in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function. The Department of Education and Science further advises that hostels are not one of the categories of institutions which are listed as institutions which can be considered and as such it is not open to consider the inclusion of the Regina Coeli Hostel in the Schedule.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That Department has further advised that the question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule.</P>

        <P Just="Left">This Department has also funded a research project which involves a review of maternal records held by the Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital for the period 1996-2004. The aims of the project are: to describe the prevalence and patterns of alcohol and nicotine use in a sample of pregnant women in Ireland between 1986 and 2004; to examine the association between a set of pregnancy outcome indicators &mdash; birth weight, Apgar score &mdash; and the consumption patterns; and to examine how alcohol consumption in Ireland, in a sample of pregnant women, relates to use in a similar population in other countries. The results are expected to be available later this year and will inform any future action required.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is referring to a private arrangement between family members. As these children have not been formally placed in foster care by the Health Service Executive, any concerns regarding the arrangement would be a matter for family law. However, if there are concerns regarding the health, welfare or safety of the children, the Child Care Act 1991 would apply. Under the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991, the Health Service Executive has an obligation to take a child into care if the child requires care or protection.</P>
        <P>Private foster care arrangements, excluding family arrangements where a child is in the care of a relative, are governed under the Children Act 2001. Under the Act, the Health Service Executive must be notified of such arrangements and the Health Service Executive has the authority to investigate the care and attention that the child is receiving and to act accordingly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 291 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition for the treatment of that condition, through the long term illness scheme, LTI. The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are mental handicap, mental illness for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is responsible for assessing the eligibility of applicants for the LTI. Once accepted into the scheme, it is a matter for each patient to avail of the benefits of the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The medical card, GMS, and drugs payment, DPS, schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In November 2004, the Government provided funding for an additional 30,000 medical cards, and for 200,000 new GP visit cards, which allow holders to receive general practitioner services free of charge. In June last year, I simplified the means test for both medical and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. On 13 October 2005, I announced that the income guidelines for both medical and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than prior to these measures.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI, can use the DPS. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

        <P FLI="0">A simple comparison of these figures does not take account of the fact that in the period covered by the Deputy&rsquo;s question, data cleansing exercises were undertaken by the former health boards. These occurred in 1998 at the time of the introduction of the new form laminated medical card and in 2002-03. The exercises sought to identify inaccuracies on GMS medical card databases. The recent exercise resulted in the removal of in excess of 104,000 invalid entries nationally. If allowance is made for the effect of these necessary exercises, there has been a net increase in the number of medical cards in recent years throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Since 2005 I have made significant improvements to the way on which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. In January 2005, I increased the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications by 7.5%.</P>
        <P>In June 2005, it was apparent that the effect of rising income in our successful economy meant that the target of 30,000 additional medical cards was not going to be achieved. At this time I simplified the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. This is much fairer to applicants.</P>
        <P>I announced on 13 October 2005, that the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than they were at the end of 2004. These substantial increases in the assessment guidelines will allow many more people to visit their family doctor free of charge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department and the Health Service Executive will continue to monitor the number of <Col N="260"/>cards issued. The Government&rsquo;s commitment in the programme for Government to extend eligibility for medical cards will be kept under review in the light of other competing service priorities, available resources and the graduated benefits approach which I introduced with the GP visit card.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 301 and 333 together.</P>
        <P>Section 42 of the Health Act 2004 provides for the establishment of not more than four regional health fora, the membership of which is composed of members nominated by city and county councils. The regulations providing for the establishment of the regional health forums &mdash; the Health Act 2004 (Regional Health Forums) Regulations 2005 &mdash; were published on 12 December 2005 and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 14 December 2005. The regulations provided for the establishment of the fora on 1 January 2006. It will be the responsibility of the Health Service Executive to convene the first meeting of the each forum which must take place not later than four weeks after the final member of each forum has been appointed.</P>
        <P>The function of the regional health fora, as set out in the 2004 Act, is to provide local public representatives with an opportunity to make representations to the Health Service Executive on the range and operation of health and personal social services in their area. The establishment of these fora demonstrates this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that local public representatives will continue to be heard in relation to the operation and development of health and personal social services in their areas. The fora will complement the role of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in the ongoing oversight of the health services.</P>
        <P>The titles of each forum, its functional area, the number of members of each forum and the numbers of members to be nominated by the city and county councils to each forum are specified in the regulations and are set out. Each city and <Col N="262"/>county council has been allocated a number of representatives based on the range in which the population of its area falls into. The regulations provide that the appointment of members to the fora will be undertaken using a grouping system similar to that provided for in the Local Government Act 2001. </P>

	<P>In accordance with the provisions of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, the position of Ombudsman for Children was advertised in the national papers on 6 and 7 November with a closing date for completed applications of 19 November 2003. The recruitment was by way of an open competition run by the Public Appointments Commission. In line with the national children&rsquo;s strategy, children and young people were involved in the advertising and selection process. Following a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Ombudsman for Children was appointed by the President on 18 December 2003 and the office was formally established on 25 April 2004.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman for Children currently has seven members of staff. Four of these posts are filled by staff seconded from the Department of Health and Children to provide administrative support and the remaining three posts were filled by way of open competitions. Accordingly, all staff have been recruited through the Public Appointments Service, which seeks references as part of the selection and recruitment process.</P>

        <P>In light of the considerable volume of legislation in respect of medicinal products, arising from this country&rsquo;s EU obligations, which is currently being prepared by the Department, it is not expected that the steps necessary for the full implementation of Directive 2005/28/EC will be completed until later in the year.</P>

In recognition of this, a project team was established to plan for the overall future development of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, either on the existing hospital site or at an alternative green field location.</P>
        <P>The project team has undertaken a detailed examination of the potential to redevelop the hospital on its present site. The project team concluded that the existing clinical services could be retained and developed on the present site but also set out the implications of such an approach in terms of time, cost and disruption to services. As a consequence it is likely that the new hospital will be located at an alternative site.</P>
        <P>I asked the Health Service Executive to arrange for a review to be undertaken of highly specialised paediatric services to ensure that they are provided in the most efficient and effective manner. The HSE recently engaged a team of management consultants to provide a report on the strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services in Ireland. Specifically, the report is to identify whether tertiary paediatric services should be provided on one or more sites, the facilities required to meet tertiary needs and the facilities required to meet secondary &mdash; less complex &mdash; paediatric services in Dublin.</P>
        <P>This review is ongoing and the HSE expects to receive the consultants&rsquo; report by the end of <Col N="269"/>January. The outcome will help to inform the decisions in relation to the future location and the range of services to be provided at the new hospital.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In 2005 the health promotion unit of this Department spent approximately &euro;2 million on anti-smoking measures including media campaigns and the national smokers quitline. There was a growth of 3.6% on the sales of tobacco tax stamps, which equates to almost 193 million cigarettes, during the same period. The office of tobacco control monitors cigarette smoking prevalence and behaviour on a monthly basis and recent data show that smoking prevalence has decreased from 27% in 2002 to 23.98% in October 2005. The office also argues that it is inaccurate to make a direct correlation between revenue take and cigarette consumption due to the manner in which excise duty on tobacco is collected.</P>

	<P>Information on membership vacancies in statutory bodies, where appointments are made by the Minister for Health and Children, is shown in the following table.

The information contained in the table takes into account the full membership potential of the body.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The process by which a person is appointed to a State board or body reflects the conditions for the appointment laid down in the relevant statutory instrument or Act. Nominations under the aegis of my Department can arise in different ways. Some members are nominated by prescribed bodies, individual office holders or organisations and others are appointed by the Minister <Col N="271"/>for Health and Children, having due regard to the nature of the work of the body and the consequent requirement for any appointee to hold the necessary skills and expertise required to discharge the functions of that particular body. <Col N="272"/>The time required to appoint members therefore varies.</P>

        <P Just="Left">A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision by general practitioners of primary care services is being conducted at present, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. The new contractual framework to be agreed must provide for the provision of high quality, person-centred services and for a greater proportion of people&rsquo;s health care needs to be met in the primary care setting. Among the matters to be explored in the course of this process is the expansion of the range of services provided by general practitioners, potentially to include the management of certain chronic conditions and the development of structured preventative and screening programmes.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children,</askee>
        <Quest> further to the budget increase for care of older persons and the development of the nursing home subvention, what the new weekly rates of subvention will be; when same will become effective; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1308/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 on foot of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993, which were made under section 7 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. These regulations laid down the criteria for assessing a person&rsquo;s eligibility for subvention, as well as the maximum amounts of subvention that may be paid to an eligible person.</P>
        <P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 are administered by the Health Service <Col N="278"/>Executive. There are three rates of subvention payable for three levels of dependency, namely, medium at &euro;114.30, high at &euro;152.40 and maximum at &euro;190.50. Included in these payments is an increase of 25% which came into effect in April 2001. These rates remain in effect and were unchanged on budget day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention subject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. Additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the scheme for 2006, bringing the total available budget to &euro;160 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Certain thresholds were set in the 1993 regulations relating to the means and assets of a person applying for a subvention. These thresholds had not been updated since they were set in 1993. Amendment regulations, the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 2005, altered thresholds set in the 1993 regulations. These amendments increased the threshold of assets to be disregarded for the purposes of subvention assessment from &pound;6,000, &euro;7,618, to &euro;11,000 and those above which subvention may be refused from &pound;20,000, &euro;25,394, to &euro;36,000. They also increased the threshold of principal residence value above which subvention may be refused from &pound;75,000, &euro;95,230, to &euro;500,000 or more where the residence is located in the Dublin area or &euro;300,000 or more where the residence is located outside the Dublin area, provided that the applicant&rsquo;s income is greater than &euro;9,000, previously &pound;5,000 or &euro;6,349.</P>
        <P>The HSE continues to retain the discretion to impute an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension and generally does so save in exceptional circumstances. However, the residence value above which the HSE may automatically refuse to pay a subvention has been increased substantially, as outlined, to take account of increased property values.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment regulations were signed by the T&aacute;naiste on 14 December 2005 and were effective in law from that date. Under section 14 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, once the regulations are made, they must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, either of which can pass a resolution to annul the regulations within the next 21 days on which the House sits.</P><Col N="279"/>
        <P>Following the publication of the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs was established. The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. The report of the group has been submitted to Government.</P>

	<P>Tackling the problems associated with health care associated infections, including MRSA, continues to be a priority for my Department and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>I recently wrote to Professor Drumm, chief executive of the Health Service Executive, regarding issues raised by the relatives and vic<Col N="281"/>tims of MRSA at our meeting. With regard to the communication of information to patients infected with MRSA, my Department understands that the HSE intends to issue a direction to hospitals on this matter. The HSE is reviewing the national policy on hospital visiting times with a view to issuing revised guidance to hospitals. With regard to the discharge from hospital of patients with MRSA, the HSE is considering how best to ensure that good practice and the proper procedures are followed in all such cases.</P>
        <P>The publication of the revised SARI guidelines on the control and prevention of MRSA in hospitals and in the community, the clean hands campaign, the national hygiene audits and the development of national standards for infection control and hospital hygiene are some of the measures aimed at bringing about change in the hospital system. The HSE has announced that the second national hygiene audit of acute hospitals will commence in February and will assess the extent of the improvements made at hospital level since the publication of the first audit report.</P>
        <P>It is now a matter for the HSE to continue to develop and implement the necessary strategies needed to ensure the effective control of health care associated infections.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the assessment of a person for nursing home subvention in relation to the value of their residence; if a house as valued under figures provided in budget 2006 will no longer be taken into account when assessing an applicant&rsquo;s eligibility for nursing home subvention; and if she will make statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1333/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 on foot of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993, which were made under section 7 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. These <Col N="283"/>regulations laid down the criteria for assessing a person&rsquo;s eligibility for subvention, as well as the maximum amounts of subvention that may be paid to an eligible person.</P>
        <P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are three rates of subvention payable for three levels of dependency, namely, medium at &euro;114.30, high at &euro;152.40 and maximum at &euro;190.50. Included in these payments is an increase of 25% which came into effect in April 2001. These rates remain in effect and were unchanged on budget day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention subject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. Additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the scheme for 2006, bringing the total available budget to &euro;160 million.</P>
        <P>Certain thresholds were set in the 1993 regulations relating to the means and assets of a person applying for a subvention. These thresholds had not been updated since they were set in 1993. Amendment regulations, the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 2005, altered thresholds set in the 1993 regulations. These amendments increased the threshold of assets to be disregarded for the purposes of subvention assessment from &pound;6,000, &euro;7,618, to &euro;11,000 and those above which subvention may be refused from &pound;20,000, &euro;25,394, to &euro;36,000. They also increased the threshold of principal residence value above which subvention may be refused from &pound;75,000, &euro;95,230, to &euro;500,000 or more where the residence is located in the Dublin area or &euro;300,000 or more where the residence is located outside the Dublin area, provided that the applicant&rsquo;s income is greater than &euro;9,000, previously &pound;5,000 or &euro;6,349.</P>
        <P>The HSE continues to retain the discretion to impute an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension and generally does so save in exceptional circumstances. However, the residence value above which the HSE may automatically refuse to pay a subvention has been increased substantially, as outlined, to take account of increased property values.</P><Col N="284"/>
        <P>The amendment regulations were signed by the T&aacute;naiste on 14 December 2005 and were effective in law from that date. Under section 14 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, once the regulations are made, they must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, either of which can pass a resolution to annul the regulations within the next 21 days on which the House sits.</P>
        <P>Following the publication of the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs was established. The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. The report of the group has been submitted to Government.</P>

	<P>The Mater and children&rsquo;s hospital development is the largest single capital development project in the HSE capital programme. It involves the redevelopment of the Mater campus to include considerably expanded and improved facilities for the Mater itself and the construction of new, purpose-built accommodation which will <Col N="285"/>replace the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>In the context of the decision to be taken on the possible relocation of the facilities at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, I asked the Health Service Executive to undertake a review of tertiary or highly specialised paediatric services to ensure that paediatric services are provided in the most efficient and effective manner. The HSE recently engaged a team of management consultants to provide a report on the strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services in Ireland. Specifically, the report is to identify whether tertiary paediatric services should be provided on one or more sites, the facilities required to meet tertiary needs and the facilities required to meet secondary, that is, less complex, paediatric services in Dublin.</P>
        <P>This review clearly has implications for the scope of the Mater and children&rsquo;s hospital development project and the HSE has advised the hospital that it needs to await the report before giving approval for the project to proceed to tender. The HSE expects to receive the consultant&rsquo;s report by the end of this month and my Department will have further discussions with the HSE at that stage to see how to advance the development project. My primary concern is to ensure that we arrive at a solution which is in the best interests of the children of this country.</P>

	<P>I am committed to the national roll-out of the cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. An international expert examined the feasibility and implications of a national roll-out of a cervical <Col N="286"/>screening programme. The examination included an evaluation of the current pilot programme, quality assurance, laboratory capacity and the establishment of national governance arrangements.</P>
        <P>Following the publication of this report my Department undertook a consultative process with relevant professional and advocacy stake holders. The consultative process is complete and there is considerable support for the programme roll out and agreement on the need for improved organisation, quality assurance and governance arrangements to support a national roll-out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I made an additional &euro;9 million available to the Health Service Executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for a national programme.

A design team has been appointed to work on detailed plans for two new clinical units, one at the South Infirmary, Victoria Hospital, Cork and one at University College Hospital, Galway. It is anticipated that, subject to obtaining satisfactory planning approval, the design process,  including the preparation of the tender documentation, will be completed by mid-2006, following which construction on both sites can commence.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck has advertised for lead consultant radiologists and radiographers for the two new units. The recruitment for other key clinical posts will commence shortly. The exact time lines for the roll-out will depend largely on the success of this recruitment process. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of 2007 for commencement of the roll-out will be met.</P>

	<P>The 2005 annual report from the national intellectual disability database committee indicates that of the additional residential and respite services required to meet the needs of those registered on the database, the majority of new services are of an immediate nature, as outlined by the Deputy. However it should also be noted that the majority of these individuals are already in receipt of a major element of service. For example, of the overall total of 2,270 people who require a major element of service in the period 2006 to 2010, 86.9% are already in receipt of at least one major element of service such as a day service.</P>
        <P>An integral part of the national disability strategy is the multi-annual investment programme, published in December 2004 by the Government, which contains details of specific commitments regarding the provision of specific high priority disability services over the period 2006 to 2009. These commitments include the development of new residential, respite and day places for persons with intellectual disabilities and autism in each of the years covered by the programme.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;59 million is being provided in 2006 to meets costs associated with the various elements of this programme. This funding will be used to put in place 255 new residential <Col N="289"/>places, 85 new respite places and 535 new day places for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, and also to progress the programme to transfer persons with intellectual disabilities and autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</P>
        <P>In addition to the specific high profile disability services included in the programme outlined above, further additional funding of &euro;41 million is being provided to enhance the multidisciplinary support services for people with disabilities in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to build capacity within the health services to deliver on the various legislative provisions contained in the national disability strategy. Capital funding of &euro;55 million is also being provided in 2006 to support these developments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362, 457, 459, 460 and 463, together.</P>
        <P>The report of the national task force on medical staffing, known as the Hanly report, makes a series of important recommendations about the development of hospital services. These covered <Col N="290"/>issues such as the changes needed in non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, work patterns, reform of medical education and training, the need for a significantly revised contract for medical consultants and an increase in the number of consultants and the reorganisation of acute hospital services.</P>
        <P>In the debate about the future organisation of acute hospital services, it is important to remember that we are obliged to implement the European working time directive, which involves a considerable, and welcome, reduction in the working hours of NCHDs. We need to find alternative ways of providing services in our acute hospitals so that doctors can work reasonable hours and patients can be sure of a top quality service at all times.</P>
        <P>This means looking carefully at how we configure our acute services but it certainly does not mean closing hospitals or downgrading them. There is substantial scope for increasing the services provided in many hospitals such as Ennis. We need to harness the potential of every acute hospital to provide the best possible service to the local community.</P>
        <P>We must decentralise as much as possible of the elective treatments currently provided in the larger acute hospitals to smaller hospitals. If properly structured and developed, the smaller hospitals could take on significantly more of these treatments. Far from reducing the importance of smaller hospitals, the Government is committed to expanding considerably the services that can safely be provided within local communities.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to supporting and developing critical services, including key areas such as accident and emergency services in hospitals, which should open in line with patient need.</P>
        <P>We are committed to developing facilities at Ennis General Hospital under the first phase of the capital developments proposed, which will include new and upgraded facilities in ward areas, radiology, accident and emergency, and out-patients.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has been given the task of developing regional hospital services based on the recommendations of the task force report. The key priority is to ensure that patients, wherever they live, have access to high quality hospital care.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The system of industrial relations <Col N="300"/>in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature. The State has established a number of institutions to assist in the resolution of trade disputes between employers and workers, comprising the Labour Relations Commission, the rights commissioner service and the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission&rsquo;s conciliation service is a voluntary mediation process. In this process, a professional mediator assists employers and employees to resolve disputes when their own efforts to do so have not succeeded. The process can be described as a facilitated search for agreement between parties in dispute. Where the process ends in continuing disagreement the parties have the option of referring the dispute to the Labour Court for a recommendation.</P>
        <P>Rights commissioners investigate trade disputes referred by individuals or small groups of workers. Having carried out an investigation, a rights commissioner issues a recommendation, which is not binding on the parties involved, giving his or her opinion on the merits of the dispute. A party to a dispute under the Industrial Relations Acts may appeal against a rights commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation to the Labour Court. The decision of the court on such appeals is binding on the parties to the dispute.</P><Col N="301"/>
        <P>The Labour Court conducts hearings on trade disputes and then issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled. In accordance with the voluntarist nature of the industrial relations machinery in this country, the Labour Court cannot compel a company to comply with its recommendations. As the Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, that is, the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
        <P>Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969 provides a means whereby a case can be brought directly to the Labour Court without having been previously heard by a rights commissioner. To refer a case to the Labour Court under this section, however, the party or parties referring the case must agree in advance that they will accept the recommendation of the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute. The law on industrial relations disputes does not seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but to assist them in arriving at a solution.</P>

	<P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long-stay charges for publicly funded residential care. All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were wrongly charged and are dead since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to the aforementioned date. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the consumer price index, since the time the person involved was charged.</P>
        <P>Draft heads of a Bill for a repayment scheme were submitted to Government in December and were approved. The draft heads have been submitted to the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and it is my intention to have the Bill published in the current parliamentary session and to have <Col N="304"/>repayments commencing shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law.</P>
        <P>The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified as a result of initial payments made following my announcement in December 2004. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process.</P>

	<P>The Government has taken a planned approach to building up capacity in the area of multidisciplinary support service for both adults and children with disabilities. This includes, in addition to the provision of additional financial resources, various initiatives related to the training, recruitment and retention of key allied health professionals as follows: the expansion of the number of training places available for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, nursing and other key professionals; and national and overseas recruitment initiatives and enhancement of career opportunities.</P>
        <P>The level of support available form these health related support services to children with <Col N="310"/>physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities and autism has been incrementally increasing annually in recent years as a result of the additional funding which has been made available by this Government. An integral part of the national disability strategy is the implementations of the provisions of the two major legislative measures which have been enacted recently, the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, both of which have very significant implications for the planning and delivery of health and personal social services for people with disabilities. Additional funding of &euro;155 million has been allocated to services for people with disabilities in 2006. Of this funding, &euro;59 million is being provided to meet costs associated with the various elements of this programme.</P>
        <P>Further additional funding amounting to &euro;41 million is being used to enhance the multidisciplinary support services for people with disabilities, in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to build capacity within the health services to deliver on the various legislative provisions contained on the national disability strategy. As outlined in the multi-annual investment programme 2006-2009, additional capital funding amounting to &euro;55 million is also being provided in 2006 to support these developments.</P>

	<P>The office of the Minister with responsibility for children is being established in accordance with the Government decision of 7 December 2005 to place the interests of children at the heart of Government and to build on the successes already achieved in the context of the national children&rsquo;s strategy. The responsibilities of the new office within the Department of Health and Children will comprise the following functions: the equal opportunities child care programme, transferred from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the programmes and <Col N="312"/>activities of the National Children&rsquo;s Office; and policy and legislative work on child welfare and protection, transferred from the Department of Health and Children. The new youth justice service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the early years education functions of the Department of Education and Science will also be located in the new office.</P>
        <P>The purpose in bringing the various responsibilities together is to maximise the co-ordination of policies for children and young people and to provide a strong focus at the highest level. As Minister for Children with delegated responsibilities in the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I will attend meetings of the Government on a regular basis. This will give a strong voice for the interests of children and young people at Cabinet.</P>
        <P>One of the key strengths of the National Children&rsquo;s Office has been its cross-cutting functions which allowed it to work with other agencies in an innovative way. The new structure will allow this work to be continued with a renewed focus in the context of a more comprehensive strategic framework and simpler administrative arrangements.</P>
        <P>Ms Sylda Langford has been appointed director general of the office of the Minister for Children within the Department of Health and Children. As the office is within the Department of Health and Children, the Secretary General of that Department will be responsible for the office. The youth justice service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the early years education functions of the Department of Education and Science will remain the responsibility of the Secretaries General of these Departments respectively.</P>
        <P>Work is under way to identify a suitable location for the office. As the office is part of the Department of Health and Children, it will have full logistical support of the corporate services, personnel and finance sections of the Department. Strategic decisions will be finalised when the basic organisational structure is in place. The office will be included in any revised statement of strategy for the Department of Health and Children. With regard to the funding of the office, the resources concerned are the subject of discussions with the Department of Finance and will be announced on the publication of the revised Estimates.</P>

	<P>The maternity and infant care scheme provides an agreed programme of care, free of charge, to an expectant mother arising out of her pregnancy and to her new born baby for six weeks after birth. All expectant mothers, irrespective of being medical card holders or not, who are ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible to avail of services under the scheme. Women who choose to avail of these services are under the care of both a general practitioner of their choice and a hospital obstetrician. Care can be obtained from any general practitioner who has a contract for the provision of services under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides for 12 ante-natal visits, six to the general practitioner and six to the chosen maternity unit or hospital in the case of a first pregnancy. In subsequent pregnancies, there are seven visits to the general practitioner and five to the maternity unit or hospital. There are also two post-natal visits to the general practitioner, at two weeks for the baby and at six weeks for mother and baby. There has been no change to the number of visits provided for under the scheme, whether ante-natal or post-natal.</P>

        <Quest> further to the Budget Statement of 8 December 2005 in respect of the development of the nursing home subvention scheme, when the new arrangements will come into force; the value of property and cash to be taken into account in considering applications for subvention within the Dublin area and outside of the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1683/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 on foot of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993, which were made under section 7 of the Nursing Homes Act 1990. These regulations laid down the criteria for assessing a person&rsquo;s eligibility for subvention as well as the maximum <Col N="315"/>amounts of subvention that may be paid to an eligible person.</P>
        <P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are three rates of subvention payable, &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50, respectively, for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. Included in these payments is an increase of 25% which came into effect in April 2001. These rates remain in effect and were not changed on budget day.</P>
        <P>The HSE may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention subject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. Additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the scheme for 2006, bringing the total available budget to &euro;160 million.</P>
        <P>Certain thresholds were set in the 1993 regulations with regard to the means and assets of a person applying for a subvention. These thresholds had not been updated since they were set in 1993. Amendment regulations, the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 2005, amended the thresholds contained in the 1993 regulations by increasing the threshold of assets to be disregarded for the purposes of subvention assessment from &pound;6,000, &euro;7,618, to &euro;11,000, increasing the asset threshold above which subvention may be refused from &pound;20,000, &euro;25,394, to &euro;36,000 and increasing the threshold of principal residence value above which subvention may be refused from &pound;75,000, &euro;95,230, to &euro;500,000 or more where the residence is located in the Dublin area or &euro;300,000 or more where the residence is located outside the Dublin area, provided that the applicant&rsquo;s income is greater than &euro;9,000. This income threshold was previously &pound;5,000 or &euro;6,349.</P>
        <P>The HSE continues to retain the discretion to impute an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or son or daughter aged less than 21 years, in full-time education or in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old-age non-contributory pension, and generally does so unless there are exceptional circumstances. However, the residence value above which it may automatically refuse to pay a subvention has been increased substantially, as outlined, to take account of increased property values.</P>
        <P>These amendment regulations were signed by the T&aacute;naiste on 14 December 2005 and came into <Col N="316"/>law on that date. Under section 14 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, once the regulations are made, they must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, either of which can pass a resolution to annul the regulations within the following 21 days on which the House sits.</P>
        <P>Following on the publication of the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs was established. The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme conducted by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. The report of the group has been submitted to Government.</P>

	<P>Casemix is an internationally accepted evidence-based management system used for the monitoring and evaluation of health services. It allows for the collection, categorisation and interpretation of hospital patient data related to the types of cases treated to assist hospitals in defining their products, measuring their productivity and assessing their quality. Casemix is used for many purposes related to hospital and health service management as it provides the only audited national dataset of patient related information necessary for national planning. With regard to using casemix as part of the budgetary process, this is done so that hospitals are fully funded for the patients they actually treat at a cost per case set by their peers.</P>
        <P>The system reviews each patient treated, having regard to their age, sex, diagnoses, procedures, length of stay, mode of discharge, etc. and calculates a cost per case for each patient generated by their peers. The programme allows each hospital to take full account of their unique patients and unique issues. The entire process takes place in consultation with each hospital placing patient-centred information at the heart of the process.</P>
        <P>The casemix allocations recently released are a result of a review of 2004 activity and costs in 37 hospitals nationally. Some 30% of the budget for inpatients and day cases was peer group performance related, an increase of 20% on the previous year. This is set to increase to 40% next year and 50% the following year. A small adjustment, 2.5%, with regard to accident and emergency cases was also included.</P>
        <P>I am committed to performance related targets and casemix is the most internationally accepted performance related acute hospital activity programme. It has been agreed between my Department and the Health Service Executive that casemix will be used as a central pillar in all acute hospital funding policy.</P>

	<P>The charging for long-stay care under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 is being implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005. These regulations, which were signed on 14 June 2005, reinstated charges for inpatient services and provided for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. The regulations were prepared following extensive consultation with the HSE and others.</P>
        <P>Section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the levying of a charge where inpatient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months. In this regard, charging of patients in long-term care commenced on 14 July 2005, which was after the expiration of 30 days after the regulations were signed.</P>
        <P>The regulations, in keeping with section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied. Class one refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser. Class two refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24-hour basis. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of undue hardship. Under section 1(b) of the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, the HSE can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure on themselves or their dependants, if any. The management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004. It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to a specific case that involves the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy on this case.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410 and 419 together.</P>
        <P>The vitamin B12 products concerned, cytamen and neo-cytamen, were removed from the common list of reimbursable drugs and medicines when the manufacturer advised my Department that, because of problems in the manufacturing process, they had become temporarily unavailable both in Ireland and the UK. The manufacturer has informed my Department that the problems with one of the products, cytamen, have now been resolved and it will now be restored to the common list. Neo-cytamen is still unavailable.</P>
        <P>An alternative product, cobalin H, is available in community pharmacies for people who have been prescribed the original product. Cobalin H is reimbursable under the drug payment scheme. It is a matter for the relevant area of the Health Service Executive to make arrangements for its reimbursement when prescribed for and dispensed to medical cardholders.</P>

	<P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for orthodontic services. I have asked the HSE to issue a direct reply to the Deputy regarding when a decision will be made <Col N="323"/>on the provision of orthodontic treatment to the individual concerned.</P>
        <P>The aim of my Department is to develop the treatment capacity of orthodontics in a sustainable way over the longer term and the Department is continuing to work with the Health Service Executive to achieve this aim. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need, as happens under the existing guidelines. These guidelines were issued in 1985 and are intended to enable the HSE to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the HSE that at the end of the September 2005 quarter, there were 23,688 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means more than twice as many patients are getting orthodontic treatment as are waiting to be treated and more than 7,000 extra patients are getting treatment from the HSE when compared with the September 2001 quarter. The improvement in quality of treatment and numbers being treated is directly attributable to the steps that have already been taken and will continue to be taken to ensure ongoing improvements to the service. The addition of 13 specialists in orthodontics to the service since 1 October 2005 will have a further significant impact on numbers in treatment and waiting lists.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that only those employees who were employed after 6 April 1995 make contributions to the main superannuation fund. The contribution rate is 3.5% net. In addition, these employees make further contributions of 1.5% gross in respect of future lump sum payments at retirement and 1.5% gross in respect of the spouses and children element of the fund.</P>
        <P>Almost all of the remaining employees make contributions of 1.5% gross in respect of spouses and children. The money collected by my Department by way of all superannuation contributions by employees and paid over to the Department of Finance is as follows: in 2003, &euro;650,000; in 2004, &euro;703,000; and in 2005, &euro;810,000. In addition, employee and employer PRSI contributions are paid over to the Revenue Commissioners who make the relevant payments to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the social insurance fund.</P>

	<P>Casemix is an internationally accepted evidence-based management system used for the monitoring and evaluation of health services. It allows for the collection, categorisation and interpretation of hospital patient data related to the types of cases treated to assist hospitals define their products, measure their productivity and assess quality. Casemix is used for many purposes related to hospital and health service management as it provides the only audited national data set of patient related information necessary for national planning. With regard to using casemix as part of the budgetary process, this is done so that hospitals are fully funded for the patients they actually treat at a cost per case set by their own peers.</P>
        <P>The system reviews each patient treated, having regard to age, sex, diagnoses, procedures, length of stay, mode of discharge, etc. and calculates a cost per case for each patient both in the individual hospital and nationally within the hospital&rsquo;s peer group. The programme allows each hospital to take full account of their unique patients and unique issues. The entire process takes place in consultation with each hospital, placing patient centred information at the heart of the process.</P>
        <P>Details of the adjustments for James Connolly Memorial Hospital from 1998 to date are: in 1998, &euro;33,086; in 1999, &euro;76,185; in 2000, &euro;214,654; in 2001, &euro;92,631; in 2002, &euro;84,576; in 2003, &euro;331,370; in 2004, &euro;1,079,638; and in 2005, &euro;1,339,389. The negative adjustments are a reflection of the hospital&rsquo;s true performance <i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i> its peers following full compensation for its own unique local circumstances and mix of cases. This year, the negative adjustment fell considerably from &euro;1,330,389 to &euro;711,432 and it is hoped this trend will continue.</P>
        <P>The casemix budget model now comprises four separate elements: inpatients; day cases; split-year workload; and, since last year, accident and emergency. Data on inpatients day cases and accident and emergency are for the calendar year under review and the budgetary figures recently released relate to 2004 activity and costs. The split-year workload adjustment reviews inpatient activity from July 2004 to end-June 2005 and is used to focus on the most up-to-date data available and draw hospital management&rsquo;s attention to trends. This year, the hospital actually gained some funding under this portion of the budget. If this trend has been continued throughout 2005, the hospital may have addressed key issues and is <Col N="326"/>moving towards a positive budgetary outcome in the future.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s policy regarding the issue of bullying is the implementation of the revised anti-harassment, sexual harassment and bullying policy for the Civil Service, A Positive Working Environment, which came into effect on 1 September 2005. The summary leaflet on this policy has been circulated to all staff and the main report is available on request. Earlier this month, a two-day course was provided to train eight members of staff to act as contact persons, as defined in the revised policy, and a further two-day course will be run in early February for bullying and harassment investigator training. There are no outstanding law cases regarding the issue within my Department and, since 2001, there has been one case which was resolved at the investigation stage.</P>
        <P>The revised policy is designed to ensure compliance with the codes of practice issued under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 and the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004. Given that existing legislation covering bullying and harassment is more than adequate, I see no purpose in bringing forward more legislation in this area.</P>

	<P>My Department makes payments under a number of schemes. Civil service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up <Col N="327"/>to 20% can be made to individuals. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee and available on the website <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals because that is regarded as personal information.</P><Col N="328"/>
        <P>The purpose of the INPUT scheme is to facilitate and encourage the submission of suggestions by eligible civil servants aimed at improving civil service operations. All grades up to and including principal officer and their equivalents are eligible to submit suggestions.

	<P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to be delivered on its behalf health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the administration of influenza vaccine. The HSE has confirmed that it was agreed last October, as an urgent public health measure, that all poultry workers should be <Col N="330"/>actively offered the seasonal influenza vaccine. The purpose of this was to prevent the possibility of an individual being infected by both avian and human influenza at the same time and hence giving rise to a mutation of the avian influenza virus which could infect humans. The vaccination is free of charge to the relevant individuals.</P>
        <P>Those defined as poultry workers are poultry flock owners and their families; poultry veterinary practitioners; poultry advisers; Department of Agriculture and Food veterinary inspectors and other personnel involved in outbreak control measures; laboratory personnel involved in poultry post mortems or poultry virology; catching teams; poultry transporters; carcass transport and rendering plant personnel; workers in the hang-on, stunning and plucking areas in slaughter plants; fieldsmen; vaccinators and selectors; people involved in cleaning and disinfection of poultry houses or poultry transport; and personnel involved in litter removal and litter processing.</P>
        <P>The vaccination campaign for poultry workers has been implemented and vaccinations were available in all parts of the country. Owing to the high density of poultry farms in the north east and the mid-west, specific clinics were offered to the poultry industry for their employees to be vaccinated. A further effort at increasing uptake of the vaccine is about to be undertaken. The precise figure of those vaccinated is not available.</P>

        <P>The funding required to facilitate the development and roll-out of the advanced paramedic training programme has been provided in line with proposals set out by the Health Service Executive and pre-hospital emergency care council.</P>
        <P>The national ambulance training school, NATS, which operates under the auspices of the HSE in conjunction with University College Dublin, is providing training for advanced paramedic candidates on behalf of the pre-hospital <Col N="331"/>emergency care council.

	<P>I am committed to the national roll-out of the cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. An international expert examined the feasibility and implications of a national roll-out of a cervical screening programme and carried out an evaluation on the current pilot programme, quality assurance, laboratory capacity and the establishment of national governance arrangements. Following the publication of this report, my Department undertook a consultative process with relevant professional and advocacy stakeholders. The consultative process is completed and there is considerable support for the programme roll-out and the need for improved organisation, quality assurance and governance arrangements to provide for it nationally. I made available an additional &euro;9 million to the Health Service Executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for a national programme. The service plan of the executive provides for such preparation which, I understand, will involve improvements in quality assurance, new technology, training and the creation of a national population register.</P>

	<P>A consultancy study jointly com<Col N="332"/>missioned by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, DHSSPS, on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service, HEMS, for the island of Ireland was published last year and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The study concluded that the introduction of a dedicated inter-hospital air ambulance service would be appropriate in an all-island context.</P>
        <P>In considering the report, the DHSSPS advised that its priority at present is the need for further investment to improve the ground ambulance service. On foot of the report, my Department had detailed discussions with the Department of Defence regarding the future provision of air ambulance services by the Air Corps. Arising from these discussions, a detailed service level agreement has been prepared and signed. The signatories to the agreement are the Department of Defence, the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, the Defence Forces and the Air Corps. The agreement sets out the range of services to be provided by the Air Corps, specifically, inter-hospital transfer for spinal and serious injury and illness; air transport of neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland; air transport of patients requiring emergency organ transplant in the UK; air transport of organ harvest teams within Ireland; air transport of patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals where the coastguard service is not available.</P>
        <P>A steering group comprising representation from each the signatories to the service level agreement has been established. The group will monitor the operation of the agreement and will amend, if necessary, the provisions of the agreement to take account of service developments, including the new fleet replacement programme being put in place by the Air Corps. The Irish Coast Guard will continue to provide services on the same basis as heretofore.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 458 together.</P>
        <P>The report of the national task force on medical staffing, the Hanly report, made a series of important recommendations about the development of hospital services. These covered issues such as the changes needed in non-consultant hospital doctors&rsquo; work patterns, reform of medical education and training, the need for a significantly revised contract for medical consultants and an increase in the number of consultants and the reorganisation of acute hospital services. My Department is working closely with the HSE to build on, and progress, these recommendations. Negotiations on a new contract for consultants have begun. It is important that a new contract be put in place as soon as possible. I also want the discussions which have been under way for some time now about the work patterns of NCHDs to be brought to a successful conclusion at an early date. I am considering a report from <Col N="335"/>the medical education and training group on postgraduate medical education and training. I hope to bring proposals in this regard to the Government soon in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, who is considering the recommendations of the Fottrel report.</P>
        <P>These measures, combined with ongoing investment in acute hospital facilities, extra consultant posts and the organisation of services around hospital networks, are designed to provide patients with faster access to high-quality consultant-provided services.</P>

        <P>Furthermore, on 7 December 2005 my office met the social services inspectorate and the HSE to discuss the issue of accommodation standards for unaccompanied minors. It was agreed at that meeting that the standards for children in residential care will apply to accommodation for unaccompanied minors aged 16 and under. The same standards will apply, subject to guidance notes which are being drafted by the SSI in consultation with the HSE, to accommodation for those aged 17 to 18.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive deals with initial inquiries on adoption under its child care programmes. It can provide information to prospective applicants, issue application forms and ensure that all the necessary documentation has been collated.</P>
        <P>When a prospective adopter contacts his or her local HSE office with an initial inquiry, his or her will be sent an information pack which will help him or her to start the process of self-reflection. Some HSE areas and adoption agencies invite those interested in adopting to an information <Col N="337"/>evening to distribute this documentation, using it as an opportunity for adopters to meet with other interested adopters as well as a member of their adoption team. Information and advice on both domestic and intercountry adoption are also available from the Adoption Board, including information booklets on the adoption process.</P>

	<P>The current position in relation to the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS) is that no more than 12 payments should be made by a family or individual in a full year on medication for use in any calendar month. The Health Service Executive primary care reimbursement service, formerly the GMS (payments) board, which is responsible for reimbursing community pharmacists under the DPS, advised all community pharmacists in 1999 on the establishment of the DPS that no more than 12 payments should be made in a year. However, once in a 12-month period or periodically, more than a 28 day supply may be provided, depending on the drugs and medicines, to ensure that no more than 12 payments are made in a year by an individual or a family. I have no plans to amend the terms of the DPS to introduce an additional threshold period, as proposed by the Deputy</P>

	<P Just="Left">An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, the Registrar General, is the person with statutory responsibility for the administration of the civil registration system in Ireland, including civil mar<Col N="340"/>riages. I have made enquiries with an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir and the position is as follows.</P>
        <P>The Civil Registration Act, 2004 provides for the commencement of the various provisions of the Act on a gradual basis. Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Act, which relate to the administration of the service and the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths, were commenced on 5 December 2005. The new provisions for marriage are set out in Part 6 of the 2004 Act and include universal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages, as well as a choice of venue for civil marriage ceremonies. Before the provisions can be commenced, a substantial body of work needs to be completed, including drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; establishment of a register of approved venues for civil marriages; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage provisions introduced in the Act.</P>
        <P>An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir is unable to give a specific date for the implementation of the new marriage procedures but it is unlikely to be before October 2006. It is intended to give as much public notice as possible and a comprehensive public information campaign will be undertaken at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the fact that some of the existing offices of registrars of civil marriages are less than ideal when it comes to facilitating large gatherings. I am also conscious of the considerable and continuing increase in demand for civil marriage ceremonies. Both of these factors were taken into consideration in enacting the new marriage provisions and I am confident that these provisions, once commenced, will lead to significant enhancement of the services provided in this area of civil registration.</P>

	<P>Prior to the establishment of the Health Service Executive, parliamentary questions concerning access to services by individuals or in specific geographic areas were referred to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board for direct reply. Pursuant to the Health Act 2004, the functions of the health boards were transferred to the HSE. The HSE has established <Col N="342"/>a parliamentary affairs division, PAD, which provides a central contact for all Oireachtas requests for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the executive. I have recently issued an information note to Members of the Oireachtas outlining the arrangements in place within the HSE to deal with information requests, including matters raised in parliamentary questions.</P>
        <P>The PAD aims to provide replies within 20 working days from the date of a parliamentary question. It will issue interim replies in cases where it is not in a position to provide the information within 20 working days. It is committed to reducing this period as the HSE develops its organisational and information capacity and it will make every effort to provide more immediate responses in instances where the information sought is of a routine nature or is readily available.</P>
        <P>Section 79 of the Health Act 2004 provides for the Health Service Executive to conduct its dealings with members of either House of the Oireachtas in accordance with regulations. The Health Act 2004 (Dealings with Members of either House of the Oireachtas) Regulations 2005, SI No. 798 of 2005, were made on 12 December 2005 and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 14 December 2005. These regulations give specific directions to the HSE with regard to its dealings with Members of the Oireachtas. I do not intend to amend the current regulations or make new regulations at this point in time.</P>

	<P>The voluntary sector providers have an important role to play in the provision of pre-hospital care. I see this role continuing through the development, for example, of first responder schemes in the community, working in association with the statutory service. As part of the reform of the health service a national ambulance office has been established under the auspices of the national hospitals office within the HSE. The office has responsibility for the provision of pre-hospital emergency care nationally and works in conjunction with the pre-hospital emergency care council, PHECC, as the body with statutory responsibility for the development of standards in pre-hospital emergency care. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to co-ordinate the preparation of a more detailed reply to the Deputy on this matter.</P>

	<P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Persons aged 70 years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means. Medical card holders are eligible for the following services: general practitioner services provided under the general medical service scheme; approved prescribed drugs and medicines; inpatient public hospital services in public wards, including consultant services; outpatient public <Col N="350"/>hospital services including consultant services; dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances; and maternity and infant care scheme.</P>
        <P>All other health and personal social services, including home help assistance, can be provided by the Health Service Executive subject to the availability of resources, and having regard to the needs of individual cases. The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused. An additional &euro;33 million was allocated for the home help service in the 2006 budget, &euro;30 million in 2006 and a further &euro;3 million in 2007. This additional funding will provide 1.75 million more home help hours.</P>

However, a number of issues of significance have arisen recently which have a bearing on both the scope and cost of the project, and which need to be clarified before the review can be undertaken.</P>
        <P>First, the executive has had to review the design of the project to take account of the recently completed SARI, strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, guidelines relating to infection control. These have implications for the design of ward accommodation in the case of capital developments. As a consequence, it has been necessary for the HSE to redesign some elements of the Mullingar project. In addition, the national hospitals office, NHO, within the executive was asked by my Department to indicate whether the revenue cost estimate, prepared by the HSE midland area, has been endorsed by the NHO, taking account of the matters described above. The need for further review of the revenue cost for this project will be considered on foot of a response which is awaited from the NHO to these issues.</P>

	<P>Following the publication of the Abridged Estimates Volume 2006, I wrote to the chairman of the HSE outlining the details of the Estimates and the key policies and objectives that I wanted the HSE to pursue. In accordance with the Health Act 2004 the HSE has to submit a service plan to me and this plan has to be accompanied by an estimate of income and expenditure relating to the plan and that estimate must be consistent with the Estimate as published and budget day additions. In my letter to the HSE I also reiterated the requirement for strict compliance with Government policy on controlling the numbers employed in the health service and <Col N="352"/>the absolute necessity of putting in place a robust system for the effective management of employment levels in both the HSE and the wider public health service. Monitoring of the service plan will take place on a continuous basis throughout 2006.</P>

        <P>While the office of the ombudsman for children is a public body under the Freedom of Information Act, the Act does not apply to records relating to an examination or investigation carried out by that body.

        <P>The childminding relief I introduced in budget 2006 allows an individual to mind up to three children in the minder&rsquo;s own home without paying tax, PRSI or levies on the childminding earnings received, provided the amount is not more than &euro;10,000 per annum. If childminding income exceeds &euro;10,000, the total amount will be taxable, as normal, under self-assessment.</P>
        <P>The new scheme is not a tax allowance, but is in fact an income disregard of &euro;10,000. It automatically follows that the amount earned, once it does not exceed &euro;10,000, is not assessable to tax or PRSI or levies and is thus exempt from tax, PRSI and levies. Any change to make the income subject to PRSI, either on a voluntary or mandatory basis, would require an amendment to the relevant social welfare legislation which would be a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to consider in the first instance.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has introduced legislation to allow certain civil servants work beyond the existing retirement age if they choose to do so. The Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 introduced a number of important changes in relation to the retirement age of civil servants. These changes mean that there is no longer a compulsory retirement age of 65 for &ldquo;new entrants&rdquo; who joined the Civil Service on or after 1 April 2004. The changes also raised the minimum pension age to 65 years for most &ldquo;new entrants&rdquo; to the Civil Service, with the exception of &ldquo;new entrants&rdquo; to the Prison Service, where different arrangements apply for operational reasons.</P>
        <P>The removal of a compulsory retirement age as outlined above means that, over the medium to longer term, as more and more new staff are recruited as &ldquo;new entrants&rdquo; for the purposes of the new legislation, an increasing number of civil servants will have the right to work beyond the age of 65 if they choose to do so. Clearly, in time, all civil servants will be working under these terms and conditions. The legislative changes introduced also provide a mechanism by which existing civil servants can work beyond the retirement age if they wish. While a person who joined <Col N="358"/>the public service before 1 April 2004 must retire at 65, they can be reappointed to the Civil Service as a &ldquo;new entrant&rdquo;, provided there is a break in their service of 26 weeks.</P>
        <P>At the moment there are no immediate proposals to change the current situation whereby staff recruited before 1 April 2004 must retire at 65 and those recruited on or after that date have no mandatory retirement age. However, we will keep this position under review.</P>

	<P>In January 1993, following a protracted period of illness by the person referred to in the question, the chief <Col N="359"/>medical officer, CMO, sought an independent expert opinion. To facilitate this process, my Department prepared a career history setting out the key developments in the career of the person in question between 10 November 1975 and 21 January 1993.</P>
        <P>This document was sent to the CMO who in turn forwarded it to the expert consultant psychiatrist. A copy was also provided to the legal representative of the person. The career history did not include any reference to medical advice by the CMO in February 1988.</P>
        <P>The person named disputed aspects of the career history in correspondence directly with the consultant psychiatrist and copied this to my Department. I understand that the person named declined to attend the appointment with the consultant psychiatrist.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where a principal contractor engages a subcontractor and that subcontractor holds a C2 or a certificate of authorisation issued by Revenue, the principal contractor can apply to the tax office for a relevant payments card for that subcontractor. The payments card authorises the principal to make payments to that subcontractor without deduction of relevant contract tax and applies to all payments made up to the end of the year that the payments card is valid for. The principal contractor must satisfy himself that the photograph and signature of the C2 holder are in order. Until the payments card for the subcontractor is received from Revenue a principal contractor must deduct RCT from all payments made to a subcontractor.</P>
        <P>In processing the application for a payments card, the Revenue Commissioners carry out certain checks to satisfy themselves that the subcontractor is meeting his requirements in relation to his tax obligations before the payments card issues. The payments cards are issued centrally from Revenue&rsquo;s computer systems. Each card is assigned a security number and the date of issue of the card and the principal and subcontractor details are recorded in Revenue&rsquo;s systems. During the year ended 31 December 2004, 41,630 C2s and 245,173 payment cards were issued. Where a contract is still ongoing at the end of a year, and the principal holds a payment card for a subcontractor for the current year, they may apply for a payments card for the coming year, where they have received details of the subcontractors C2 for the coming year.</P>
        <P>Where the Revenue Commissioners cancel a C2, all principal contractors that have been issued with a payments card are notified and instructed to deduct RCT from all payments made to the subcontractor after the date of the notice and to return to the Revenue Commissioners any relevant payments cards they hold for the subcontractor.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to marked gas oil, MGO, more commonly known as green diesel. MGO is a very different product from kerosene, for example, MGO is used in particular, in agricultural tractors, dumpers and mobile cranes. There is also the problem that it can be used illegally, for example, in motor vehicles and trucks. The Revenue Commissioners have a constant fight on their hands to stamp out this activity. Of course, MGO can be used for other non-auto use such as heating but I did not reduce the MGO excise rate for heating because, first, to do so would require putting in place a differentiated rate for MGO depending on its usage which is not possible on a practical level. Second, my initial move in this <Col N="362"/>budget to halve rates, and to introduce a zero rate from next year&rsquo;s budget, for Kerosene and LPG would not be allowable for MGO under the EU energy tax directive. Third, kerosene is regarded as a much cleaner fuel than MGO, with the latter having a much higher sulphur content. Finally, I reduced tax on kerosene to help the excise related price gap between here and Northern Ireland &mdash; this issue does not arise in the case of MGO.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The above figures are provisional.</P>
        <P>The customs service made a total of 1,223 drug seizures in 2005 amounting to 4,504 kgs. The number of seizures include those relating to ecstasy and LSD although they are not recorded by weight. Seizures ranged from small personal &ldquo;own-use&rdquo; amounts of herbal cannabis or cannabis resin to large consignments which were imported by organised crime groups. Given the number of seizures, many of which were small quantities, it would be onerous to list each individually with its value. The table shows the total quantity and value for each drug category.</P>
        <P>The quantities of drugs seized represent a significant increase in the volumes of cannabis resin, ecstasy or MDMA, cocaine and LSD seized compared with 2004 seizures. This reflects the commitment of the Revenue Commissioners to delivering on the supply reduction targets set for law enforcement in the Government&rsquo;s national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>A significant feature of customs operations in 2005 was the quality of supply detection seizures <Col N="362"/>emanating from joint operations and joint investigations. This can be attributed to the enhanced level of national and international intelligence sharing, targeting and joint operations focused at organized crime groups by customs, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and international law enforcement agencies.</P>

        <P>A special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, <Col N="364"/>with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme. The group&rsquo;s report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, which included the qualifying disability criteria, I should state that given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The best way of addressing the transport needs of people with disabilities, including the effectiveness, suitability or otherwise of the disabled drivers scheme in that regard, will be progressed in consultation with the other Departments which have responsibility in this area. A car tax concession scheme can obviously only play a partial role in dealing with this serious issue.</P>

        <Quest>the reason members of the public have not been able to contact the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Border-midland-western office by telephone since the announcement of the budget 2006; the steps which are being taken to address this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1093/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in the period since the budget announcement, the Revenue Commissioners in the Border-midlands-west, BMW, region have dealt with significant numbers of telephone enquiries, both on the lo-call 1890 number for PAYE customers and on the general telephone lines for other customers.</P>
        <P>Since 5 December 2005, the operation of the 1890 service has been restricted to the hours of 9.15 a.m. to 1p.m., but with additional numbers of staff being provided to deal with phone queries during these hours. Throughout 2005, Revenue experienced significant increases in business volume, particularly in the PAYE area, and the 1890 service has been restricted to these hours to enable PAYE staff to address a substantial backlog of correspondence that had built up during October and November.</P>
        <P>This temporary restriction in the hours of operation of the 1890 telephone service has not significantly reduced the number of taxpayer telephone queries being dealt with on a daily basis in the BMW region. For example, during November 2005, before the temporary restriction of hours was introduced, an average of 964 calls per day were dealt with. However, because an increased number of operators are assigned to the system during the restricted hours of operation, an average of 959 taxpayer queries per day are being dealt with on the 1890 service at present. In addition, the BMW region handles an average of approximately 1,700 customer queries per day on its other telephone lines. I am informed by Revenue that it is their intention to revert to an unrestricted service as soon as circumstances allow.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that a number of self service options &mdash; via touch-tone telephone, text message or internet &mdash; have been introduced, allowing customers to automatically request forms and leaflets and to claim certain amendments to their tax credit certificate without the need to talk to a staff member. A much wider range of on-line facilities, allowing PAYE taxpayers to file returns and make rebate claims and to update their tax credits and reliefs, will be provided over the coming months.</P>

	<P>EU Directive 2005/19/EC contains amendments to the Directive 90/434/EEC on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member States. The purpose of that directive is to provide that such transactions can be carried out on a tax neutral basis while protecting the interests of the member states.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Directive 2005/19/EC amends the 1990 directive in a number of ways. One aspect concerns the formation of two new types of EU entity. The entities concerned are European companies, or SEs, and European Co-operative <Col N="367"/>Societies, or SCEs. The 2005 directive adds these entities to the list of companies covered by the 1990 directive. In addition, when an SE or an SCE changes its registered office from one member state to another, the 2005 directive provides that it should be able to do so on a tax neutral basis. The aspects of the 2005 directive concerning SEs and SCEs are required to be transposed into law by 1 January 2006 while the balance of the provisions have to be transposed by 1 January 2007. It is proposed that all of the issues be implemented with effect from 1 January 2006 by way of provisions in the 2006 Finance Bill.</P>

	<P>My Department is not aware of any practice by financial institutions with regard to the calculation of interest charges on mortgage loans, other than those already investigated by the financial regulator, that has given rise to instances of over-charging of customers.</P>
        <P>However, where a borrower has a concern with regard to the calculation of interest or other matters relating to a mortgage loan or would like to make a complaint, he or she should contact the institution involved and explain the problem.

The telephone No. is 1890 88 20 90 or (01) 662 0890, <i>www.financialombudsman.ie</i>. Additionally, the financial regulator has issued an independent consumer guide to mortgages and also provides information to consumers through its helpline, available on 1890 77 77 77. If the Deputy has any specific information in relation to this issue, it should be made available to the financial regulator for further investigation.</P>

	<P>I have no plans to introduce stamp duty relief for full-time farmers over 35 years of age on the transfer of a farm from a family member. As the Deputy will be aware, the stamp duty code contains full stamp duty relief for transfers of land to young trained farmers, that is, under 35 years, where land is transferred to them by way of gift or sale, provided they have attained relevant educational qualifications. This relief, which is considered generous, is intended to encourage the transfer of land to young farmers who have successfully undergone training.</P>
        <P>In addition, where a parent wishes to transfer agricultural land to a child where the child does not qualify for this young trained farmer relief, he or she can qualify for a 50% relief on the stamp duty otherwise chargeable, as the child of the person transferring the land.</P>

As the timber extension was a temporary measure, the extension and timber baffles have been recovered and may be reused elsewhere. The cost of permanent works, summer 2005: the work to fit a concrete extension to the Denil fish pass and the installation of a second fish pass during summer 2005 were carried out as a single operation.

	<P>As a result of a detailed consultation process between the local authorities and representatives of the various local water safety and water based sporting groups, all the appropriate provisions for safety deemed necessary are included in the finished scheme. A safety audit carried out by Irish Water Safety identified the alteration of Lacken Weir as creating a hazard for canoeists who may not be experienced in dealing with fast, white water and noted that the alteration includes the incorporation of a fish pass structure. The audit recommended that the appropriate authority should write to the Irish Canoe Union advising them of the changes to the weir. The OPW will do this now, and again upon completion of works at the weir.</P>
        <P>As a additional safety feature, I have asked OPW to erect a sign warning of the presence of the fish pass, as soon as feasible. As a requirement for a canoe pass was not identified during the consultation process with the water based sporting groups, there are no plans to construct one.</P>

	<P>The playing field in question is located at the Waterbarracks area of Kilkenny, adjacent to the River Breagagh upstream of Blackcat bridge. The playing field is owned by the local authority. The purpose of the River Nore &mdash; Kilkenny City &mdash; drainage scheme is to protect homes and business affected by flooding. The scheme sought to maintain natural floodplains where possible. The natural floodplains retained are those where the impact on homes and businesses is at a minimum. The playing fields at the Waterbarracks is one such area. This area has always been susceptible to flooding and will continue to flood during high river flows, when it acts as a flood plain. The retention of this area as a flood plain was a part of the exhibited flood relief scheme and was fully approved by the local authority. There are no plans in place to raise the level of this area of flood plain.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the &ldquo;dirt grid&rdquo; or &ldquo;trash rack&rdquo; referred to by the Deputy is to trap flood debris upstream of the residential/commercial areas provided with flood protection by the drainage scheme. The trash rack is inspected and cleaned regularly by OPW staff. There is no arrangement in place with the local authority in respect of cleaning the rack as they have informed OPW that they do not have the resources to assist in this matter. As the trash rack is trapping debris other than flood debris, such as domestic rubbish, plastic bottles etc., it is planned to widen the width between the grids of the rack. In this way, the trash rack will continue to fulfil its function of trapping flood debris, but will allow most other debris to pass through it. This will maximise the efficiency of the rack and minimise any risk of accumulated debris causing flooding without an increase in floodwaters. The playing field area will continue to act as a flood plain when there is an increase in floodwaters. My officials will raise the possibility of cleaning the trash rack again with the local authority before carrying out the proposed alterations. I will arrange for officials from my office to meet with members of St. Anthony&rsquo;s Soccer Club.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The end December Exchequer returns indicated that, on an Exchequer issues basis, spending in 2005 totalled &euro;35.467 million or &euro;2.920 million more than 2004, an increase of 9%. This was some &euro;705 million less than provided in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, 2005 and comprised &euro;564 million current and &euro;141 million capital, excluding capital carryover then estimated at &euro;345.7 million and which is available for spending in 2006 subject to the terms of an order to be made under section 91 of the Finance Act 2004. These are preliminary outturn figures and an updated provisional outturn will be published in the Revised Estimates Volume 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department was advised late on Tuesday evening, 17 January 2006 by the Department of Health and Children that the Health Service Executive had advised it on that day that there may be some alterations to its estimated outturn and consequently its capital carryover figure of &euro;56.4 million included in the Appropriation Act 2005. The Act provided that, in respect of the HSE, a sum of &euro;56.4 million could be made available for spending in 2006 in respect of capital not disbursed in 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the Department of Health and Children that, on the basis of the preliminary outturn figures for 2005 from the HSE, the capital savings anticipated by the HSE in December may have been used to meet similar sized costs under the current expenditure heading. The Department of Health and Children is awaiting final verification of the outturn from the HSE. The implications of this development for the 2006 capital budget for the HSE will be reviewed in the context of the 2006 Revised Estimates Volume. I am determined to ensure that it will not have an adverse impact on the plans for the HSE&rsquo;s capital spending in 2006. As matters stand, the 2006 capital allocation for the HSE is &euro;558 million, an increase of 10% on the provisional 2005 outturn.</P>
        <P>The legal instrument that gives effect to the carrying over of funds from 2005 to 2006 and determines the actual amounts to be carried forward is a ministerial order. Under the relevant legislation &mdash; section 91 of the Finance Act 2004 &mdash; the order must be made before the end of March and the draft order will be put formally before the House for approval by resolution. The Revised Estimates Volume will also include details of the carryover under each Vote and I will accordingly advise the House in due course in compliance with the legal requirements.</P>
        <P>The overall savings of some &euro;705 million referred to earlier occurred across almost all Votes and the preliminary explanations from Departments indicate that savings on current issues were attributable to a combination of factors primarily higher than expected appropriations-in-aid, a reduction on the forecast live register levels and lower than expected demand <Col N="380"/>on certain demand led schemes. The reasons for the capital underspend are primarily timing delays in relation to certain projects, lower demand for some demand led schemes and buoyancy in own source income of certain State bodies.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these savings, overall spending in 2005 based on the Exchequer returns increased by about 9% over 2004. I have also made provision in my recent budget for further substantial increases in spending in 2006. Within the overall increase in gross voted spending of 11% announced on budget day, I have allocated very significant increases in expenditure particularly for the priority areas of health, education and social welfare. This includes a social welfare budget day package of approximately &euro;1.1 billion and a five year child care programme costing over &euro;300 million in the first year and with a cumulative cost of &euro;2.65 billion.</P>

	<P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that the process for Ireland joining the Asian Development Bank, ADB, is already at an advanced stage. Our primary objective in joining the ADB is to assist in economic development of Asia. The Deputy will be aware that the Development Banks Act 2005, which was only enacted on 21 December 2005, provides for Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Asian Development Bank. Until then there was no authority to make any application. The next formal step was for a formal letter of application to be addressed to the bank&rsquo;s president. This was done on 19 January 2006 following informal contact with the bank in the period since the legislation was enacted.</P>
        <P>Although officials in my Department have already negotiated the broad terms for membership, the articles of agreement require that Ireland&rsquo;s application must be considered by the banks board to see if Ireland fully meets the required criteria for membership. It is then notified to all existing members and must be approved by vote of those members. This may take some time as existing members are allowed time to consider the application for membership. Ireland&rsquo;s application for membership is now with the bank and there are no steps open to me. <Col N="381"/>However, I hope the process will be completed before the bank&rsquo;s AGM in May this year.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is disagreement between the Revenue Commissioners and the solicitor acting for the taxpayer in respect of the effect of the legal instrument drawn up in this case.</P>
        <P>Having examined the legal instrument, Revenue took the view that stamp duty was payable on the basis that the effect of the instrument was a transfer of an interest in land and advised the solicitor accordingly. Revenue also asked the solicitor at the time to provide details of the valuation of the lands mentioned in the instrument so that it could calculate the stamp duty payable. Details of valuation have not been provided to date and Revenue cannot calculate the liability in the absence of these details. However, the solicitor did not accept Revenue&rsquo;s view, maintaining instead that the instrument was exempt from stamp duty and asked that the matter be referred to the appeal commissioner for hearing.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in light of the technical and complex nature of the issues involved in this particular case, Revenue decided to seek its own legal advice before listing the matter for appeal and advised the solicitor on 30 August 2004 that it was making further inquiries and would revert back in due course. Regrettably, there has been a delay in getting the legal advice and I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they expect to receive their legal advice this week, at which time they will be in a position to advance this matter. I am also advised by Revenue that the taxpayer&rsquo;s <Col N="382"/>solicitor raised the matter again with them last week. In the circumstances, Revenue expect to write more fully to the solicitor this week on receipt of the legal advice.</P>

There were 358 contracts and a total of 107 reports were produced under them in the period in question. Of those reports containing recommendations, 38 have to date been implemented in full and 48 have been implemented in part. My Department spent &euro;2.982 million in 2005 and the estimates for such contracts included in the Abridged Estimates Volume for 2006 is &euro;7.376 million.</P>

All staff covered by the scheme have received training and the system has been functioning in my Department since its introduction.

        <P>In July 2004, the PMDS sub-committee of the General Council commenced negotiations to agree changes to the PMDS in light of the commitments in Sustaining Progress and the findings and recommendations of the Mercer evaluation of PMDS. The outcome of these negotiations was an integrated model outlined in General Council Report 1452, which was agreed and adopted 1 June 2005. The model, which integrates human resources policies and the PMDS process, will be used for training and familiarisation purposes from 1 January 2006 and will have full effect from 1 January 2007. Currently, management and staff, through the Departmental partnership committee, are in the process of agreeing the revision of various forms and a timetable for notification of the agreed changes to all staff and their supervisors.</P>

	<P>Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 exempts from income tax certain income from the leasing of farmland. Broadly speaking, if a farmer aged 40 years or over leases out farm land for a period of at least five years, some or all of the rent received for that land will be exempt from tax.</P>
        <P>From its inception in 1985, this legislation contained a provision &mdash; subsection (4) &mdash; that, where a lease relates to both farm land and other property, goods or services, only the income from the lease of the farmland qualifies for the tax relief. The exclusion of the single farm payment from the scope of the relief is not, therefore, a &ldquo;new Revenue practice&rdquo;. It is provided for in the law as it stands. In <i>Taxbriefing </i>issue 61 of November 2005, Revenue set out accordingly the taxation implications of the single farm payment scheme. A link to the full text of the <i>Taxbriefing </i>article is at <i>http://www.revenue.ie/publications/ txbrefng/tb61/frameset.htm</i>. However, as I announced in the budget, certain matters relating to the EU single farm payment entitlement will be contained in the Finance Bill 2006, which will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>The BMW regional assembly, as the managing authority of the BMW regional operational programme, carried out a review in early 2005 of the levels of project approvals and expenditure under the tourism measure. The review was carried out in consultation with my Department, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and F&aacute;ilte Ireland and followed concerns about the low level of expenditure by projects under the supported schemes. The managing authority&rsquo;s review confirmed earlier indications of poor levels of expenditure incurred by projects under the tourism measure and concluded that there was a real risk of loss of the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, commitment to this measure if action was not taken.</P>
        <P>Subsequent to the review, the BMW regional assembly sought the agreement of operational programme monitoring committee to reallocate <Col N="385"/>the ERDF commitment of &euro;4.36 million for the year 2005 from the tourism measure to the faster spending child care measure within the BMW operational programme. The action to reallocate the ERDF commitment was taken by the regional assembly in fulfilment of its obligations to avoid any possible loss of Structural Funds by the application of the automatic decommitment rules for Structural Funds set out in Regulation 1260/1999, the so-called N+2 rule. My Department, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and<?oasys _jy ?>the European Commission supported the<?oasys _jy ?>reallocation.</P>
        <P>I share the view of the BMW regional assembly that tourism plays an important role in the regional economy. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has indicated that he will make available Exchequer funds from the Vote of his Department to ensure that, notwithstanding the reallocation of the ERDF commitment, the same level of investment in the region&rsquo;s tourism product can be supported under the tourism measure over the lifetime of the regional operational programme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In responding to the question I will be using data for regional gross value added, GVA, for 2002 published on 23 March 2005 by the Central Statistics Office. I am assuming that this is also the data the Deputy is referring to.</P>
        <P>Gross value added represents the value of goods and services produced. The average output level in the BMW region, as measured by GVA, stood at just over 69% of the State average in 2002. The south and east region was 11.1% above the State average in 2002. The gap in GVA between the two regions has grown from 34.2% in 1995 to 42% in 2002. GVA is a measure of output and not of income and the regional breakdown should be viewed with caution. The Deputy should note that GVA includes total profits of companies, considerable levels of which arise in the State but accrue to non-residents. The level of GVA in the BMW region is approximately 92% of the EU 25 average. Furthermore, the <Col N="386"/>workforce that produces the GVA in a region may not live there and may bring their incomes home to a neighbouring region.</P>
        <P>With respect to income, the CSO estimates that disposable income per person in 2002 in the BMW region was 8.2% below the State average. The similar measure for the south and east region was 3% above the State average. There are a number of points also to keep in mind. First, the 2002 data suggest that disposable income levels between the regions are converging. The gap of 11.2% in 2002 has narrowed from 12% in 2001 and 13.4% in 2000. Second, differentials in the cost of living and housing between the regions would suggest that the gap in prosperity between the regions is considerably narrower than the data for disposable income indicates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Convergence between the two regions has occurred in respect to employment. Data from the CSO quarterly national household survey indicate that, between the third quarter of 2000 to the third quarter 2005, the number employed increased by 20% in the BMW region compared with 13% in the south and east region, the labour force grew by 19% in the BMW region compared with 14% for the south and east region and the participation rate grew by 6% in the BMW region compared with 3% for the south and east region. In the third quarter of 2000, the unemployment rate in the BMW region was 1.6% above the rate for the south and east region. The rate of unemployment was lower in the BMW region in the third quarter 2005 at 4.4% compared with 4.7% in the south and east region.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that investments under the national development plan are delivered through a number of operational programmes, OPs, which are directly managed and implemented by Departments, the regional assemblies or other agencies. The responsibility of my Department is to ensure that resources are made available to meet the Government&rsquo;s objectives and to secure full drawing down of Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of Structural Funds. Departments have been asked to ensure that the investment objectives for the BMW region are prioritised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant progress continues to be made in the implementation of the national development plan in the BMW region. The most recent monitoring data reported to my Department indicate that overall around &euro;10.3 billion has been expended in the region under the plan over the period January 2000 to end June 2005. This represents 74% of total profiled expenditure for the years 2000 to 2006.</P>
        <P>Expenditure under the EU funded elements of the operational programmes will continue until the end of 2008. Therefore, significant levels of expenditure will be incurred in the years 2007 and 2008 which will have to be considered when viewing the rate of progress on the measures supported by the Structural Funds. To ensure full utilisation of Structural Funds and matching <Col N="387"/>public resources, expenditure levels should exceed 50% at the end of 2004 the midway point in the programming period. At the end of 2004, estimated expenditure of the Structural Funds and matching public resources amounted to &euro;1.4 billion or 72% of profile. This is well above the midway target and should ensure that all Structural Funds and matching public resources for the programming period 2000-06 are fully expended.</P>
        <P>With respect to the eventual outturn for the NDP, I expect the end 2006 position for the key economic and social infrastructure OP and employment and human resources development OP to be close to or above targets with the Exchequer contribution likely to be above profile. The position for the PEACE and technical assistance OPs will be close to their targets at the end of 2006. The regional programmes and the productive sector OP are unlikely to achieve their end 2006 targets, particularly for those measures that are not co-funded by the Structural Funds. The Exchequer contribution to the regional programmes is not expected to reach its target by the end of 2006. This relates to the level of EU co-<Col N="388"/>financing in the programmes where expenditure will continue until the end of 2008.</P>

	<P>The bodies and agencies under the aegis of my Department that are subject to freedom of information in respect of certain functions only are the Office of the Information Commissioner, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>Under section 46(1)(<i>c</i>)(<i>i</i>) of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 the Act does not apply to a record relating to &ldquo;a review under section 34 or an investigation under section 36,&rdquo;. This provides that matters relating to investigations by the Information Commissioner are excluded from the scope of the freedom of information legislation as it would be inappropriate to allow for requests in respect of ongoing reviews.</P>
        <P>Under section 46(1)(<i>c</i>)(<i>ii</i>) of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003, the Act does not apply to &ldquo;an audit, inspection or examination carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts 1923 and 1993, the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts 1866 and 1921 or any other enactment,&rdquo;. The general administration of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General comes within the scope of the Act while its constitutional functions are excluded. Article 33.4 of the Constitution provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Under section 46(1)(<i>c</i>)(<i>iii</i>) of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003, the Act does not apply to &ldquo;an investigation or examination carried out by the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act 1980&rdquo;. Matters relating to investigations by the Ombudsman are excluded from the scope of <Col N="390"/>the Act as the conduct of these investigations is covered by the Ombudsman Act 1980.</P>
        <P>In respect of the three bodies listed above, records that were created before the commencement of the review, investigation, audit, inspection or examination aforesaid or records relating to the general administration of the Office of the Commissioner, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Office of the Ombudsman are covered by the Freedom of Information Acts under section 46(1)(<i>iii</i>)(I) and (II).</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the European Parliament has set up a special committee of inquiry into the near collapse of a company (details supplied); if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that 6,500 Irish investors in the company have had their pension values seriously reduced due to the difficulties in this company; his views regarding the appointment of an investigator to represent the interest of Irish persons in this matter and who will work with the European Parliament&rsquo;s committee of inquiry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have noted the establishment of a special committee of inquiry by the European Parliament referred to by the Deputy. I understand that the committee will report on its findings within 12 months but will publish an interim report after four months. As the Deputy will be aware, the supervision of a United Kingdom based entity is the exclusive responsibility of the United Kingdom regulator.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has, however, actively assisted Irish policyholders affected by developments in the company referred to by the Deputy by requesting information from the United Kingdom authorities and passing any information it received onto Irish policyholders. <Col N="391"/>My Department has been informed by the Financial Regulator that the regulator will inform Irish policyholders of any new information that comes to its attention that may be of assistance to them. The question of appointing an investigator or other individuals to represent the interests of particular classes of policyholders is a matter for the committee to decide within its own rules of procedures and those of the European Parliament.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent relevant information available relates to corporation tax returns submitted for accounting periods ending in 2003. An estimated breakdown of the figures for corporation tax returns on a geographical basis is available on the basis of bailiwick, meaning the jurisdiction or boundaries within which Revenue sheriffs, county registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt. It equates geographically with counties.</P>
        <P>Companies are associated on the tax record with the county address of the head office or branch with which contact is established for tax purposes, which may be different to the city or county addresses of other branches. The number of companies with corporation tax returns submitted for 2003 for the Donegal bailiwick was almost 2,200. These companies are liable to corporation tax on their taxable profits.</P>

	<P>The policy in my Department in respect of bullying, as it is throughout the Civil Service, is contained in a document entitled A Positive Working Environment &mdash; An Anti-Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying Policy for the Civil Service. The document, which was revised in July 2005 and came into effect on 1 September 2005, was produced by my Department in partnership with the staff unions through the equality sub-committee of General Council. The policy is designed to ensure compliance with the codes of practice issued under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equality Act 2004.</P>
        <P>All staff, including staff on contract, were made aware of the revised policy and were issued with information leaflets outlining the contents of the policy. The full document is contained in the Department&rsquo;s website and on the Department&rsquo;s intranet. There are no outstanding law cases in my Department regarding the issue of bullying by employees, nor have there been any such law cases settled or dealt with since 1 January 2000. Any complaints of bullying are investigated and resolved in accordance with the policy document outlined above. There is no specific legislation governing the issue of bullying, and at present, there are no plans in my Department to introduce any.</P>

	<P>For the year ending 31 December 2005, the following are the details of payments made in respect of exceptional performance in my Department.</P>
        <P>Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the Committee for Performance Awards. Since 2002, the funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the grades covered by the scheme. Within this overall <Col N="394"/>limit payments of up to 20% of basic salary can be made to individuals. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, available on the website <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information. A total of &euro;115,250 was paid to assistant secretaries under this scheme in 2005.</P>
        <P>Principals and assistant principals have a separate scheme which arises as a result of the restructuring agreement for these grades under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work. It provides that 1% of payroll for these grades be made available in the form of special service payments, for which staff are invited to apply, based on the following criteria, namely, contribution by the individual to the work of the Department in his or her job, special demands of the job and experience brought to the job. A total of &euro;38,610 was paid to these grades under this scheme in 2005.</P>
        <P>In 1993, the then Minister for Finance sanctioned expenditure in respect of merit awards to individual staff members or groups of staff below assistant secretary level by way of recognition for exceptional performance of duty which was based on 0.1% of the salary allocation, as published in the Revised Estimates, in any one calendar year. This percentage was revised to 0.2% in 1998.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An independent committee administers the merit awards scheme up to administrative officer-higher executive officer level, an assistant secretary group administers the awards at assistant principal and principal level. Nominees for the annual merit awards must, during the year, have demonstrated one or more of the following criteria, namely, given an exceptional performance in some aspect of his or her work, demonstrated unusual commitment and dedication to some aspect of his or her work and made a notable contribution to the successful achievement of the section&rsquo;s targets. A total of &euro;54,053 was paid to staff under the merit awards scheme in 2005. An amount of &euro;8,250 was paid in respect of <i>ex gratia</i> payments. <i>Ex gratia</i> payments are made in a number of situations which are outside the remit of the schemes already mentioned.</P>

	<P>Stamp duty exists on various financial cards in order to provide Exchequer revenue. The stamp duty on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes has existed for many years and when electronic means of money transfers were subsequently introduced, stamp duty was gradually extended to these products to ensure that the stamp duty from cheques, etc. was not eroded. The current annual rates of stamp duty are as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The stamp duty applies irrespective of the volume of bank transactions made. I do not believe that these changes are excessive and there is no evidence that they significantly discourage people from using these forms of transaction. In addition, section 128 of the Finance Act 2005 contained measures to eliminate a double stamp duty charge on the switching of financial cards. Stamp duties on financial cards are significant contributors to the Exchequer and are in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates generally low. In 2004, the stamp duty on ATM, laser and combined cards contributed &euro;35.3 million to the Exchequer while the yield from credit cards was &euro;59 million.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have received many representations and have met representatives of the Construction Industry Federation in relation to the proposed construction procurement reforms. The key objectives of the reforms are greater cost certainty, better value for money and more cost effective delivery of capital works projects. Our aim is to incorporate best practice from the private and public sectors into new standard forms for construction contracts and services.</P>
        <P>Currently, in public sector works contracts, there can be a significant variance between the price tendered and the final outturn cost. New draft standard forms of contract, conditions of engagement for construction related services and related guidance material have been drafted which provide for the introduction of fixed price lump sum contracts tendered on a competitive basis with appropriate risk transfer. These new contracts have been professionally produced based on best international practice in both the public and private sectors. They have also been subjected to independent private sector scrutiny.</P>
        <P>The contractor will be incentivised to control and manage specified risks and deliver projects on time and within budget. While there will be higher tender prices, the final cost should be less than under existing arrangements. In respect of construction related services, the new arrangements will end the present situation where a significant proportion of the fees are calculated by reference to the final outturn cost. In effect, the present arrangements can lead to an unacceptable situation where fees rise as project costs rise. The new conditions of engagement will provide for fixed price lump sum contracts as the norm for these appointments also but without compromising on quality.</P>
        <P>These new documents issued to the construction industry and relevant professional bodies via the Forum for the Construction Industry from April to June 2005. My Department has been involved in an intensive consultation process on these documents with the industry and the professional bodies since July of last year. During these extensive discussions, their views, comments and concerns have been outlined in considerable detail. My Department has sought to address these concerns where possible but with<Col N="398"/>out compromising Government policy on construction procurement reform. The consultation process is expected to be completed shortly with the aim of having the new contracts and related material ready for use as soon as possible in 2006.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that tax relief under the heading of health expenses may be allowed to kidney patients in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy as set out below. I should point out that health expenses relief is generally given by means of repayment after the tax year to which it relates. The figures quoted relate to the tax year 2004 and are the most up to date available. However, they are being updated at present to relate to the tax year 2005 and will be published shortly on the revenue website <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Where the patient attends hospital for treatment, relief under the heading of health expenses may be allowed in respect of expenditure incurred travelling, unlimited journeys, to and from hospital at the rate of 35c per mile. Where the patient uses a dialysis machine at home, relief under the heading of health expenses may be allowed in respect of the expenditure listed in a table.</P>

        <Quest>the dates in the past six months when the Revenue PAYE telephone No. 1890 33 34 25 has not been manned for a whole or part of a day.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the PAYE lo-call number 1890 33 34 25 was not available from 20 to 25 October 2005. This was due to the launch of a completely new and greatly expanded PAYE computer system at that time, which required significant live staff training on the new system.</P>
        <P>Since 14 November 2005, the operation of the PAYE lo-call number 1890 33 34 25 has been restricted to the hours 9.15 a.m. to 1 p.m. but with significant numbers of additional staff being provided to deal with phone queries during these hours. Throughout 2005, Revenue has been experiencing large increases in business volume, particularly in the PAYE area, and the 1890 service has been restricted to these hours to enable PAYE staff to address the substantial backlog of correspondence that had built up during October and November.</P>
        <P>This temporary restriction in the hours of operation of the 1890 telephone service does not reduce the overall number of telephone queries being dealt with on a daily basis because an increased number of operators are assigned to the system during these hours. For example, during the period 15 November 2005 to 23 December 2005, an average of 2,100 calls were handled daily through the lo-call number 1890 33 34 25 compared with an average of 1,300 calls handled daily in the period prior to the restriction. I am informed by Revenue that it is their intention to revert to an unrestricted service as soon as circumstances allow.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that a number of self service options via touch-tone telephone, text message or Internet have been introduced, allowing customers to automatically request forms and leaflets and to claim certain amendments to their tax credit certificates without the need to talk to a staff member. A much wider range of on-line facilities allowing PAYE taxpayers to file returns and make tax rebate claims and to update their tax credits and reliefs will be provided over the coming months.</P>

As the Deputy will note, the majority of accounts will not mature until 2007. However, it is not possible to state the amount expected to be paid out by the Exchequer in each of the 12 months after the SSIAs begin to mature as the eventual cost of the scheme is subject to a number of variables including where participants voluntarily withdraw from the scheme or indeed vary their monthly contributions over the remaining period of the scheme.

I will arrange to have such reports laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas upon receipt.</P>

	<P>The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. A person must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions, namely, persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs, persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs, persons without both hands or without both arms, persons without one or both legs, persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg or persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme that provides relief from VAT and VRT on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a per<Col N="402"/>son with certain disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car up to a certain limit.</P>
        <P>The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. A person must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions, namely, be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs, be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs, be without both hands or without both arms, be without one or both legs, be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg or have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P>A special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The group&rsquo;s report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, which included the qualifying disability criteria, I should say that given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The best way of addressing the transport needs of people with disabilities including the effectiveness, suitability or otherwise of the disabled drivers scheme in that regard will be progressed in consultation with the other Departments who have responsibility in this area. A car tax concession scheme can obviously only play a partial role in dealing with this serious issue.</P>

	<P>Ireland at present has the scientific capability, through the <Col N="405"/>seismic network managed by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, to record seismic events which affect the country. However by its nature a seismic network cannot predict the timing and location of future earthquakes and there is no effective technology available at present to do this. Ireland has low levels of seismicity and the earthquakes it has experienced in recent centuries have been relatively minor.</P>
        <P>Tsunami-generating earthquakes have been known in the North Atlantic region beyond Ireland, as have tsunamis generated from submarine landslides, but there is a low-probability threat to Ireland from such events.

	<P>I have no function in the regulating of pricing for services or quality of service in the fixed or mobile telecommunications market. The regulation of telecommunications operators, including regulating of pricing and services is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and regulations which transpose the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. The regulation of financial service costs in this State is a matter for the Irish Financial Services Regulator Authority.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have responsibility for overall telecoms policy. My main goal in this policy is to create conditions for sustainable growth and competition that will benefit the economic and social development of Ireland and facilitate competitive services.</P>
        <P>It is my belief that improving the market conditions to enhance competition is the best way to drive down mobile phone charges to the end user. The more competitive telecoms services that are on offer, the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">ComReg has, as one of its key objectives, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the promotion of competition in the exercise of its functions. Competition in the fixed and mobile <Col N="407"/>markets will drive down prices for consumers. I have no information to say that Irish mobile charges are generally the highest in Europe. ComReg&rsquo;s quarterly key data for the Irish communications market for Q3 2005 indicate that the average revenue per user, ARPU, for Ireland is &euro;47 per month. Switzerland has the highest at &euro;48 per month.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose to introduce a Bill in the D&aacute;il later this year, the Communications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will include provisions for the granting of greater powers to ComReg to investigate overcharging and ensure greater compliance of regulatory obligations by operators by giving improved enforcement powers to ComReg. This Bill is the subject of a public consultation process at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is addressing the broadband infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open access, carrier neutral metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has so far delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country. This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide and these MANs are due for completion during 2006 and 2007. These MANs will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P>
        <P>A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the first half of 2006. The construction-installation phase is now under way, and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>
        <P>We are the lowest cost country in the OECD for international connectivity; our regional broadband pricing is now on a par with the best in Europe, and the price of basic broadband access is at the EU average. Furthermore, Ireland is now one of the cheapest locations in the world for international leased lines.</P>

	<P>The National Salmon Commission is a statutory body established to assist and advise me, as Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, regarding the conservation, management, protection and development of the wild salmon and sea trout resource in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The terms of reference, which are set out in the National Salmon Commission (Terms of Reference) Order 2005, SI No. 627 of 2005, are designed to focus the salmon commission in its task of considering what management mechanisms might be required to achieve the alignment of salmon exploitation, both at national and district levels, on the scientific advice by 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The salmon commission is required to ensure that any recommendations with regard to compensatory measures that it makes must be predicated on the basis that the State will not contribute to any funding that may be required for such measures unless a public good is identified, justified and quantified. I would also expect the salmon commission to take on board the recommendation made by the joint Oireachtas committee in its recent report on salmon &ldquo;that any compensatory schemes should largely be funded by those stakeholders who would be the main economic beneficiaries of more salmon being free to return to the rivers&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Bearing in mind the statutory role of the salmon commission as an advisory body, I do not expect the commission to negotiate any compensatory package that might be identified. I would, however, expect that the commission would have thoroughly examined and considered all of the options and alternatives before making any recommendation.

        <P>As the complaint concerns drift net fishing in Irish waters, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on a response that issued to the European Commission on 16 November last. As the correspondence between the European Commission and the Irish authorities may, however, be considered an initial step in possible infringement procedures against Ireland on this issue, I am advised that the matter remains <i>sub judice</i> and that I cannot therefore comment on the exact details of our response at this time.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I, as Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, rely on the advice of the National Salmon Commission, which is a statutory advisory body, in determining conservation and management measures for the wild Irish salmon fishery. In order to assist it in this task, I have provided specific terms of reference for the National Salmon Commission which are set out in the National Salmon Commission (Terms of Reference) Order 2005, SI No. 627 of 2005.</P>
        <P>These terms of reference require, <i>inter alia</i>, that any practical recommendations made by the National Salmon Commission to me having regard to the conservation, management, protection and development of the national salmon resource must be considered regarding national obligations under relevant legislation of the European Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am satisfied that the advice provided to me by the salmon commission and the fisheries boards&rsquo; managers for the 2006 salmon fishing season and beyond, will have full regard to and take account of the requirements of Council Directive 92/43/EEC, otherwise known as the Habitats Directive, in so far as they apply to the wild salmon species.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that under his Department&rsquo;s group broadband scheme, an application was made by a group (details supplied) in north County Wexford to bring broadband to the Courtown area, that part of the process for funding was to prove that a market for broadband existed in the area, that the group did extensive research to obtain this proof, that their application was approved and that Eircom then introduced broadband to the area to the disadvantage of this group, which effectively did market research at its own expense for the benefit of Eircom, that this involved the sudden entry of Eircom into an area that had been ignored since the laying of the service line many years before immediately upon completion of the approved group&rsquo;s market research; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s Parliamentary Questions Nos. 560, 561 and 562 of 28 September 2005, the application by Dublin Port Company for approval for the reclamation of an area of some 21 hectares in Dublin Bay was accompanied by an environmental impact statement, EIS.

        <P>The consultants&rsquo; report was commissioned to inform the consideration of the port company&rsquo;s application, and it is not considered appropriate to make it available before a decision is made on that application. Full consideration of the port company&rsquo;s application would involve a process of public consultation in which the EIS and other information concerning the application would be made available for examination. Interested persons or bodies would have an opportunity to make submissions or observations on the proposal, and any such views would be considered carefully in coming to a decision on the matter.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for coast protection rests with the property owner whether it be a local authority or a private individual. In July 2002 the Department requested all coastal local authorities to submit proposals, in order of <Col N="413"/>priority, for consideration in the context of the 2003-06 national coastal protection programmes. Waterford County Council submitted proposals for coast protection works at Cunnigar phase 2, Ballyvoile phase 1 and 2, Helvick and Bunmahon.

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Lobster fishermen have been required to be appropriately licensed and registered under the Sea Fisheries Acts since the introduction of the fishing boat register in 1990. Despite this, however, in recent years it was found that a considerable number had failed to regularise their position in this regard. To deal with this problem the scheme for the licensing of traditional pot fishing boats in the Irish inshore fleet was introduced in 2003 with the support of the Commission. This scheme gave established fishermen who had not previously registered their vessels the opportunity to regularise their position. Over 700 applicants were successful and offered licences in 2004. The completion by applicants of the requirements for licensing and registration is in progress at present. It is necessary to finalise the registration of all successful applications under the scheme as soon as possible because of the European Commission&rsquo;s requirement to finalise the fleet capacity limits for Ireland. The Licensing Authority for Sea-Fishing Boats has, therefore, informed remaining applicants who have not yet completed the requirements for licensing that they must do so by 10 February 2006.</P>
        <P>The scheme for the licensing of traditional pot fishing boats was an exceptional measure. Any person who now wishes to obtain a fishing boat licence to engage in lobster fishing can apply to the licensing authority, and will be dealt with in the normal way under current sea fishing boat licensing policy which requires the provision of full replacement capacity.</P>
        <P>Regarding management and conservation of inshore stocks, I have asked Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, to work with local inshore groups with a view to putting in place strengthened management and conservation measures for inshore stocks around the coast. I understand that BIM is working actively with local groups and will be bringing forward appropriate measures for inshore stocks.</P>

	<P>The enforcement of the European and national regulations prohibiting the taking of undersized and v-notched lobsters forms part of the inshore fisheries conservation work routinely carried out by the Department&rsquo;s sea fisheries protection officers.</P>
        <P>Inspections and checks are made at the landing places used by lobster fishermen, of lorries that collect catches of lobsters for export and at the storage facilities of those exporters engaged in the lobster trade. The conservation work is generally well supported by the fishermen concerned as the v-notching of lobsters and the routine enforcement of minimum landing sizes for lobsters is seen to have a positive impact on the recovery of the stock.</P>
        <P>The regulation of lobster fisheries has also been well supported by a poster and information campaign conducted by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, in which fishermen are advised as to the legal provisions pertaining to lobster fishing.</P>

        <P>While I have no direct knowledge of the situation in Guinea, I would be very concerned about activities as described in the report published. The problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated, IUU, fishing in general is a cause for serious concern. The EU has moved to address this problem through its plan of action on IUU fishing adopted in 2002 and the Council Conclusions on Fisheries Partnership Agreements negotiated in 2004 during the Irish Presidency, which makes it a specific requirement for each such agreement to take action to combat IUU fishing. In the specific case of the current protocol to the agreement with the Republic of Guinea, there is a provision for the payment of &euro;800,000 <Col N="416"/>for the purchase of at least two surveillance vessels to combat illegal fishing. Successful action against this problem, wherever it occurs, requires commitment on all sides, including, crucially, the local sovereign authorities.</P>

	<P>The fishing vessel decommissioning scheme was launched on 4 October 2005. The deadline for receipt of applications for the scheme was 1 November 2005. Following the first phase of the approvals process, letters of offer issued to those applicants who met the mandatory eligibility criteria, in line with EU rules and who opted to decommission their vessels in the first round in late November 2005. In December, BIM, which is the implementing authority for the scheme, paid grants totalling &euro;4.1 million in respect of the first 15 vessels decommissioned. Approvals in respect of the planned <Col N="417"/>second and third tranches of the scheme will issue during 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The applicant referred to by the Deputy has been advised by BIM that their application did not meet the mandatory eligibility criteria on its initial assessment. The applicant has also been advised that their application is being reviewed, and they have been given the opportunity to supply any further supporting data regarding eligibility. The Department has recently received further data and it is currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the applicant&rsquo;s vessel is liable for harbour dues and that the vessel remains docked. However, this is not due to the decommissioning scheme, rather it is due to the fact that the vessel fishing licence expired on 30 June 2005, because it does not have an EU mandatory certificate of compliance, which is a matter for the owner of the vessel.</P>
        <P>I am also aware that a small number of other applicants are in a similar position. These applicants have also been given the opportunity to supply further supporting data regarding eligibility.</P>
        <P>I recently secured additional funding for BIM for the decommissioning scheme in 2006 and I can assure the Deputy that there will be no unnecessary delay either by the Department or BIM in assessing any additional data supplied by applicants or in paying grants once any of these applicants has fully complied with all of the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 594 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to recent EU Internet statistics there are over two million Internet users in Ireland. This represents user growth of 163% in the last four years and a market penetration per population of 51.2%, which compares favourably with the EU average of 48.9%.</P>
        <P>However, the relatively low ranking of Ireland against other European countries in various broadband league tables reflects the late launch of competitive, affordable broadband by private <Col N="418"/>broadband service providers in Ireland and the slow take up by consumers.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open-access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget.</P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start early this year. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These MANs will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area.</P>
        <P>A joint industry-Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme and will have provided every school in the country with broadband by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>In late 2004, the Government set a target of 400,000 broadband subscribers to be achieved by the end of 2006. Since that target was set, the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled to reach 208,000 by the end of September 2005, an increase of over 19% in comparison to the previous quarter, according to ComReg&rsquo;s latest quarterly report on key trend in the electronic communications sector. All the indicators are that this growth in subscriber numbers will continue to grow across a range of broadband technologies. The Government&rsquo;s broadband target is to be within the top half of EU countries by the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>In 2004 there were over 80 Internet service providers, today there are over 156 companies listed by ComReg, with at least 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly, and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.</P>
        <P>In essence, there are broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to virtually any broadband customer in Ireland right now. The rate of <Col N="419"/>uptake is dependent on access by the service providers to suitable infrastructure.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>Technological advances have brought broadband to the forefront of communications in just a few years but the service providers have not risen to the challenge to deliver the service in all areas. Market forces, and the availability of suitable infrastructure and backhaul, will determine whether a company offers broadband in any area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A principal reason for the slow roll-out of broadband services generally has been the lack of investment by the private sector in suitable infrastructure. My Department is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building open-access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, in association with the local authorities, using Government and European <Col N="420"/>regional development fund funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Under phase one of the scheme a MAN was built in Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>My Department also administers a group broadband scheme which delivers broadband to many underserved areas. Under this scheme, broadband projects have been approved for Castlecomer, Clough, Moneenroe, Ballyragget, Urlingford, Johnstown, Gatabaun and Callan in County Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie </i>gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless. The website also lists prices of the various service levels on offer and contact details for each service provider.</P>

	<P>Recent events in the European gas market demonstrate the importance of having indigenous gas in the context of security of supply. As regulator for the Corrib gas field, I have ensured through the consent processes, approval of production profiles and a field management plan whereby the recoverable reserves of gas will be maximised. The sale of produced gas is ultimately a matter for the developers of the field.</P>
        <P>In addition to security of supply, the Corrib field will act as a catalyst for the extension of the Bord G&aacute;is gas distribution system, facilitate the improvement of the region&rsquo;s infrastructure, increase local employment, provide tax revenues and encourage investment in oil and gas exploration.</P>

	<P>Under the existing licensing terms, which were introduced in 1992, no royalties or production levies are payable. The rationale for these attractive terms is the comparatively low level of commercial finds and the challenging environment and deep waters of the Atlantic margin. These terms, and their rationale, have been accepted and implemented without change by every Government since 1992. I should point out that royalties are payable on gas from the Kinsale Head gas field since the discovery of the field in 1971 and the start of production in 1978 pre-date the 1992 terms.</P>
        <P>I have no proposals at present to change the existing regime for royalties.</P>

	<P>The development of renewable energy technologies is<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="434"/><?oasys _fc ?>a key priority for the Government. The constraints to the greater deployment of these technologies in the electricity market at this time is a combination of concerns about system stability in the case of wind powered technology and the technical status of and market interest in the other renewable energy technologies as well as cost.</P>
        <P>The ongoing growth of these technologies on the electricity system will be achieved in incremental phases. I have already announced a new support programme to assist developers to construct additional renewable energy powered electricity generating plants. The aim of the REFIT programme and the preceding AER programme is to more than double the contribution of renewable energy technologies from approximately 5% of total electricity consumption to more than 13% by 2010. I am confident that the contribution of the renewables will continue to expand on the basis that technological breakthrough will over time enable us to harness them more effectively and cheaply.</P>

	<P>The future development of An Post and its postal services is, in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of An Post.</P>
        <P>I believe that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post, both in delivery of mails and as a quality service provider of Government and financial services through its nationwide network of post office outlets but the market for traditional postal and post office services is changing globally and meeting customer needs has become more important than ever. With globalisation, liberalisation and developments in technology that are changing the way people communicate, all national postal operators, including An Post, have to change very rapidly to stay competitive and commercial in the European postal market.</P>
        <P>In order to remain competitive, An Post needs to make the best possible use of its long established and trusted brand name and deploy its resources in a manner which continues to serve existing customers&rsquo; needs and attracts additional customers for a range of new services.</P><Col N="435"/><?oasys _fc ?>
        <P>There is also agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future. With this in mind, the board and management of An Post prepared a recovery plan, incorporating details of proposed new collection and delivery arrangements, which I believe is vital to the re-establishment of the company on a more secure financial footing.</P>
        <P>Following extensive negotiations between An Post management and An Post trades unions, the parties accepted Labour Court recommendations on proposed new collection and delivery arrangements.</P>
        <P>This welcome development will now pave the way for full implementation of the change programme that is so essential to placing the company on a firm financial footing and securing its future in an increasingly competitive and technologically changing market.</P>
        <P>With regard to the future of the post office network, this Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network as set out in the programme for government. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these social benefits.</P>
        <P>As a commercial company, the challenge ahead for An Post is to develop a strategy that satisfies the needs of existing customers, while attracting new customers into the post office. An Post has already had some success in winning new business and continues to benefit from a considerable amount of Government business, especially in the areas of social welfare payments and savings products.</P>
        <P>The An Post network comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country. In the European context, Ireland still has the highest number of post offices per head of population. In recent years some network restructuring has been undertaken. This activity is in line with similar trends across Europe. In addition to the post office network, An Post has also established 2,864 Postpoint outlets in retail premises of which 600 can be used for bill payment.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s objective to maintain the largest, economically sustainable post office network possible. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size. While the Government will support the network in any way it can and has demonstrated its commitment in a tangible fashion, with a &euro;12.7 million capital injection in 2003, the way forward is for An Post to enhance existing services and, <Col N="436"/>building on existing strengths, to develop new product offerings.</P>
        <P>The network has a high footfall and to capitalise on these advantages it is essential that existing and new services are developed to meet customer requirements. The network also has the capacity and potential to deliver more private business especially in financial services and opportunities are actively being pursued by An Post in this area. Indeed, on foot of substantial investment in computerisation, a significant amount of extra business has already been obtained for the network in terms of banking and utility business. Currently 95% of An Post&rsquo;s business is conducted through automated offices.</P>
        <P>I have also asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long term viability of the post office network and in this light, An Post is currently working on a new financial services initiative which could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices. If the initiative proves to be successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.</P>

	<P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has lead responsibility for Government policy on meeting Ireland&rsquo;s target under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The energy sector will make its contribution to meeting our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol through participation in the EU emissions trading scheme. While the energy sector plays an <Col N="438"/>active part in contributing to the attainment of Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto objective, the Government continues to be committed to the maintenance of a balanced fuels policy in the interest of security of supply. Fuel mix will continue to be a critical component in national security of supply given Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imports for about 80% of fuel for electricity generation.</P>
        <P>We are committed to increasing electricity generated from renewable sources to a minimum of 13.2% of total consumption by 2010 in line with EU requirements. I have already announced that the future support scheme for renewable energy will be on the basis of a fixed price as opposed to rounds of competitive tendering and I expect that wind generation will remain the dominant technology in the short term for delivering this target. I intend that the forthcoming energy policy consultative paper will address strategies to both broaden and deepen the renewable energy base.</P>
        <P>In addition, as announced in the recent budget I am putting in place new measures, which are designed to complement and expand on initiatives already in place in the renewable electricity, transport and heat sectors. The measures include a multiannual financial package of &euro;65 million for the roll out of renewable energy schemes and a five year biofuels excise relief package costing &euro;205 million. These programmes will assist the large-scale deployment of renewable sources of energy over the next five years in the bioenergy, biofuels, CHP and domestic energy sectors.</P>
        <P>Energy efficiency has a significant role to play in reducing both in reducing energy demand and lowering emissions and is often described as the cheapest and cleanest method of meeting these objectives. Our primary energy intensity has been decreasing since 1990 with the average decrease being 3% per annum. It is essential that we continue to build on this successful base by raising awareness right across the economy and bring about a step-change in the way that we use energy.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the provision of telecommunications services throughout the country rests with Eircom as the designated universal service provider under the European Communities (Electronic <Col N="439"/>Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and Users&rsquo; Rights) Regulations 2003, SI 308 of 2003, transposing Directive 2002/22/EC. The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, is the authority responsible for designation and regulation of the universal service provider.</P>
        <P>My Department regularly reviews all aspects of the broadband market and holds discussions with broadband interest groups, both public and private, to listen to their concerns. These discussions are ongoing, occasionally involving the State bodies, referred to by the Deputy, and typically cover a range of issues relevant to broadband supply and demand nationally.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the local infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget.</P>
        <P>This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start early in 2006. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These metropolitan area networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>In June 2004, the contract for management of the Government and local authority regional metropolitan broadband networks was awarded to E-Net, a company based in Limerick. The term of the contract is 15 years. E-Net operates as a wholesaler of access to the MANs and offers a full suite of products including ducting, sub-ducting, dark fibre, high level managed capacity, co-location facilities and relevant auxiliary services. Under phase one, 23 networks have now been completed and handed over to E-Net. Activity has now begun on the networks with several customer contracts being signed by E-Net, including arrangements for backhaul.</P>
        <P>My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area, with each application being assessed by the Department&rsquo;s technical advisers. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.</P>
        <P>A joint industry and Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the beginning of 2006. This is a crucial strand in the <Col N="440"/>strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources&rsquo;s wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. The construction and installation phase is now under way, and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.</P>
        <P>The Government believes that broadband connectivity forms a significant part of ICT development. High speed, resilient, low cost broadband is an essential feedstock for that sector. It has, and will continue to play, a vital role in moving Ireland to the forefront of knowledge-based economies in the world.</P>

	<P>A proposal to update the EU television without frontiers directive, to keep pace with rapid technological and market developments in Europe&rsquo;s audiovisual sector was tabled by the European Commission in December last.</P>
        <P>The most significant aspect of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal is directed at updating the definition of the services that would be covered by the directive to ensure that all audio-visual services that are of the same nature as &ldquo;traditional television broadcasting&rdquo; should be subject to the same rules.</P>
        <P>The provisions of an amended directive will be important to Ireland as a significant amount of the television watched by Irish audiences is not subject to Irish regulation. Accordingly, the mini<Col N="441"/>mum guaranteed regulatory measures included in the directive are of real consequence. I am of the view that the Commission&rsquo;s proposal does not adequately address the issue of jurisdiction over broadcasters and broadcasting services. Ireland has consistently argued that broadcasting services that are primarily targeted at this market should be subject to Irish rules. Ireland, along with a number of other member states, has made clear its concerns in this regard to the EU Commission. This is an issue that Ireland will continue to address as the proposals for an amended directive are discussed in the Council and working group meetings.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>Technological advances have brought broadband to the forefront of communications in just a few years but the service providers have not risen to the challenge to deliver the service in all areas. Market forces, and the availability of suitable infrastructure and backhaul, will determine whether a company offers broadband in any area.</P>
        <P>A principal reason for the slow roll out of broadband services generally has been the lack of investment by the private sector in suitable infrastructure. My Department is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building open-access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, in association with the local authorities, using Government and European Regional Development Fund funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Under Phase I of the scheme, a MAN was built in Letterkenny and, under Phase II, a MAN for Ballybofey is at the design and planning stage. It is expected to be completed in 2007.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services and the development and the roll-out of telecommunications technology is primarily a matter for the industry itself. The telecoms market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions.</P>
        <P>As Minister with responsibility for policy in this sector, I welcome the introduction of more innovation and competition in the sector, the entry of new players, and new product offerings from existing and new suppliers, which mean greater choice and lower prices for consumers.</P>
        <P>In 2004 there were over 80 Internet service providers, today there are over 156 companies listed by ComReg, with at least 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly, and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.</P>
        <P>In essence, there are broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to virtually any broadband customer in Ireland right now. The rate of uptake is dependent on access by the service providers to suitable infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Government is playing its part in addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high speed, open access, carrier neutral metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has so far delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country. This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide and these MANs are due for completion during 2006 and 2007. These metropolitan area networks will allow the private sector to offer world class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>

	<P>The Government has decided that a fundamental restructuring of the inland fisheries sector would result in a better model for the State&rsquo;s role in the sector, better resource management, more and better involvement of stakeholders, better corporate governance and value for money. The existing fishery catchment areas, which are based on river systems, however, will be unaffected by the proposed restructuring of the regional fisheries boards.</P>
        <P>It is proposed, in the future, to align the management of inland fisheries with the river basin districts specified in the water framework directive. The regional advisory boards, which will succeed the current regional fisheries boards, will be based on the existing regional structures initially but will be realigned with the river basin districts in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the conservation, protection, management and development of the inland fisheries resource rests with the central and regional fisheries boards. The central and regional fisheries boards devote considerable effort and resources to the promotion of angling and, in collaboration with the tourist authorities, to angling tourism.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that in November 2005, I published details of the Government&rsquo;s new policy for the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector in Ireland. As a first step in this restructuring process, the Government has decided to establish a National Inland Fisheries Authority, NIFA, which will subsume the executive functions of the central and regional fisheries boards.</P>
        <P>In setting up this new authority, discussions will take place between the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the <Col N="446"/>Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism with a view to specifying the role of the inland fisheries sector in support of the areas of angling, tourism and leisure development. This consultation process will also entail the development of a decision-making and accountability framework to ensure that policies, strategies and processes within the inland fisheries sector in these areas are co-ordinated with those of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and its agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am confident this particular element of the reform decided by Government is necessary to ensure that our tourism and recreational angling sector thrives and reaches its full potential. This reform will allow for the development of more coherent policy and strategy for tourism and recreational angling which will retain all that is best in the sector while at the same time making the role of the State in delivering on its objectives in this area more focused and effective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 677 and 680 together.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the rights of migrant workers and their families, while they need to be kept under active review, are already protected under existing national legislation and under the Constitution, as well as under EU law. In addition, the rights of migrant workers and their families are also addressed by Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under international human rights instruments to which the State is already a party. These international instruments include, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
        <P>This convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990, and it entered into force on 1 July 2003, following ratification by the requisite number of states &mdash; 20. The convention has been open for signature and ratification since December 1990. However, to date only 34 states have ratified it. No European Union member state has as yet signed or ratified the convention, nor has any indicated an intention to do so.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the views of the Irish Human Rights Commission in favour of ratification of the convention. The matter has also been raised on a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il, most recently on 22 November 2005. The case for ratification has been examined by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has lead responsibility on the issue.</P>
        <P>The position essentially is that, in order for Ireland to ratify the convention, significant changes would have to be made across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing employment, social welfare provision, education, taxation and electoral law. These changes would also have implications for our EU commitments. The operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK might also possibly be affected.</P>
        <P>The situation is being kept under review.</P>

	<P>The Government fully supports the holding of a public inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane on 12 February 1989 as recommended by Judge Peter Cory in his report of 1 April 2004.</P>
        <P>The British Government has proposed establishing an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005. Since the Inquiries Bill was first published, the Government has had concerns that the legislation would not allow an inquiry established under it to meet the necessary standards of independence and openness, in line with the commitment made by the Governments at Weston Park and in line with the recommendations of Judge Cory.</P>
        <P>The Government has raised these concerns repeatedly with the British authorities, including in contacts between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. The Government has outlined its position in statements at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and at the Council of Europe. The Taoiseach also raised the matter with President Bush when they met in March 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also raised this issue with Secretary of State Hain on a number of occasions, including at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in June 2005 and again at our meeting in Belfast on 19 December, reiterating our call for an inquiry into this matter that was both independent and public.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has maintained regular contact with the family of Mr. Pat Finucane and I met them on 15 November 2005. The Government will continue to give its strong support to the family in its pursuit of a full public inquiry that is compliant with the Weston Park agreement and the key requirements set out in the Cory report.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The embassy provided consular assistance to him and his family, including raising with the prison authorities issues in respect of his health and his conditions in detention. The embassy also liaised with his attorney on various issues, including his deportation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 9 July 2002 the sentence on the person concerned was overturned on appeal and a suspended sentence was imposed. The embassy arranged for the issue of an emergency travel document to facilitate his return to Ireland on 15 July 2002.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsequent to the person&rsquo;s release and return to Ireland, the embassy has raised his case on several occasions with the South African authorities, including his request for a presidential pardon. In August 2003 the South African authorities informed the embassy that a response would be forthcoming on the case. It is the embassy&rsquo;s understanding that, subsequent to this, the person concerned was contacted directly by the Director-General of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development in South Africa, who stated that he was &ldquo;satisfied that, as far as your conviction and sentences are concerned, justice has been done in your matter&rdquo;. He also concluded that he could &ldquo;not recommend a pardon in respect of his convictions&rdquo;. I understand that this remains the South African position.</P>

	<P>I share the concerns of the Deputy on the reported killing of 22 people in the Curumani region of Colombia, near the border with Venezuela. Investigations by the Organisation of American States and the Colombian authorities indicate that the number killed was in fact lower, at eight dead and one person missing. The reports suggest that the killings took place in the context of a territorial dispute between elements of the right wing Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC, paramilitaries and the left wing Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional, ELN. A criminal investigation is underway. The killings have been widely condemned.</P>
        <P>Ireland is committed to supporting the ongoing peace process in Colombia, which aims to end the 40 year internal conflict in that country. The EU <Col N="450"/>General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted conclusions on Colombia on 3 October 2005 which principally address the Columbian Justice and Peace Law. That law provides an overall legal framework for demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into society. The law, which was adopted through a lengthy democratic political process, strikes a difficult balance between peace and justice. The overall assessment of the Council was that, if implemented effectively and in a transparent manner, the law will have a positive effect on peace building in Colombia. At its meeting on 7 November 2005, the Council reiterated the need to intensify support for the Colombian peace process.</P>
        <P>The conclusions address the need for a negotiated peace settlement and call for illegal armed groups to demobilise. They also call on all parties to the conflict to respect human rights and international humanitarian law and commend the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia.</P>
        <P>The peace process in Colombia is making some progress, with a process of dialogue underway between the AUC and the Colombian Government. The Colombian Government is hopeful that up to 95% of right-wing paramilitaries grouped under the AUC banner will have disbanded by 15 February 2006. In addition, representatives from the Colombian Government and the ELN met in Cuba in December 2005 and are expected to meet there again next month with the aim of agreeing an agenda for more formal peace talks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is contributing &euro;390,000 over a three-year period to the Organisation of American States, OAS, peace and verification mission in Colombia. The mission&rsquo;s mandate is to provide comprehensive support to the Colombian peace process with a focus both on the demobilisation process and on the strengthening of institutions concerned with the rule of law. Promoting and defending human rights and justice are guiding principles of the mission. Ireland will work closely with its colleagues in this mission, including in ensuring that human rights standards are maintained during the process. Furthermore, an additional &euro;130,000 has been contributed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for the independent monitoring of human rights issues in support of the OAS mission in Colombia.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 688, 689, 692 and 694 together.</P>
        <P>Consular assistance is provided by my Department in a wide variety of circumstances and cases, which require different responses. In certain cases, the Department of Foreign Affairs is prepared to advance funds, based on an assurance of prompt repayment, to assist Irish citizens where this is judged to be urgent and necessary, and where individuals concerned cannot gain immediate access to such funds. All consular cases are necessarily assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to all the factors involved in each individual case.</P>
        <P>In the one exceptional consular case referred to by the Deputy, the court judgment permitted the three people to be released from prison under &ldquo;conditional freedom&rdquo;, on payment of a bond. My Department, at the request of the defence team, and given its particular and ongoing consular concerns about the safety of the three people, advanced the funds to facilitate the payment of this bond, on the basis of a firm undertaking to repay the sum involved. The funds advanced were repaid in full. This decision was taken by the Department in pursuit of its consular responsibilities, and on how best to respond to the specific circumstance in question, and was neither discussed nor taken at political level.</P>
        <P>The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to offer appropriate and sympathetic consular assistance to all Irish citizens abroad, including assessing each individual case on its merits.</P>

        <P>Persons holding Venezuelan passports are not required to have visas to enter Ireland.</P>
        <P>In applications from citizens of Ecuador and Columbia, the Department&rsquo;s central records relate to the numbers of applications from all nationalities processed by our individual missions and the visa office in Dublin. They are not disaggregated by the nationality of the applicant, or by the purpose of the visit. However, under the new AVATS visa issuing system, which is being developed at present, we envisage having the capacity to produce the type of management information reports and breakdowns sought by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>In order to be as helpful as possible, I set out in the following table the numbers of visa applications from Colombia and Ecuador processed through our Embassy in Mexico. These include applications received by the Honorary Consulates in Quito and Bogot&aacute;. A small number of visa applications for Ecuador were also processed by the Embassy in Buenos Aires, and these statistics are also included in the table. </P>

	<P>One member of staff is currently undertaking a full-time, 18-month study course at the <i>Ecole Nationale d&rsquo;Administration</i>, ENA, in Paris, under a scheme administered by the Department of Finance and the French Embassy. The course provides an opportunity to gain first-hand experience of the work of the French public sector and to make contacts with civil servants from France and from over 20 other countries represented on the course. It also provides an opportunity to further develop French language skills. The officer in question is due to return to the Department at the beginning of March. She will then take up a posting in September, in the Embassy in Paris, where her training and experience at ENA will be put to good use.</P>
        <P>Thirty-one officers are currently undertaking part-time or evening courses, with financial support from the Department. The following is a breakdown of the subject areas of the courses concerned: doctorate in governance; masters degrees in public management, policy analysis, community health, international relations, development management and economic policy; degrees in business studies, public management, law, industrial relations/human resource management, social studies, computer science and arts; diplomas in communications, public management, psychology and public relations; and certificates in personal effectiveness, managing performance and public management.</P>
        <P>In many cases, the subject areas are directly relevant to the role of the officer undertaking the <Col N="467"/>course. Examples include the community health and the development management courses being undertaken by officers working in the Department&rsquo;s development co-operation directorate, and the international relations course being undertaken by a number of diplomatic officers. All of the other courses are recognised as being of general benefit to officers working in the Civil Service. The Department&rsquo;s support for officers undertaking such courses is in line with current Civil Service policy to support and promote self-development and life-long learning, which contribute to enhanced workplace performance.</P>
        <P>A number of officials in the Department are also undertaking language studies, which are of direct relevance to the role and function of the Department.</P>

	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for two Votes, Vote 28 &mdash; Foreign Affairs and Vote 29 &mdash; International Co-operation. The Department commissions consultancies and external advice where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of the Development Co-operation Ireland, DCI, programme, <Col N="468"/>where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. I should add that the awarding of the contracts referred to in the following tables is done at official level, and I have had no personal involvement in the process. Details of expenditure on consultancies and legal advice under Votes 28 and 29 are set out in the following tables, Tables A to C.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the majority of expenditure on consultancies under Vote 28 during the period in question relates to the upgrading of the Department&rsquo;s information technology infrastructure at headquarters and in our missions abroad, and to the development of an automated passport production system, APS.</P>
        <P>Consultancies undertaken by Development Co-operation Ireland under Vote 29 cover a wide range of sectors including HIV/AIDS, education, health and rural development. A high proportion of them concern the monitoring, review and evaluation of development programmes and projects commissioned at headquarters to ensure quality and value for money.</P>
        <P>While the Department has engaged legal and other experts to provide advice on policy matters during the period in question, it also sought advice on a range of administrative matters such as contracts, procurement and employment issues at headquarters and at our missions abroad. The Department of Foreign Affairs manages over 100 buildings abroad &mdash; residences for heads of mission and chancery offices &mdash; and legal advice is routinely sought from locally engaged lawyers on matters such as lease agreements, conveyancing and in undertaking major maintenance and refurbishment work.</P>
        <P>As the majority of the consultancies under Vote 28 for the period in question related to expert advice on a variety of technical matters or to representing Ireland at specialised meetings of international bodies, the question of the production of reports with recommendations for implementation did not usually arise. On Vote 29, a report was, in the normal event, produced at the end of each consultancy contract. The recommendations in these reports were implemented, as appropriate, in the developing countries concerned. </P><Col N="467"/>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs attaches the highest priority to supporting, promoting and fully implementing the Civil Service policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying <Col N="470"/>introduced by the Department of Finance in 2000. A revised version of the policy, entitled A Positive Working Environment, came into effect in September 2005 and was, as with the earlier version, brought to the attention of all staff by way of an internal office notice. The focus of the revised policy is on resolving disputes through mediation. It also introduced the concept of specially trained contact persons, who are available to provide information and support to staff members in the areas covered by the policy.</P>
        <P>Since the original introduction of the policy in 2000, the Department has held a series of talks and workshops at headquarters and also in missions abroad on the subject of bullying and harassment, in order to raise the level of awareness of the issues among staff at all levels. To date, over 500 staff across all grades have availed of <Col N="471"/>this training. More recently, the Department has provided intensive training in workplace and organisational mediation to selected staff members. Training in mediation and conflict resolution, tailored to reflect the focus of the revised policy, is also now being made available to line managers.</P>
        <P>Since January 2000, a total of four formal complaints involving allegations of bullying and harassment and one involving alleged sexual harassment have been made by staff members of the Department. Of these, three cases have been dealt with and two remain outstanding, one before the High Court and one before the Equality Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The question of introducing legislation in this area would be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have any role whatsoever in the process or decision making in this matter. This is a matter for the Accounting Officer of my Department.</P>
        <P>Two schemes involving annual performance-related pay and bi-annual merit awards are in operation in the Department of Foreign Affairs. These are the scheme of performance-related pay awards for officers at the level of deputy secretary and assistant secretary and the merit awards scheme for officials, the details of which are common to all Departments.</P>
        <P>A number of once-off merit awards were also granted during 2005 to officers based in the Passport Office, for their exceptional contribution to the successful introduction of a new automated <Col N="472"/>passport production and issuing system. One other once-off award was made last year in recognition of the exceptional dedication to duty of the officer concerned.</P>
        <P>With some exceptions, for example where gift vouchers below a certain value threshold rather than money are given, statutory deductions, including income tax, are made in the normal way on such awards.</P>
        <P>Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary have been, since 2002, covered by a scheme of performance-related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the Committee for Performance Awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme across the Civil Service, the range of awards and the total amounts paid by Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, which is available on the website <i>- www.finance.gov.ie</i>. The committee does not identify the amounts paid to individuals, as this is regarded as personal information.</P>
        <P>On the merit awards scheme, under the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget agreement with the Department of Finance a fund, amounting to 0.2% of the Department&rsquo;s salaries budget, is available each year to the Secretary General in respect of <i>ex gratia</i> payments or other awards to individual staff members or groups of staff, by way of recognition of exceptional performance of duty. This scheme is administered by a sub-group of the Department&rsquo;s partnership committee, which assesses nominations for merit awards and makes recommendations to the Secretary General. The objective of the scheme is to reward cases of genuinely exceptional performance by officers in grades up to, and including, counsellor/principal officer level. Particular attention is paid by the sub-group to the grades of nominees and to the nature and quality of the activities described in the written nominations.</P><Col N="471"/>

        <Quest>if his Department has produced an annual corporate procurement plan in respect of each of the years 2000 to 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The adoption of annual corporate public procurement plans by Departments is one of the recommendations of the National Public Procurement Policy Framework document issued by the Department of Finance in May 2005. The <Col N="473"/>development of such a corporate plan by each Department involves the evaluation of existing approaches to procurement, the setting of targets for value for money improvements in the purchase of goods and services and, in conjunction with the National Public Procurement Policy Unit, the development of in-house procurement expertise.</P>
        <P>Within Vote 28, Department of Foreign Affairs, the level of procurement undertaken by my Department is relatively small. The Department has, nonetheless, recently established a procurement management unit within its corporate services division. As well as ensuring compliance with best practice requirements and advancing procurement management reform, this unit is taking forward the preparation of the Department&rsquo;s annual corporate procurement plan. In accordance with the time frame prescribed by the National Public Procurement Policy Unit, the first corporate procurement plan for my Department will be adopted later this year.</P>
        <P>As regards Vote 29, International Co-operation, an outsourcing specialist was recruited in 2002 to oversee the commissioning of consultancies in our development aid programme. Since then, procedures and systems have been reviewed and strengthened to ensure that maximum value for money is achieved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is estimated that over 73,000 people in northern Pakistan lost their lives in the earthquake which struck south Asia on 8 October 2005. The earthquake severely affected the North-West Frontier and Kashmir Provinces of Pakistan causing widespread structural damage. Over 70,000 people were seriously injured, 3 million people lost their homes and 1 million jobs were lost.</P>
        <P>Former Taoiseach Mr. Albert Reynolds represented Ireland at a reconstruction conference convened by the Government of Pakistan on 19 November. Mr. Reynolds presented the report of his findings to me following the conference.</P>
        <P>I travelled to the affected region myself in December with my Dutch colleague. I met with President Musharraf and Prime Minister Aziz, both of whom briefed me on the challenges facing the country. I also met with the United Nations humanitarian co-ordinator for the relief effort, the Red Cross and Irish NGOs working in the region. I saw at first hand the devastation caused by the earthquake and the logistical difficulties in the relief and recovery effort. I visited GOAL in Bagh district and saw its food distribution network in operation. I visited Concern, which has adapted its long-term programme there to meet <Col N="474"/>the relief needs in the camps and surrounding area. Severe cold weather and snow has made delivery of relief supplies difficult. While there is some evidence of recovery, the delivery of emergency relief such as shelter, food, health services and the logistical support to deliver these services, continues to be a priority.</P>
        <P>The Government has pledged &euro;10 million in humanitarian relief and recovery assistance. Some &euro;8 million of this funding has been disbursed to UN agencies, the Red Cross family and Irish NGOs, which are providing much needed humanitarian assistance in the region. This places Ireland as one of the highest donors <i>per capita</i> to this disaster. The remainder of our assistance will be carefully targeted as additional needs emerge.</P>
        <P>My Department remains in close contact with the UN which, with the Government of Pakistan, is leading the relief effort. We are conscious of the continuing challenges facing the relief effort and the need to provide sustained and substantial relief, particularly over the winter period. Ireland will continue to play its part in the relief and recovery process over the coming months.</P>

	<P>There are currently four bodies under the aegis of my Department: the Advisory Board for Development Co-operation Ireland; the Development Education Advisory Committee, DEAC; the D&iacute;on committee; and the Ireland &mdash; United States Commission for Educational Exchange, known as the Fulbright Commission.</P>
        <P>The Advisory Board for Development Co-operation Ireland published its annual report for 2004 in June 2005. There is no requirement for the annual report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, a copy of the report was sent to each member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>The Development Education Advisory Committee, DEAC, offers policy advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Development Co-operation Ireland on development education and on ways to increase knowledge and understanding of development issues in Ireland. Its members are appointed for a period of two years in their personal capacity and do not receive any remuneration. DEAC does not produce an annual report.</P>
        <P>The D&iacute;on committee advises me on applications for funding from organisations that support our emigrants in Britain, as well as on issues of interest and concern to the Irish community. <Col N="475"/>With the exception of the Chair and secretary, who are serving officials in the Embassy of Ireland in London, the committee members serve in a voluntary capacity. The D&iacute;on committee does not produce an annual report. Details of my decisions on grants awarded to support our emigrants in Britain and elsewhere are published regularly.</P>
        <P>The Fulbright Commission is statutorily obliged to annually submit audited financial statements for presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The financial statement for the year ended 30 September 2004 has recently been received in my Department and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly.</P>

        <Quest>if all financial support for the Ethiopian Government will be withdrawn in view of the human rights abuses that are being carried out by and on behalf of the current administration; his views on whether continuing to fund such a regime is tantamount to endorsing its actions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s support to Ethiopia is focussed on addressing the basic needs of the rural poor. No Irish aid moneys go directly to the Government of Ethiopia via direct or general budget support.</P>
        <P>With a population now exceeding 70 million people, Ethiopia is Ireland&rsquo;s largest programme country. It is also the poorest, with over 30% of the population living on less than $1 a day and 76% on less than $2 dollars a day. It is ranked 170th out of 177 on the UN human development index.</P>
        <P>In Ethiopia, Ireland&rsquo;s assistance supports social safety net programmes which provide direct transfers to the poorest people in the country. Without such support &mdash; provided by Ireland, UK, the EC, the World Bank, UN World Food Programme, USAID and Canada &mdash; it is estimated that between 5 million and 7 million people in Ethiopia would face starvation each year.</P>
        <P>In addition, Irish assistance supports national and sub-national programmes managed by local authorities, providing health, education, water and sanitation and other services for their populations. We are funding the building of schools, health clinics, the sinking of wells and the improvement of sanitation. We are also assisting in the building and maintenance of rural roads which provide a key transport infrastructure for poor farmers. All these activities enhance the basic conditions of life for many thousands of poor Ethiopians. Our assistance is transforming the lives of the poorest.</P><Col N="476"/>
        <P>Our programme also has a strong focus on the promotion of better governance through investing in activities that aim to promote the voice of poor communities and make Government institutions more responsive to people&rsquo;s needs including capacity building assistance to the Human Rights Commission and civic education.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the quality and pro-poor focus of the aid programme in Ethiopia, I have deep concerns about the political and human rights situation there. I made my views clear to the Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires of the Ethiopian Embassy when I met him in the aftermath of the political disturbances last November. I condemned the lethal use of force by the security forces and called for an investigation into their behaviour. I also called for an end to random searches and arrests. An investigation commission has been established and a large number of detainees released. Ireland, along with our EU partners, continues to emphasise to the Government of Ethiopia, most recently in a meeting with the Ethiopian Prime Minister on 17 January, the need to respect human rights and the rule of law, to strengthen the democratisation process by opening a non-conditional dialogue with all opposition parties and allowing opposition parties and civil society organisations operate freely, and to allow the private media operate without restrictions and develop a media code of conduct. The EU also plans to send international observers to monitor the trial of 130 opposition and civil society leaders due to begin next month.</P>
        <P>Our aid programme is kept under constant review. In making any assessment and future decisions about Ireland&rsquo;s cooperation with Ethiopia, I will be guided by the situation on the ground and by close contact and liaison with Ireland&rsquo;s EU and like-minded development partners.</P>

	<P>Since 2002, Civil Service posts at the level of assistant secretary are covered by a revised scheme of performance related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for such awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within the overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals. The details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of thecCommittee &mdash; available on the website of the Department of Finance, <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information. My Department, under its administrative budget agreement with the Department of Finance, operates a merit award scheme for all staff up to and including the grade of principal officer. The maximum funding is subject to a ceiling of 0.2% of the annual payroll provision. The scheme was agreed through my Department&rsquo;s partnership process and awards are made on the basis of criteria, terms and conditions set out in the scheme. It provides for a minimum award of &euro;750 gross in the case of individuals and a minimum of &euro;150 gross in the case of members of teams.</P>

	<P>Since its decision to refuse further extension to planning on the site of the Tallaght stadium, my Department has been kept informed by South Dublin County Council of its ongoing efforts to regain ownership of the site. My Department has previously indicated that it is prepared to support South Dublin County Council in putting together a financial package which would ensure the completion of the stadium in Tallaght. However, such support was based on the plan to provide a soccer stadium for Tallaght that would serve as a viable long-term home for Shamrock Rovers Football Club. Given the significant funding likely to be required to complete the stadium, serious consideration must be given to the stadium accommodating two soccer clubs on a ground sharing basis, a concept recommended for Dublin clubs in the recent Genesis report on the Eircom League.</P>
        <P>South Dublin County Council recently wrote to my Department seeking clarification on whether funding will be available on the basis of the council&rsquo;s recent decision to complete the stadium but subject to certain modifications to the pitch, stand and dressing rooms to facilitate other sports. The facility needs of other sports have been provided for and will continue be so under the sports capital programme under which more than &euro;9.5 million has been allocated to clubs in the Tallaght area alone. However, there is a need for a modern modest size soccer stadium in Dublin, which this development in Tallaght would suitably meet when completed. Recent efforts to change the scope of the agreed <Col N="483"/>approach to the proposed project is likely to impact on the future capacity and the total cost of the stadium. Accordingly, I have advised South Dublin County Council that funding will not be available on the basis of council&rsquo;s current proposals for the completion of the stadium.</P>

	<P>The selection of London last July as the host city for the 2012 games offers Ireland an unprecedented opportunity for businesses, tourism and sport. I have met David Hanson, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, for discussions on a number of sports issues, including the opportunities relating to London hosting the 2012 summer Olympic games and paralympic games. The Minister and I agreed there were tremendous opportunities for both Northern Ireland and the Republic to benefit from the games. The existing close working relationships at Ddpartmental and Sports Council levels will provide a solid basis upon which to maximise the opportunities ahead. I have also discussed the situation with Richard Caborn, the British Minister for Sport, who has warmly welcomed the approach being undertaken on an all-island basis in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have been advised by the president of the Olympic Council of Ireland that a number of countries have inquired about the possibility of using Ireland as a base in the lead up to the London games. The attraction of Ireland to overseas teams participating in the games for acclimatisation and preparation purposes is an area on which the Irish Sports Council and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland could co-operate. The general assembly of the European Olympic committees held in Dublin last month was attended by leading figures from World and European Olympic organisations, including the oresident of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge. This major conference afforded a unique opportunity to draw the early attention of this highly influential group, including the successful London bid team who were also in attendance, to the many services Ireland can offer to Olympic squads from around the world.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the Government parties have invested in excess of &euro;700 million in sport. Of this amount, approximately &euro;500 million has been spent on the development of sporting facilities at a national, regional and local level. A significant proportion of this investment has gone towards developing a network of top quality facilities <Col N="484"/>around the country designed to meet the training, coaching and competition needs of our elite competitors in a wide spectrum of sports. Among the major projects that have been supported are the Croke Park stadium, the national aquatic centre, the national rowing centre at Inniscarra, the national tennis centre, the national boxing stadium, the national hockey stadium at UCD and the national coaching and training centre at the University of Limerick, which complements the wide range of top quality facilities provided at the university, many of which have been used by International sportspersons. In addition, the early delivery of the sports campus at Abbotstown, will be a key element to Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to attract competing athletes to locate here.</P>
        <P>With an estimated 1 million additional visitors to Athens for the 2004 Olympics, Ireland will be hoping to attract substantial additional visitors around the 2012 games with significant benefits for the tourism industry. Both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be considering how best to tap into the potential tourism spin-off from the Olympics in London in 2012. Ease of access to London from an increasing number of airports on the island will be an important factor in exploiting the tourism dimension of the games. The successful hosting the Special Olympics world summer games in 2003 greatly enhanced Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and credibility on the world stage as a safe and welcoming destination. This positive experience is something we can very usefully build on in planning how we might optimise the tourism opportunities of the Olympics in 2012. To give added impetus to the drive to capitalise on the sporting and tourism opportunities of the London Olympics, I intend to establish an interagency group to support the work of the agencies working in this area.</P>

The Lansdowne stadium project has made good progress and the company charged with delivery of the project, Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company, submitted the planning application for the project on 12 January 2006. The Government has also decided to proceed with the development of phase one of the sports campus project at Abbotstown and funds for the delivery of the project have been provided in my Department&rsquo;s Multiannual Capital Investment Framework 2006-2010. The estimated cost of the project is &euro;119 million.

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The promotion of individual areas, including towns such as Enniscorthy, is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency. While I may give general policy directives to IDA Ireland, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving from giving preference to one area over others. However, at the request of the agencies, I can and do assist them from time to time in their efforts to market Ireland and its regions for new investment and jobs.</P><Col N="488"/>
        <P>IDA Ireland believes it is important from a regional perspective to maximise the level of FDI locating in County Wexford and its overall strategy in the county is to work towards this objective. These companies not alone bring high wage jobs to the county but also have potential knock-on benefits in other sectors such as supply, distribution and transport, thus creating further investment-employment opportunities for local people in the immediate vicinity and surrounding areas, including Enniscorthy.</P>
        <P>The attraction of FDI to regional locations such as Enniscorthy is not an easy task, with clients looking at Ireland often only willing to consider larger centres that have the scale, infrastructure and services capable of sustaining their investment. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategic response in County Wexford is to concentrate its resources in the medium to long term on Wexford town, as it is the location with the greatest potential to develop as a first class location for attracting overseas industry. This does not mean, however, that it is are other areas in the county, including the promotion of Enniscorthy where suitable opportunities arise. Enniscorthy has an 11,000 sq. ft. enterprise and technology centre and, although there have been two IDA site visits to the centre, neither company has taken up the option on the facility. In this context it must be remembered that the investor decides where to locate a project.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland, which is the agency with primary responsibility for supporting indigenous industry, works through its network of 33 overseas offices and its network of offices in Ireland, to ensure the business partners, customers and associates of Irish companies are fully informed of the benefits of trading with Ireland. The agency is working with companies in its portfolio in Enniscorthy and in County Wexford generally and is also assisting client companies to grow their sales and exports and improve innovation so that they can compete on world markets. I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Wexford, including Enniscorthy.</P>

	<P>The issue of job creation by companies supported by the enterprise development agencies is a day to day matter for the relevant agencies and County Enterprise Boards <Col N="489"/>(CEB), and not matters with which I am directly involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enterprise Ireland recognises that there have been a number of significant job losses over the past number of years in County Wexford due to the closure of some key employers. Since 2003, 983 full time jobs created in client companies were offset by job losses of 1,141. Enterprise Ireland continues to work with client companies to help them become more competitive. Since 2003 the agency has approved funding of over &euro;4.7 million and made payments of over &euro;4.5 million to client companies in the county.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In May last year, I launched Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy 2005-2007. Under the new strategy Enterprise Ireland clients are offered a range of supports that assist them to increase their exports, sales and employment, and develop a more competitive and self-sufficient industrial structure. I also launched the Productivity Improvement Fund, which supports eligible manufacturing companies adopt advanced technologies and focus on skill developments to improve productivity, thus laying the foundation for export readiness. Enterprise Ireland also supports potential entrepreneurs via the Enterprise Start-Up programme in the south east, and through other programmes such as the South East Enterprise Platform Programme.</P>
        <P>County Wexford had a total of 1,993 people working in IDA Ireland supported companies at the end of 2004. This compares with 1,851 people in 2003 and 1,802 people in 2002. There is one IDA supported company in Enniscorthy, Reynaers Architectural Systems Ltd. IDA strategy for County Wexford in the medium to long term will be to concentrate resources on Wexford town as the location with the greatest potential to develop as a first class location for attracting overseas industry. In the short-term, IDA Ireland is concentrating efforts on New Ross where there is an available advance technology building to market to potential overseas clients.</P>
        <P>Wexford CEB has been proactively involved in promoting Enniscorthy as a centre for business and employment. Since its inception in 1993, Wexford CEB has approved just over &euro;2.5 million to businesses based in the Enniscorthy area, which represents 35% of total approvals for the entire county. These grants and other financial supports have assisted in the creation of 404 jobs in the area.</P>
        <P>The Enniscorthy Enterprise and Technology Centre was brought to fruition with support from both Wexford CEB and Enterprise Ireland, which provided funding under the community enterprise centre urban scheme. This 11,000 sq. ft. enterprise centre was completed in 2002, provides space for start-up businesses and also links closely with the education system in providing backup for small businesses. I understand that six of the seven units are now occupied and provide employment for 29 persons. Waterford Institute of Technology has a permanent presence in the <Col N="490"/>centre and provides an enterprise support unit which works closely with Wexford CEB in providing training and expertise to enterprises in the area. To date more than 500 people have received training, including 200 on third level certified courses.</P>
        <P>In relation to the advance factory in Enniscorthy, I understand that this is a privately owned enterprise funded under a BES scheme. Enterprise Ireland have informed me that, should any present or potential client companies express an interest in locating in the South East or more specifically in County Wexford, Enterprise Ireland will inform them of the factory in Enniscorthy. There have been two IDA site visits to the Enniscorthy site, but neither company has taken up the option on the facility.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 311 on 9 March 2005, Council Directive 96/82/EC &mdash; the Seveso directive &mdash; which was transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000 (S.I. No. 476 of 2000), requires, under Article 12, that the objectives of preventing major accidents and limiting the consequences of such accidents are taken into account by the member states in their land use policies and or other relevant policies. It requires, in the interests of safety, that these policies must take account of the need, in the long term, to maintain appropriate distances between establishments covered by the directive and residential areas, areas of public use and areas of particular natural sensitivity or interest. The directive does not make any provision for compensation in respect of any matter covered by it.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The directive further requires that the procedures set up to implement these policies must be designed to ensure technical advice on the risks arising from the establishment is available, on a case by case or on a generic basis, when decisions are taken. Regulation 29 of the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000 covers the provision of such technical advice to planning authorities by the Health and Safety Authority. The planning authorities are <Col N="491"/>the major decision makers in relation to the siting of plants which fall under the terms of the regulations and the subsequent granting of permission for additional developments. The planning authorities consult the HSA, which gives technical advice on land use policy. Circumstances may arise from time to time in which the implications of policy can, in the interests of health and safety, impose restrictions on usage of property. All plants affected by the directive are subject to the planning process, which in itself has an appeals process built in and is transparent. Likewise, property owners whose land use may be restricted or otherwise affected by a proposed plant are entitled to avail of the planning and appeal process.</P>
        <P>However, under section 190 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides compensation shall not be payable in respect of the refusal of permission for a proposed development which, &ldquo; (<i>a</i>) could, due to the risk of a major accident or if a major accident were to occur, lead to serious danger to human health or the environment, or (<i>b</i>) is in an area where it is necessary to limit the risk of there being any serious danger to human health or the environment&rdquo;. No changes relating to the matters referred to are proposed in the draft new regulations, which are due to be made shortly to replace the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000. The Planning and Development Act 2000 comes within the ambit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

	<P>Under the Redundancy Payments (Lump Sum) Regulations 2004 (S.I. No. 695 of 2004), which increased the weekly pay ceiling for calculating statutory redundancy to &euro;600 from &euro;507.90, the critical date for determining whether the higher ceiling should apply in any particular case is the date on which notification of redundancy was issued. In the case of the employee concerned, the date of notification was 3 <Col N="492"/>September 2004, well before 1 January 2005 when the regulations came into effect. Although the termination of employment date was 14 January 2005, the date used for redundancy calculation purposes is the date of notice of redundancy. As this preceded 1 January 2005, the old &euro;507.90 ceiling applied.</P>

	<P>In considering changes to the immigration system in the context of the proposed immigration and residence Bill, the issues of family reunification and residence status for migrants are being considered fully. There is no system of &ldquo;long-term resident&rdquo; or &ldquo;permanent resident&rdquo; in the immigration system. A person can after a period of time obtain permssion to remain &ldquo;without condition as to time&rdquo;. I am, however, examining the possibility of introducing a new status of &ldquo;long-term resident&rdquo;. A new status is being considreed whereby a person who has been legally resident in the State for a period of five years could apply for long-term resident status. The entitlements of this status would be greater than those of short-term or temporary residents and would, in many, respects be similar to those given to Irish citizens. A model which could be followed is that contained in the European Council directive on the status of long-term residents. The position on the admission of family members to Ireland to join non-EEA nationals here is as as follows: in all cases the person must be in a position to support his-her family without recourse to public funds. A non-EEA national who is not visa required and is working in the State on an employment permit or under the work authorisation scheme may apply for family reunification &mdash; spouse, minor child &mdash; immediately; and a non-EEA national who is working in the State under the working visa scheme may be joined by his-her family -spouse, minor children- in the State after three months; a non-EEA national who is visa required and is working in the State on an employment permit may apply for family reunification &mdash; spouse, minor child &mdash; on condition that he or she has been working here for at least 12 months and is likely to remain so for a similar period, that is, the work permit has been renewed. As a matter of course, my Department reviews the situation regarding family reunification and residence status for migrants on an ongoing basis.</P>

        <Quest>the number of jobs lost in the private sector in County Wicklow in the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The tabular statement sets out the losses in full-time jobs and the full-time job gains in companies assisted by the enterprise development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA, in County Wicklow for the years 2002 to 2005. While these figures reflect the more difficult global market of the last few years, it remains the case that full-time employment in agency assisted companies in Wicklow is 12% higher in 2005 than it was a decade ago, increasing from 6,332 to 7,120 employed. In the broader local economy, the live register for County Wicklow shows a fall of 125 between December 2004 and December 2005, from 4,554 to 4,429.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The enterprise development agencies are committed to promoting Wicklow as a location for investment, as well as supporting and developing businesses already present in the county. IDA Ireland continues to work with its existing base of companies with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and the agency also targets potential new investment projects. For example, the European headquarters of Nabi, a biopharma company from the United States, was officially opened in April 2005 at the IDA business park in Bray and is expected to employ between 30 and 40 people by the end of this year. Enterprise Ireland activity, in terms of job creation, is focused on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies, the creation of new jobs by supporting entrepreneurs to set up high potential start-up companies and also through enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level by supporting research in companies and third level institutions. Since 2003, Enterprise Ireland has approved &euro;8.606 million and paid &euro;6.603 million to client companies in the county. During 2005 Wicklow CEB approved a total of &euro;263,773 to 23 projects and paid out more than &euro;494,000 in capital assistance throughout the region. In 2006, Wicklow CEB will continue to be actively involved in the county&rsquo;s economic and social development and will continue to be proactive in ensuring available funds are targeted to maximize entrepreneurial development throughout the locality. I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for County Wicklow.</P>

Because of the novelty of such right to Irish law and the directive&rsquo;s provision of options as to how several key aspects may be implemented, transposition by means of primary legislation rather than regulations under the European Communities Act is required. My Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, is preparing an intellectual property (miscellaneous provisions) Bill intended to transpose this and several other EU directives in the field of intellectual property.

	<P>State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland, which has responsibility for foreign direct investment and Enterprise Ireland, which is concentrating on the development of indigenous industries. The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey records jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the industrial development agencies. A total of 486 new jobs were created in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland in 2005, which is concentrating on the development of indigenous industries. My Department also provides funding to the Meath County Enterprise Board, which was established in October 1993 to provide support for small businesses with ten employees or fewer. The board assisted in the creation of 92 net jobs in the <Col N="495"/>county in the year ending 31 December 2005. Final figures for jobs created at county level for 2005 in respect of IDA client companies are not available from the IDA as yet. However, in the year to 31 December 2004, a total of 49 new jobs were created in companies supported by IDA Ireland, which has responsibility for foreign direct investment. I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies in Louth, together with the ongoing commitment and support of the county enterprise board for small business, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Meath.</P>

	<P>A company may not be registered, under the terms of the Companies Acts 1963 to 2005, with a name that is, in the opinion of the Registrar of Companies too similar to that of a company on the Register of Companies. When considering whether to allow a name for a new company, the words &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; are not <Col N="496"/>considered to be distinguishing words because all companies registered in the State are Irish and because of overuse of the words on the register. The words have become too generic. When the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; was removed in this case, the name left was too similar to that of another company on the register. Accordingly, it was refused. an appeal was lodged by the presenter&rsquo;s solicitor regarding this refusal on 11 January 2006. The reasons for the refusal have been explained to the solicitor and discussions on other proposed names are ongoing.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department recently received the draft text of regulations from the Health and Safety Authority, which are designed to transpose Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, as amended by Directive 2003/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. This is more generally known as the Seveso 2 directive. The new regulations will revoke and replace (i) the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000 (S.I. No. 476 of 2000), and (ii) the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) (Amendment) Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 402 of 2003). The regulations will apply to establishments where dangerous substances are present in amounts equal to or exceeding certain application thresholds. Operators of establishments will be required to take all necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of major accidents and to limit the consequences of accidents for people and the environment. The regulations will impose duties in respect of safety management systems, preparation of safety reports and emergency preparedness and they will also deal with provision of advice on major hazards in the context of land-use planning decisions. I expect the legal text of the regulations will be settled in the near future, which will enable me to sign the statutory instrument to bring the directive into force.</P>

	<P>Under my Department&rsquo;s refund of fees scheme, the costs of appropriate third level courses, which are pursued in officers&rsquo; own time, are refunded on successful completion of such courses. All staff are encouraged to participate in the scheme, as the pursuit of appropriate third level qualifications enhances their personal development and assists the Department to meet its business objectives more effectively. A total of 39 officers in my Department are pursuing third level courses under the scheme in the subject areas of business, accounting, management, public administration, industrial relations, law, IT and psychology. On successful completion of their studies, five officers will be awarded postgraduate qualifications, 24 will be awarded primary degrees, seven will be awarded diplomas and three will be awarded certificates. My Department also recognises that there is a need to form a cadre of officers who are qualified academically to address the future challenges it faces and, accordingly, strategically nominates officers to pursue appropriate post graduate courses as it sees fit. Three officers are pursuing postgraduate courses, the costs of which are being met in full by my Department. One officer was successful in the interdepartmental competition organised by the Department of Finance in 2005 to select candidates to participate in the 2005-07 masters programme in public policy analysis on a full-time basis. In accordance with the terms of the programme, this officer has been granted leave with pay to attend lectures during the 2005-06 academic year. The other two officers are pursuing, on a part-time basis, the doctorate in governance offered jointly by the Institute of Public Administration, Dublin, and Queen&rsquo;s University, <Col N="531"/>Belfast. In accordance with my Department&rsquo;s HR Strategy 2005-2007, every effort will be made to obtain the maximum return on investment in third level education by ensuring the best match, in the light of business needs of the Department, between the knowledge, skills and competencies of the staff member and their role in the Department.</P>

	<P>There was understandable upset at this tragic accident at Mulranny, County Mayo, where this young woman was killed in December 2004. I have replied to parliamentary questions on the accident and I have received a number of representations from the family concerned and from elected representatives. Following the accident, the Health and Safety Authority made inquiries and concluded that, although road works were ongoing on a stretch of the road, the work on the section where the accident took place had been completed, even to the extent that lines had been marked on the road. The authority wrote on 25 April 2005 to the family concerned and explained why it was not carrying out an investigation stating that the remit of the authority is confined to the investigation of occupational accidents and that the primary responsibility for investigating accidents which occur on public roads lies with the Garda.</P>
        <P>I am not aware that the family wishes to meet me but I understand that the chief executive officer of the HSA had a meeting with the family of the deceased on 1 December 2005. As a result of the meeting, and the provision of new information by the family, the authority carried out a review of the circumstances of the accident with a view to establishing whether health and safety legislation governed the circumstances surrounding the accident. In this regard, two senior inspectors were appointed by the authority to compile a report. The report is completed and, as a result, a full investigation by the authority is following in line with its remit. The chief executive officer of the authority has been in contact with the family directly regarding the findings of the review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 740 and 743 together.</P>
        <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Chemicals Agents) Regulations 2001 (S.I. No. 619 of 2001) deal with protecting workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work. The regulations serve to ensure a workplace using chemical agents must have an associated risk assessment performed, outlining the prevention and protection measures required to adequately protect the safety and health of those involved, where there is potential for exposure to occur. The regulations apply to all workplaces and work activities where there is a risk of exposure to a chemical used which may potentially have an adverse affect on workers. The associated Code of Practice for Chemical Agents, published by the Health and Safety Authority in 2002, sets out designated occupational exposure limit values, OELVs, for more than 700 chemicals, including an OELV for carbon monoxide at 20 ppm &mdash; 23 mg/m3 &mdash; as the value not to be exceeded over an eight hour reference period. The OELV for carbon monoxide is applicable to all work places and work activities where there is a risk of exposure to carbon monoxide while workers are at work, including at mink farms.</P>
        <P>Where a chemical is known to be used and where workers could potentially be exposed to that chemical, employers are required, under the chemical agents regulations, to perform a site specific risk assessment to ensure their workers are adequately protected against the risk of such exposures occurring, including the implementation of all necessary control measures to prevent exposure to that chemical. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Authority last carried out a series of routine inspections on a number of mink farms in 2002 and no major issues relating to workers&rsquo; safety were identified then. The authority received no complaints regarding worker safety, health or welfare on mink farms last year but if complaints are received in the future, they will be investigated.</P>

        <Quest>the Government policy on indefinite duration contracts; and <Col N="533"/>the measures which can be put in place to offer greater job security to persons who are employed under such contracts.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1375/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Government policy on indefinite duration contracts is dictated by the Protection of Employee (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. The Act provides that a fixed-term contract employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee in respect of conditions of employment including pay and pensions. To invoke the anti-discrimination provisions in the Act, the fixed-term employee must find a permanent comparator with (a) the same or associated employer (b) as specified in a collective agreement or (c) in the same sector or industry. In the case of (a) and (c), the fixed-term employee and the comparable permanent employee must perform the same or similar work or work of greater or equal value.</P>
        <P>The Act also provides that where a fixed-term employee whose contract of employment commenced before the commencement of the 2003 Act on 14 July 2003 completes or has completed three years of continuous employment with his or her employer or associated employer, the fixed-term contract may only be renewed once more by the employer for a period of no longer than one year and if it is renewed again after that it is deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration unless the employer has objective grounds for renewing the contract again on a fixed-term basis.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Act provides that , in the case of a fixed-term employee recruited after the enactment of the Act, if he or she is employed by his or her employer or associated employer on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts the aggregate duration of such contracts shall not exceed four years after which if the contract is renewed again it is deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration unless the employer has objective grounds for renewing the contract again on a fixed-term basis. Under the Act, a ground would be considered as an objective ground for treatment in a less favourable manner, including the renewal of a fixed-term employee&rsquo;s contract for a further fixed term, if it is based on considerations other than the status of the employee as a fixed-term employee and the less favourable treatment is for the purpose of achieving a legitimate objective of the employer and such treatment is necessary for that purpose. If a fixed-term employee feels that he or she is being treated less favourably as regards conditions of employment including pay and pensions than a permanent comparator or if he or she considers that he or she is entitled to a contract of indefinite duration and if his or her employer refuses to concede this, it is open to him or her to refer the matter to a rights commissioner for adjudication.</P>

        <Quest>the Government policy on agencies which receive State funding but do not accept decisions of the Rights Commissioners, the Labour Relation Commission or the Labour Court.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature. The State has established a number of institutions to assist in the resolution of trade disputes between employers and workers. These institutions are the Labour Relations Commission, the Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Court. The Labour Relations Commission&rsquo;s conciliation service is a voluntary mediation process. In this process, a professional mediator assists employers and their employees to resolve disputes when their efforts to do so have not succeeded. The process can be described as a facilitated search for agreement between parties in dispute. Where the process ends in continuing disagreement the parties have the option of referring the dispute to the Labour Court for a recommendation.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court conducts hearings on trade disputes and then issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled. In accordance with the voluntarist nature of the industrial relations machinery in this country, the Labour Court cannot compel a company to comply with its recommendations. As the Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to accept the outcome of the process namely the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
        <P>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended, provides legislative procedures for resolving disputes between trade unions and employers where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place. The Act and the associated enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution provide the parties with the opportunity to negotiate a settlement or to accept a recommendation of the Labour Court. If none of these procedures are successful in resolving the dispute, the Labour Court may be asked to issue a determination that can be enforced through the Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>Rights Commissioners investigate trade disputes referred by individuals or small groups of workers. Having carried out an investigation, a Rights Commissioner issues a recommendation, which is not binding on the parties involved, giving his or her opinion on the merits of the dispute. A party to a dispute under the Industrial Relations Acts may, however, appeal against a<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="535"/><?oasys _fc ?>Rights Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation to the Labour Court. The decision of the court on such appeals is binding on the parties to the dispute. Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969 provides a means whereby a case can be brought directly to the Labour Court without the case having been previously heard by a Rights Commissioner. To refer a case to the Labour Court under this section, however, the party or parties referring the case must agree in advance that they will accept the recommendation of the Labour Court. Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute. The law on industrial relations disputes does not generally seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but to assist them in arriving at a solution.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The tabular statement that follows sets out the inspections carried out by the Legal Metrology Service during 2005. Furthermore, the Legal Metrology Service has advised that, while a limited inspection regime is operated, a full programme of inspection of weighing equipment in meat processing plants will not be possible until an industrial relations issue relating to the conveyance of testing equipment is resolved. Negotiations with staff representatives on the utilisation of private haulage firms to convey heavy equipment to and from meat plants and provide assistance on site have, to date, been unsuccessful and the matter is awaiting hearing by the Labour Relations Commission. Full compliance with the Metrology Act 1996 throughout the sector can only be established when the industrial relations issue is resolved and a full inspection regime is resumed.</P><Col N="535"/>

	<P>The company in question announced through its corporate headquarters that it was rationalising its European operations and that this would require a reduction in job numbers of 300 across its facilities. Part of its manufacturing operation in Drogheda is being transferred to a sister facility in Holland. This will result in the loss of approximately ten permanent and 15 part-time jobs in Drogheda. While there was no consultation with IDA Ireland prior to the announcement, I am aware that last year, employment at the Drogheda facility increased from 70 people to almost 130 people, as a result <Col N="536"/>of an earlier rationalisation which saw the transfer of manufacturing activity from other European facilities into Drogheda. Staff numbers are expected to stabilise in Drogheda at approximately 100.</P>

        <Quest>the number of job losses and new jobs created by job creation agencies in County Louth by location in the county for each year since 2000; the amount invested in job creation; the amount of land zoned for employment by location in County Louth for each of these years; his plans to attract new employment to the county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Job creation and job losses are a feature of economic development in all countries as various sectors expand and contract <Col N="537"/>in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change. State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland, which has responsibility for foreign direct investment and Enterprise Ireland, which is concentrating on the development of indigenous industries. The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey records jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the industrial development agencies. Data are compiled on an annualised basis and are aggregated at county level only. Final data for 2005 will not be available until later this year. The following tables provide details for each year between 2000 and 2004 of the total funding approved and paid by each agency to companies in the county, the number of supported companies and total employment in these companies, job gains and losses in supported companies and, in the case of IDA Ireland, the total investment in property-related capital projects.</P>
        <P>While the IDA maintains a property portfolio to support and facilitate enterprise and job creation in the county, the zoning of land is a matter for the local authorities and not a matter in which the agencies have a function, other than in situations where, in furtherance of their statu<Col N="538"/>tory briefs, it would be appropriate for the agencies to make submissions or representations to the local authorities. Both agencies actively promote and encourage new investments and jobs for County Louth and also work with existing clients in the county with a view to helping them expand and or move their activities up the value chain. In addition to the activities of the development agencies, my Department also provides funding to the Louth County Enterprise Board, which was established in October 1993 to provide support for small businesses with ten employees or fewer. Between 2000 and 2005 the board paid out more than &euro;1.4 million in grant aid to 172 projects in County Louth, which has assisted in the creation of 504 jobs in the region. The board has also organised 128 training programmes over the same period in which 1,536 people participated. With the exception of the period 2000 to 2001, there has been an overall net increase in the number of jobs created by businesses assisted by Louth CEB. In 2005 there was a net increase of 220 jobs in CEB assisted companies in the county. I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies in Louth, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Louth. </P><Col N="537"/>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland and its regions. The Forf&aacute;s annual employment survey records jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the IDA. Data is compiled on an annualised basis and provisional data on a county basis for 2005 in respect of IDA client companies is not yet available from the agency.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2004, 22 IDA supported companies were operating in County Mayo, employing 3,213 persons. During 2004, 145 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies in the county and 400 jobs were lost in supported companies.

	<P>The issues of job creation and retention in Enterprise Ireland supported companies is a day-to-day matter for the agency itself, and not one in which I am directly involved.</P>
        <P>In 2005, a total of 122 Enterprise Ireland supported companies provided 3,054 full time jobs in County Mayo. During the year, Enterprise Ireland client companies in the county showed employment gains of 400 and losses of 143, resulting in a net change of 257. The net change of 257 shows a positive reversal of the trend in 2004 and 2003 which showed losses of 39 and 56, respectively. The table below shows the sectoral breakdown of these gains and losses. As part of its strategy to facilitate the creation and retention of jobs, Enterprise Ireland continues to works with companies in its portfolio in County Mayo to assist them in growing their sales and exports and improving innovation so they can compete on world markets.</P>

        <P>I have asked the Health and Safety Authority to develop proposals for a statutory instrument under the 2005 Act to give effect to this provision. I expect the authority, in line with its normal practice, to take into account all relevant matters relating to testing for intoxicants during the development of its proposals, which will include a public consultation process as provided for in section 57(2) of the 2005 Act. I look forward to receiving the authority&rsquo;s proposals in due course.</P>
        <P>In line with my undertaking to the House during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, I will also submit the proposed draft regulations on intoxicant testing in the workplace under the 2005 Act to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business for consideration.</P>

	<P>County and city enterprise boards, CEBs, assist enterprises in the micro-enterprise sector, that is, enterprises with no more than ten employees. The primary role of the CEBs is to develop indigenous enterprise potential by stimulating economic activity and promoting the establishment of micro-enterprises at local level.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The average cost per job created by the CEBs in 2004 stands at &euro;4,463 per job. In 2005, the average cost per job in CEB assisted enterprises stands at &euro;4,484. The value for money principle remains fundamental to the business approach taken by the CEBs. The cost per job created in 2004 and 2005 represents a highly economic cost to the State. The above calculations are based on a census of all surviving firms carried out at year end 2004 and 2005 and incorporate the total employment in such firms at that date.</P>

	<P>The issue of job creation by companies supported by the enterprise development agencies is a day-to-day matter for the relevant agencies, and not one in which I am directly involved. Average cost per job is calculated by taking into account all direct agency expenditure on Enterprise Ireland client companies. Only jobs created during, and sustained at the end of, each seven-year period are represented in the calculations.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the average cost per job created in companies with assistance from Enterprise Ireland in the period 1998-2004 was &euro;7,956. an average cost per job for the period 1999-2005 cannot be calculated until such time as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2005 financial statements are fully audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as required under section 22 of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998. Average cost per job for 2005 will be published in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s annual report, which is expected to be released by mid-2006.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread concerns in the Cork and Kerry areas arising from the operation of pyramid gifting progression schemes; the information available to him regarding the operation of such schemes; his views on whether the Pyramid Selling Act 1980 needs to <Col N="544"/>be updated; and his proposals in this regard.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware from media reports that a certain scheme or schemes, involving people &ldquo;gifting&rdquo; sums of money to other people in the expectation that they would receive multiples of the original sum involved, has been operating in the Cork and Kerry area. I understand the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in County Cork is investigating this scheme under the Pyramid Selling Act 1980. This legislation prohibits pyramid selling schemes and also prohibits the inducement of people to join such schemes. The Act applies to goods and services and there may be some doubt as to whether it applies to situations where no goods or services are involved. It is ultimately for the courts to decide whether an infringement has taken place.</P>
        <P>The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, 2005/29/EC, which was adopted in May 2005, increases protection for consumers across the EU by outlawing certain practices. One of the practices that will be outlawed is &ldquo;establishing, operating or promoting a pyramid promotional scheme where a consumer gives consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation that is derived primarily from the introduction of other consumers into the scheme rather than from the sale or consumption of products&rdquo;. A review of the law on pyramid selling will be undertaken in the context of the general ongoing review of consumer legislation and the transposition of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, 2005/29/EC.</P>
        <P>I urge people to be vigilant in how they use their money. They should reflect on whether it is realistic to expect other people to give them large sums of money for nothing. Everyone is free to spend their money as they wish but schemes that appear too good to be true are probably just that.</P>

	<P>In August 2004, my predecessor, Deputy Fahey, established a widely representative expert advisory group on workplace bullying, the terms of reference of which were to advise and report on the effectiveness of measures relating to the prevention of workplace bullying, the identification of improvements in procedures and how to address the contribution made by bullying to the incidence of workplace stress. On 17 August 2005, I launched the group&rsquo;s report, a copy of which is available free of charge on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.entemp.ie</i>. The principles laid down by the group in its report will underpin future consideration of the issue by the <Col N="546"/>Government, as anything less is not acceptable in a fair, safe and equitable workplace.</P>
        <P>Following publication of the report, I sought and obtained the views of the social partners on this matter. In addition, in September 2005, as part of the follow up consultation process, my Department, in the national newspapers and on my Department&rsquo;s website, sought the views of interested parties on how best the recommendations of the group might be implemented. Fifteen submissions were received.</P>
        <P>My Department is in the process of implementing one of the key recommendations of the expert advisory group which was to conduct a follow-up survey on workplace bullying which is similar to the survey conducted for the last report on this subject, published in 2001, in order to obtain an up-to-date picture of the incidence of workplace bullying. The tender process for the award of a contract to conduct the survey commenced last November but when an insufficient number of proposals was received, it was decided to extend the advertising process to the <i>EU Journal</i>. All the relevant documentation is available on the <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i> website. I expect the successful tenderer to start the survey in the second quarter of 2006 and to complete it within as short a timescale as possible. I intend to publish the results of the survey, hopefully by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>It is essential to have a complete and up-to-date picture of the incidence of the problem in workplaces before submitting proposals to Government for consideration, which I intend to do.</P>

	<P>The revised Civil Service policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace, A Positive Working Environment, which came into effect on 1 September 2005, is the basis for dealing with bullying issues in my Department. This policy, which was launched in October 2005, was circulated to all employees in November 2005. There have been no law cases dealt with or settled in my Department in regard to this issue since 1 January 2000 and there are no outstanding law cases.</P>

On 17 August 2005, the Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Killeen, launched the group&rsquo;s report, a copy of which is available free of charge on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.entemp.ie</i>. The principles laid down by the group in its report will underpin future consideration of the issue by the Government.</P>
        <P>The key recommendation of the expert advisory group is that legislation be brought forward to deal with workplace bullying. This legislation should apply to all employees in the workforce, irrespective of employment status. Following publication of the report, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, sought and obtained the views of the social partners and other interested parties on this matter.</P>

	<P>This Government is committed to addressing the needs of those with disabilities and, in particular, to removing the obstacles which make it difficult for people with disabilities to participate in the labour market. Community employment is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons, including those with a disability, with an opportunity to engage in work and training within their communities on a fixed-term basis. Experience has shown that CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking the cycle of unemployment through a return to work routine. It also assists in the enhancement and development of both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>In addition, CE enables the provision of a wide range of social and community services at local level which augment and support statutory <Col N="549"/>service arrangements. Optimum benefit is derived when CE schemes are aligned with services provided by the Department of Health and Children. I am informed that many CE participants go on to become qualified professional workers in selected employments such as child care and as personal care assistants.</P>
        <P>The ring fencing and prioritisation of places for health related services, child care and drugs task force clients is in place for the past five years. As a result, CE participation within these sectors has and continues to be maintained at a constant and supportive level.</P>

	<P>Employment data in respect of enterprise agency supported firms is collated by Forf&aacute;s on a calendar year basis, January to December, and accordingly no data is available in respect of 2006. During 2005, 609 full-time jobs were created in enterprise agency assisted firms while 474 were lost, giving a net gain of 135 jobs for the year. Permanent employment in agency assisted companies in County Mayo at the end of 2005 stands at 6,793. In addition, during 2005, Mayo County Enterprise Board, CEB, approved a total of &euro;437,965 to 23 projects and paid out &euro;301,239 in grant assistance which resulted in the creation of 53 net jobs in CEB assisted companies throughout the county.</P>

Furthermore, the most recent quarterly national household survey figures, for the third quarter of 2005, shows an unemployment rate for the west of 3.9%, which is significantly below the national average figure of 4.6%.</P>

Executives of IDA Ireland met parent company representatives on 12 January 2006 to discuss the restructuring which <Col N="552"/>is taking place within the company in question. The meeting confirmed the company&rsquo;s commitment to its operations in Arklow and Cherrywood, County Dublin, and to developing sales in the European market. I understand Arklow will be one of two processing centres of excellence for the company&rsquo;s business and is a key element of its future strategy. The Irish employees have been briefed on the company&rsquo;s future plans.</P>
        <P>The company in question has been paid grants amounting to &euro;1.1 million. These grants were paid subject to IDA Ireland&rsquo;s normal grant conditions and on the basis of 343 jobs being created. It is envisaged that the company will maintain a minimum of 350 jobs. Current employment stands at 372 in Arklow and 54 in Cherrywood. Consultations regarding the redundancies required by the company are ongoing between the company itself and its business focus forum, which comprises representatives of staff and management. These consultations are expected to conclude shortly.</P>

	<P>A range of financial supports and non-financial supports are provided to clients annually by the enterprise development agencies in support of various objectives such as improving competitiveness, improving client export capability, improving research and development and innovation, and improving employee skill levels, all of which combined result in stronger and healthier companies capable of retaining and increasing levels of employment as business grows. While agencies may provide direct grant assistance for the purpose of job creation, it should be noted that the assistance is generally part of a suite of supports which are mutually reinforcing.</P>
        <P>Figures for 2005, across the agencies, will only be available later in the year when accounts are finalised for 2005. However, the agencies have provided provisional figures for 2005. Enterprise Ireland reports that it approved &euro;85.5 million, including research and development and equity supports, in 2005 and made payments of circa &euro;68 million, including research and development and equity supports, to its client companies. The total funding approved in 2005 for employment grants amounted to &euro;4.5 million while &euro;3.3 million was paid directly to companies in the form of employment grants in this period. Employment grants reflect just one element of the comprehensive Enterprise Ireland business development offer.</P>
        <P>In 2005, IDA Ireland approved grants totalling &euro;173.4 million, which will give rise to payments being made over a number of years. I understand <Col N="553"/>provisional figures for IDA Ireland for 2005 show &euro;84.4 million was paid in grant-aid to client companies during the year. Of this amount, &euro;73.0 million was paid from the agency&rsquo;s Exchequer allocation and the balance of &euro;11.4 million from own resources. Shannon Development reports that &euro;6.9 million was approved and &euro;7.7 million paid in grants for its clients in 2005. Of this, &euro;263,000 was in respect of employment grant approvals and &euro;993,000 was paid in respect of employment grant.</P>
        <P>Initial statistics for 2005 indicate the 35 county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, approved &euro;12.5 million and paid &euro;10.8 million in grant assistance to 948 projects and contributed to the creation of an additional 1,897 full-time and 697 part-time jobs throughout the country. The total number currently employed in CEB assisted companies from the establishment of the boards in 1993 to 31 December 2005 now stands at 32,518 full-time and 9,240 part-time jobs. Provisional figures for 2005 indicate the CEBs approved employment grants to more than 280 projects nationally throughout the year.</P>

	<P>People on social welfare or Health Service Executive payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a medical condition, and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This scheme and related supplements are administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, and neither I nor my Department has any function in regard to individual claim decisions.</P>
        <P>The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet, low-cost or high-cost, has been prescribed by the applicant&rsquo;s medical adviser, as well as the income of the individual and his or her dependants. Diet supplement is not payable in cases where the total cost of the diet is less than or equal to one third of the person&rsquo;s income.</P>
        <P>The Dublin-mid-Leinster area of the Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned has been prescribed a low-cost diet, and applied to the executive for a diet supplement in October 2005. In accordance with the regulations governing the scheme, the amount of diet supplement payable in this case would be &euro;48.66, less one third of the applicant&rsquo;s income. On this basis, the person concerned did not qual<Col N="555"/>ify as one third of his income exceeds the cost of the diet.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 778, 779, 780, 785 and 793 together. My Department pays maternity benefit to women who have accumulated the required number of PRSI contributions on their social insurance record and who are on maternity leave from work. Entitlement to maternity benefit for employees is contingent on <Col N="556"/>entitlement to maternity leave, legislation for which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Budget 2006 brought forward a considerable improvement in the rate of payment for women in receipt of maternity benefit during 2006. With effect from 2 January of this year, and in accordance with commitments made by the Government during the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, the rate at which the level of maternity benefit is assessed as a proportion of reckonable earnings is increased from 75% to 80%. This measure will benefit most women in receipt of maternity benefit from that date onwards. Only those women who remain on the minimum payment rate will not gain from this measure, although they will still benefit from the &euro;17 increase in the minimum rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The weekly rate of maternity benefit is calculated by dividing the gross reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year by the number of weeks worked in that year, subject to a maximum of &euro;332.00 per week. Some 80% of reckonable earnings will be payable subject to a minimum payment of &euro;182.60 and a maximum rate of &euro;265.60. The minimum and maximum rate for 2005, based on 75% of reckonable earnings, stood at &euro;165.60 and &euro;249.00, respectively. This year&rsquo;s increase in the percentage level of reckonable earnings is projected to cost &euro;8.2 million during 2006 and will impact upon some 9,900 women.</P>
        <P>Budget 2006 also provided for core maternity leave &mdash; and, thus, maternity benefit payments &mdash; to be extended from 18 to 22 weeks. These additional four weeks of maternity leave will be effective from 1 March 2006, for all paid and unpaid leave commencing on or after that date. A further four weeks of unpaid maternity leave will also be available to all women who commence their paid or unpaid leave on or after 1 March 2006. Employees are legally required to give four weeks&rsquo; notice to the employer of the intention to take up their leave entitlement.</P>
        <P>Based on current averages of both the number of recipients and the rate of payment, the increase in the duration of maternity benefit will assist some 10,800 women each week. Some &euro;35 million has been allocated in budget 2006 for the implementation of this measure. Of this, &euro;27 million will come from the social insurance fund, reflecting the fact that women will be claiming maternity benefit for longer periods, and the remaining &euro;8 million will be met from the Exchequer to cover the expected payroll costs of public servants who do not pay the full PRSI contribution rate. The full-year cost of the 2006 extension will be &euro;42.5 million, of which &euro;32 million will be drawn from the social insurance fund.</P>
        <P>There will be a further four-week extension to both paid and unpaid maternity leave in 2007, bringing the total period of paid maternity leave to 26 weeks and that of unpaid maternity leave to 16 weeks. Taken together, the full-year cost of <Col N="557"/>the 2006 and 2007 extensions will be &euro;85 million, of which &euro;64 million will come from the social insurance fund. These extensions will be given effect in two separate pieces of legislation &mdash; the Social Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 2006 and by order of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the relevant provisions of existing maternity protection legislation, which is expected to be in place in February.</P>
        <P>The revised arrangements with regard to the duration of maternity leave and benefit will take effect from the earliest possible date, which is 1 March 2006, rather than 1 January. Those who commence their paid leave on or after 1 March 2006 will be entitled to the additional four weeks of paid leave. Furthermore, those who commence their unpaid leave on or after 1 March 2006 will be entitled to the additional four weeks of unpaid leave, even if they were not entitled to the extended paid leave period. Similar arrangements are being put in place to provide for payment of adoptive benefit for the increased duration of statutory adoptive leave.</P>
        <P>With any initiative of this nature, a specific introduction date means it is inevitable that a number of individuals will miss out on eligibility. This commencement date is driven by the need to make the necessary legislative and operational adjustments and the legal requirement for employers to receive the required statutory notification of maternity leave from employees. It is estimated that the cost of implementing the increased duration of maternity leave and consequent entitlement to maternity benefit from 1 January 2006 would have been in the region of &euro;6 million.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The old age, contributory, pension was first introduced in 1961 and social insurance contributions were increased at the time to reflect the additional coverage being provided under the social welfare system from then. The retirement pension was introduced in 1970. In general, all contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate on a person&rsquo;s record are assessed when their entitlement to a pension is being examined. However, while pre-1953 insurance contributions may be counted towards the basic number of paid contributions required, they may not be used to satisfy the average contributions test. Contributions made prior to 1953 are not fully recognised for pension purposes because such contributions were not made under the unified system of social insurance which became effective in 1953. The pre-1953 contributions are very differ<Col N="558"/>ent in nature to those made under the unified system and do not contain any provision for pensions.</P>
        <P>A special half-rate old age, contributory, pension was introduced in 2000 to enable people with pre-1953 insurance, who could not qualify for a payment under normal qualifying conditions, to receive a pension. People already qualifying for pensions at less than half rate could also benefit from the scheme. In order to be eligible for the payment, a person requires 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate, which can comprise a mixture of pre and post-1953 contributions.</P>

	<P>Unemployment benefit provides for periods of involuntary unemployment and is not payable in respect of any day during which a person is engaged in insurable employment or self-employment. In certain circumstances, however, a self-employed person may be entitled to claim unemployment benefit for part of a week. For example, if engaged under a contract for service, that is, self-employed, for up to three days per week, unemployment benefit may be payable for the remainder of the week provided that all qualifying conditions are satisfied.</P>
        <P>A person may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for up to nine weeks from the date of leaving employment if he or she has left the employment voluntarily and without just cause. To qualify for payment, a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work in respect of each declared day of unemployment. This means being prepared to accept any offers of suitable full-time employment immediately, having regard to the person&rsquo;s skills, qualifications, experience, and duration of unemployment. As there is an onus on the individual to show that this condition is satisfied on an ongoing basis, he or she would not qualify for payment of unemployment benefit while setting up a business or engaging in self-employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where a person is not eligible for unemployment benefit, arrangements are in place whereby a self-employed person, whose overall income falls below the rate of payment appropriate to his or her family size, can qualify for an unemployment assistance payment, which is means-tested. In assessing means, account is taken of net income that the person may reasonably expect to receive in the following year, after all expenses necessarily incurred are deducted.</P>

	<P>The school meals programme operated by my Department gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes. The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, currently operated by 36 local authorities. The Department jointly funds the food costs with these local authorities, who also manage and fund the administration of the scheme. The second is the school meals local projects scheme, through which funding is provided by my Department to participating schools and voluntary community groups in both urban and rural areas for specific school meals projects. This scheme also supports pre-schools that are community based and which operate on a not-for-profit basis.</P>
        <P>Under its programme of expenditure reviews, my Department completed a review of the school meals scheme in 2003. The review group recommended that a new scheme called the school food programme, SFP, should be established, targeting secondary schools with the highest concentrations of pupils at risk of early school-leaving and their feeder primary schools. Given the scale of this initiative, the group recommended the new programme should be phased in, in conjunction with the school meals project, targeting the most disadvantaged areas initially.</P>
        <P>In order to advance recommendations made in the review of the school meals scheme, my Department assigned additional staff in the Donegal area to pilot additional ways of encouraging schools and groups to participate in the scheme. This project has resulted in a total of 16 new schools becoming involved in the school meals local project scheme in Donegal. These schools, and schools already operating the programme, are enthusiastic about its benefits. Improved attendance, attention and behaviour are reported. This project has been extended into the Sligo and Leitrim areas in 2006. Options for extending this project into other areas are being examined.</P>
        <P>There is ongoing liaison between my Department and the Department of Education and Science on school meals issues. In 2005, the Department of Education and Science initiated a new action plan &mdash; delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, which incorporates many of that Department&rsquo;s existing schemes which tar<Col N="560"/>get educational disadvantage. an updated list of schools identified for inclusion in its school support programme will be available shortly. My Department will use this list to ensure disadvantaged schools are prioritised for inclusion in the school meals programme.</P>
        <P>While I am satisfied that the phased approach recommended in the 2003 report is proving effective, I have asked my Department to estimate as a matter of urgency how implementation on a wider basis can be accelerated. In 2004, expenditure on the school meals programme was &euro;4.65 million in total. In 2005, expenditure increased by more than 50% to &euro;8.24 million in total &mdash;&euro;7.08 million for the school projects and &euro;1.16 million for the urban school meals scheme. A total of &euro;9.1 million has been allocated for the school meals programme in 2006. I expect to see expenditure on school meals increase over future years as the school meals programme is greatly extended.</P>

	<P>The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity or gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes, is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. The package is also available to carers in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance and to people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for the household benefits package, the applicant must live alone or only with certain excepted people. A dependent child aged under 18, or under age 22 and in full-time education, is considered an excepted person. The person concerned applied for the household benefits package on 28 November 2005. The application was refused because his son, aged over 22, in full-time education, resides with the <Col N="561"/>applicant. The person concerned was in receipt of an increase in respect of a child dependant on his invalidity pension up to June 2003. This increase was stopped when his son ceased full-time education. If he returned to full-time education before his 22nd birthday, the person concerned may have an entitlement to an increase in respect of a child dependant until his son&rsquo;s 22nd birthday. My officials will be in touch with the person concerned shortly to establish his entitlement in this regard.</P>
        <P>Further extensions to the household benefits package could only be considered in a budgetary context and taking account of the financial and other needs of those not covered by the existing arrangements.</P>

	<P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.

	<P>The bereavement grant, which is a payment based on PRSI contributions, is designed to assist families in dealing with death <Col N="562"/>and funeral expenses. The grant is payable on the death of an insured person or a family member, including a child under age 18, or under age 22 if in full-time education. In the case of persons over these ages, the grant is paid on the basis of their own PRSI contributions. Where there are insufficient PRSI contributions a person may receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Under this arrangement, the HSE may make a single payment to help meet exceptional expenditure, for example, for funeral expenses, which a family could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their income.</P>

	<P>My Department operates a number of schemes which provide income support to those persons who are unfit to work due to illness or disability. These payments include disability benefit which is a social insurance based scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Facilitating return to work or participation in the active labour force is one of the main objectives of the social welfare system. There are a number of specific employment and training incentives available within the system to encourage and facilitate people with illness or disability to take up available work or training options. These include exemptions from the general &ldquo;no work&rdquo; conditions of the disability benefit and invalidity pension schemes to facilitate a person to undertake employment of a rehabilitative nature. These exemptions are granted, on the advice of the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors, usually for a period of 12 months, but may be renewed for a further period, subject to review, if a person seeks an extension. There are no immediate plans to extend the period of exemption but my Department is considering issues in relation to the type of employment allowed and also in relation to the income support arrangements for persons in these circumstances in light of a review of the illness and disability schemes which was under the expenditure review programme.</P>

	<P>My Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay, through the family income supplement scheme. A number of improvements have been made to the scheme over the years, including assessment of entitlement on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income thresholds, making it easier for lower income households to qualify for payment. As a result, there are currently over 17,488 families receiving a weekly FIS payment, reaching nearly 33,956 children. This is the highest number of FIS recipients in the history of the scheme.</P>
        <P>A lone parent can earn up to &euro;146.50 per week without affecting the lone parent&rsquo;s payment. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50% up to &euro;293 per week. When the lone parents earnings go above this limit, transitional arrangements allow for the payment of lone parent&rsquo;s allowance for a further six months. Budget 2006 provided for the upper earnings limit to be increased from &euro;293 per week to &euro;375 per week, effective from July 2006. This will cost &euro;5 million in 2006 and &euro;10 million in a full year. It should be noted that recipients of lone parent&rsquo;s allowance may still receive FIS while they are receiving their lone parent&rsquo;s allowance and that if their lone parent&rsquo;s allowance is reduced they may qualify for a higher rate of FIS.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Council was asked to examine the feasibility of merging of family income supplement and child dependant allowance into a second tier child income support. Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low income families without creating significant disincentives to employment. The NESC is currently considering its draft report which, when finalised, will be of significant assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.</P>
        <P>Payment of FIS through the tax system has been considered by a working group, including the social partners, the remit of which was to examine the role which refundable tax credits could play in the tax and welfare system. While the report of the group has not been finalised, it is expected that it will recommend that FIS continue to be paid by my Department, with a modified system of delivery and sustained efforts to improve take up.</P>
        <P>In a determined effort to increase awareness of the FIS support and to improve take-up levels, my Department is currently preparing an awareness campaign that will be launched in the near future and which will include media and promotion initiative at national and regional level.</P>

	<P>Social protection of the population in general is provided through a combination of insurance-based payments and assistance payments targeted at need. The purpose of the means test is to ensure that, for those who do not have social insurance cover or who have insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for benefit, resources are targeted most effectively. The weekly rate of means-tested social welfare payments must, under legislation, be reduced by the amount of any weekly means assessed. The main items counted as means include cash income which the claimant or his-her spouse or partner may have, the value of savings, investments, shares, land etc., or any property other than the claimant&rsquo;s home. Capital owned by a recipient of a social assistance payment is assessed in the normal way, with a disregard of the first &euro;20,000 of the amount held.</P>
        <P>In the case of inheritance, some persons making a will give consideration to the creation of a discretionary trust for people with a disability and this has somewhat different implications for the assessment of means. A discretionary trust may be created by deed during a parent&rsquo;s, or other relative&rsquo;s, lifetime when perhaps a lump sum or windfall is to be invested or it can be established in a will along with the naming of trustees. Funds within a discretionary trust are administered at the discretion of the trustees and whether they are assessable as means will depend on how they are administered.</P>
        <P>Where a discretionary trust fund is set up for a recipient of social welfare means-tested payment, a life interest in such a fund would mean that any cash income that she or he may reasonably be expected to receive from it during a particular year is assessable as means. Accordingly, periodic payments received from the fund are regarded as cash income and assessed as means. However, funds used to purchase items of capital expenditure or services on behalf of the beneficiary do not constitute means, for example, money spent on renovating the house in which the claimant resides, the purchase of a car or holiday or assistive technology. Similarly, occasional sums withdrawn or received by the claimant for particular purposes are not normally regarded as cash <Col N="565"/>income for means purposes. Transfers of capital to the beneficiary are assessable as capital. Unspent balances held by the claimant, for example, in the claimant&rsquo;s own bank account, are assessable under the rules governing capital. On secondary benefits, the free travel pass and any other extra benefit entitlements will remain with the person as long as they are in receipt of the relevant social welfare payment, whether at full or reduced rate.</P>

	<P>Family Income Supplement, FIS, is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments. FIS is paid on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks, taking into account a family&rsquo;s net earnings and the number of children under aged 18 or aged between 18 and 22 years and in full time education.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2006, FIS income thresholds were increased by a range of earnings limits, from &euro;19 per week for a one child family to &euro;282 per week for an eight child family. This represents a net <Col N="567"/>increase of between &euro;11.40 per week for a one child family to &euro;169.20 per week for an eight child family, effective from January 2006. A table showing the increases in FIS thresholds from 2005 to 2006 is provided.</P>
        <P>Since 2002, FIS thresholds for a one child family have increased by &euro;103 or 28.5%, while thresholds for an eight child family have increased by &euro;366 or 67.9%, providing significant increases to all families while concentrating additional resources on larger families and ensuring that households in poverty are targeted. The estimated cost of the improvement in FIS thresholds is &euro;25 million in a full year. The number of families receiving FIS payments at the end of December 2005 was 17,488 in respect of 33,956 children, the highest in the history of the scheme. This represents an increase of approximately 45% in the past three years.</P>
        <P>In a sustained effort to further increase take-up of FIS, my Department is currently preparing an awareness campaign that will include media and promotion initiatives at national and regional level. </P>

        <Quest>if consideration was given in the preparation of budget 2006 to the extension of half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance to persons who are undertaking full time caring responsibilities but who are in receipt of a social welfare pension; if estimated costings for the proposal were developed by his Department; and the priority which will be given by his officials to the desirability of such a change.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1459/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a <Col N="568"/>general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one person. Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition. This arrangement was introduced to acknowledge the needs of carers especially in regard to respite. In the recent budget, provision was made to increase the amount of the respite care grant from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200 from June 2006.</P>
        <P>According to census 2002, there are more than 48,000 people providing personal care for over four hours per day. More than 25,800 of these are in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit. It is likely that a proportion of the balance is in receipt of a different social welfare payment, for example an old age pension. It is not possible to estimate the number of people who are in this situation and it is therefore not possible to estimate the cost of the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
        <P>In addition to the increase in the level of the respite care grant, I also announced a significant increase in the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance. From the beginning of this month, the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance increased to &euro;200 per week for carers age 66 years and over. This rate of payment may be higher in many instances than the rate of old age pension or widow or widower&rsquo;s pension payable to a person. Such a person who is providing full time care and attention to a person who requires such care may be entitled to receive this higher rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>I would strongly urge a person in this position to make inquiries with my Department. I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. Those recommendations involving additional expenditure can only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>Up to 2005, the respite care grant was payable to persons who were in receipt of either the carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit payments on the date that the grant was payable, the first Thursday of June. Section 7 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005 amended the scheme, by increasing the amount of the grant to &euro;1,000 and by extending entitlement to the grant, subject to certain employment-related conditions, to all persons providing full-time care and attention to a person requiring such care. Section 7 also conferred powers to make regulations detailing requirements for entitlement to the grant.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>The relevant regulations, the Social Welfare (Consolidated Payments Provisions) (Amendment) (No. 3) (Respite Care Grant) Regulations 2005, SI 231 of 2005, were promulgated on 29 April 2006, and they provide for such matters as the date on which the grant is payable; the period for which the carer must provide full-time care and attention to the care recipient; certain circumstances in which a carer is to be regarded as continuing to provide the full-time <Col N="570"/>care and attention; the conditions to be satisfied by a carer who is not residing with the care recipient, as provided for in section 196A(1)<i>(e)</i> as quoted by the Deputy; the conditions under which a person may engage in employment or self-employment but continue to be regarded as providing full-time care and attention; certain requirements as to the medical certification of the care recipient; and the time limit for application.</P>
        <P>Further improvements to the respite care grant scheme were announced in Budget 2006. These include a further increase of &euro;200, bringing the amount of the grant to &euro;1,200, in addition to provision to increase, from ten to 15, the number of hours which a carer may engage in employment or self-employment and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention to the person requiring care. The necessary primary legislation will be brought forward during the current parliamentary session.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for carer&rsquo;s allowance on 8 July 2005. Following the necessary investigations her application was refused on 12 September 2005 on the grounds that her means exceed the statutory limit for receipt of this allowance.</P>
        <P>Under social welfare legislation, the capital value of property owned but not personally used or enjoyed, where it is rented to a third party, is assessed as means in accordance with a formula set out in legislation. The fact that the property let in this case was previously the home of the person concerned is not relevant in the means <Col N="573"/>test. Such a property cannot be disregarded as your own home in cases where that property is let. Property must be capable of being sold, let or put to profitable use before a capital value assessment is applied. In the case of property that is let, the amount assessed as means is the notional assessment provided for in legislation, not the rental income. The income assessed as means in this case consists of &euro;1,090 per week derived from capital held and the capital value of property not personally used and enjoyed. Following the application of the &euro;270 income disregard, that applies, her weekly means equate to a net &euro;820. She was notified of this decision, the reasons for it and of her right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. She appealed this decision on 19 September 2005. Her file has been submitted to the social welfare appeals officer for determination.</P>
        <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I received the report of the Pensions Board on the national pensions review in <Col N="574"/>November 2005 and the report was published on 17 January. The report is a comprehensive assessment of the progress we have made in regard to our overall pensions strategy, the appropriateness of the coverage and other targets which were suggested in the national pensions policy initiative and which have underpinned pensions policy for the last seven years, and the future changes in the structure of our population together with the additional pension costs which will arise as a result of these changes. The report also draws on experience in other countries and assesses a number of alternative models which could be adopted in pursuit of our overall pension goals.</P>
        <P>The key messages emerging from the report are that, in the future, pensions costs which will be much higher than previously thought, will be costly for all concerned including Government, employers and employees no matter how financed; supplementary pension provision remains inadequate and is unlikely to improve without changes to the present system; and there are also concerns in regard to the adequacy of pension provision.</P>
        <P>The Pensions Board has put forward suggestions for improvements in regard to the existing voluntary pension system. In particular, they have suggested a restructuring of the system of tax relief for personal retirement savings accounts to capture the elements of the SSIA system which made that so attractive to the public. I am discussing the costs and practicalities of implementing these suggestions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the measures suggested by the Pensions Board may well result in improvements in the current situation. However, we must be prepared to consider more radical solutions and, in this regard, I will be asking the Pensions Board to carry out further work in some areas. In particular, I will be asking the board to build on the excellent work it has done in the context of the report in the area of mandatory pensions with a view to designing and costing a suitable model for Irish circumstances.</P>
        <P>The contents of this report pose many questions for Irish society, including the manner and the extent to which we are prepared to make provision for retirement. I hope that the publication of the report will engender a national debate on these issues that will assist in arriving at a solution which will be effective in securing the future of people in retirement and which will command wide acceptance. In this regard I intend, in the near future, to convene a national conference to consider the report and to debate the issues which have been highlighted.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the relevant eligibility conditions.</P>
        <P>Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. In cases of extreme or terminal illness my Department has specific arrangements in place to ensure that such applications are processed as quickly and sensitively as possible so that payment can be put into place at the earliest possible juncture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made. In addition to the work my Department has to carry out, there is an onus also on applicants to furnish all necessary documentation. Time can elapse through delays by persons applying for the allowance in supplying all the necessary information in support of their claim. The average time for deciding an application for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance is currently 7.5 weeks, although in many cases they are processed within a far shorter timeframe. Many applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. Such payments normally continue until entitlement to their carer&rsquo;s allowance is determined.</P>
        <P>In the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance, the Department&rsquo;s performance target is to award 70% of claims within nine weeks. This target has been met in two of the last three months, the exception being December when 65% of claims were decided within nine weeks.</P>
        <P>The staff and other resources available to my Department are deployed to ensure good customer service, to prevent fraud and abuse of the schemes and to achieve value for money. The situation is reviewed on a regular basis. I am satisfied that the resources assigned to the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme are adequate to meet the demands of the service.</P>

	<P>There are currently 25,077 persons receiving carer&rsquo;s allowance. This is the highest total since the scheme was introduced. My Department received 8,846 applications for carer&rsquo;s allowance in 2005. A total of 8,793 were decided, of which 5,066 applications were awarded and another 960 were withdrawn. The number of persons who had their initial application for the allowance refused was 2,767.</P>
        <P>Following the submission of additional medical information or other relevant information to my Department, a number of these applications were subsequently reviewed. Some 792 refusals were either revised in favour of the applicant or awarded on appeal. As a result, the number of persons who were refused the allowance was 1,975. Accordingly, the rate of refusal for the allowance is 22% of all applications that were received in 2005.</P>
        <P>The reasons these 1,975 did not qualify for the allowance are as follows. Some 966 applications were refused as the care was deemed to be not in need of full-time care and attention; 199 applications were refused as means were in excess of the weekly limit; 106 applications were refused as the carer was employed in excess of ten hours per week; 193 applications were refused as full-time care and attention was not being provided; and 58 applications were refused as the habitual residence condition was not satisfied. The remaining 453 claims were refused for other reasons. All persons who apply for carers allowance are informed regarding any decision on their entitlement and the reasons for it. In addition, where a person is refused the allowance he or she is advised of a right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>Support for and recognition of carers is a continuing priority for Government. Payments to carers have been improved and qualifying conditions for carers allowance have been significantly eased. Coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as the respite care grant have been introduced and enhanced. The further development of support for carers continues to be a priority for me and for Government as reflected in the various budget enhancements I am providing for in 2006.</P>

When he made his application he stated that his employment had termin<Col N="577"/>ated due to lack of work. On 9 September 2003, the employer was requested to confirm this. On 20 February 2004, the employer replied to the query stating that the person concerned was on a career break. A deciding officer, therefore, disallowed the unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned for the period 9 September 2003 to 18 February 2004 as he was not available for work.

        <Quest>the way in which his Department determines the irregular income of artists and musicians in assessing entitlement to social welfare payments.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the assessment of means of a person who has an irregular income for the purposes of claiming unemployment assistance. In applying the legislation, deciding officers do not treat artists or musicians any differently to any other unemployment benefit or assistance claimant.</P>
        <P>Unemployment assistance is a means tested payment. Assessment of means includes any cash income, the value of any saving or investments, property other than the person&rsquo;s home and any other maintenance received by the claimant. The income of a claimant with no dependants and who is casually employed is assessed as follows. A disregard of &euro;12.70 is deducted for each day worked and 60% of the balance is assessed as means. If the claimant has a spouse-partner who works up to three days each week a disregard of &euro;38.09 applies when assessing the claimant&rsquo;s means. If the spouse-partner works four days or more per week, a disregard of &euro;88.88 applies. A full qualified adult allowance is payable where the spouse-partner earns up to &euro;88.88 per week and a reduced qualified adult allowance is payable where the spouse earns between &euro;88.89 and &euro;239.99 per week. No qualified adult allowance is payable where the weekly earnings of the spouse-partner are in excess of &euro;240.</P>
        <P>Where a person claims unemployment assistance and continues to be engaged in self-employment, the deciding officer, in the absence of any other means of ascertaining it, will assess the net income received in the past year. Income from irregular-self employment may vary from week to week and the current arrangements of assessing the income over a full year avoids the necessity to continuously recalculate a person&rsquo;s means. I am satisfied that this arrangement is a fair and <Col N="578"/>reasonable method of estimating income from irregular-self employment for the purposes of unemployment assistance. However, if there is a change in the person&rsquo;s position which is likely to have an ongoing effect on the amount earned from self employment, this matter should be brought to the attention of the deciding officer or, alternatively, if the person is already in receipt of unemployment assistance, a review of means should be sought. I would also like to point out that a person may appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office if he or she is dissatisfied with any decision of a deciding officer.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Civil Service policy dealing with bullying, harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace &mdash; A Positive Working Environment &mdash; was introduced across the Civil Service in July 2000. A copy of the policy was distributed to all staff in my Department. The policy was reviewed last year to take account of subsequent developments at national and EU level and also to take on board the experience gained in the operation of the original policy. A revised policy came into effect from 1 September 2005, which is designed to ensure compliance with codes of practice issued under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005; the Industrial Relations Act 1990 and the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A copy of the revised policy was issued to all staff in my Department, along with an information leaflet. The policy document is also available electronically on internal shared computer systems. Information on the revised policy is given to all new staff at entry to the Department and information and advice in regard to dealing with allegations of bullying are given on departmental management training courses.</P>
        <P>There are three outstanding law cases taken by employees of this Department in regard to allegations of bullying. One case has been settled since 1 January 2000. Legislation in the area of employment law is not the responsibility of this Department. Policies for the Civil Service in regard to bullying are issued centrally through the Department of Finance. My Department is committed to the implementation of these policies and procedures, which are aimed at ensuring that the work environment is free from bullying and harassment and that any cases of complaint, which arise, are investigated as appropriate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards. Recommendations in regard to awards <Col N="580"/>are made by the Secretary General of each Department and the operation of the scheme is overseen by the Committee for Performance Awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals.</P>
        <P>Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, available on the website <i>www.finance.gov.ie.</i> The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.</P>
        <P>Submissions in respect of the year ending 31 December 2005 have been forwarded to the committee for its consideration. In addition, there is a scheme for recognition of exceptional performance by staff which operates across the Civil Service. This scheme has been in operation since 1996 and allows secretaries general to make awards for sustained exceptional performance to staff. Awards may be made in respect of performance above the level which would reasonably be expected in the normal course from the grade of staff involved. All staff in the Department, irrespective of grade, can nominate another staff member or a team for an award, at any time during the year.</P>
        <P>The total expenditure on the scheme, which in my Department is called the Fi&uacute;ntas scheme, may not exceed 0.2% of payroll costs.

	<P>My Department assists and encourages long-term unemployed, and other welfare recipients to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures administered by my Department&rsquo;s social and family support service. In addition, my Department&rsquo;s locally based facilitators operate the technical assistance and training grants, TATS, and special projects fund to provide enhanced support to people who need additional help to progress to further training and employment.</P>
        <P>The technical assistance and training grants fund was originally established for self-employed participants in the back to work allowance scheme to provide them with training in the areas <Col N="582"/>of start your own business, book-keeping-accounts, preparation of business plans, marketing, literacy and computer training and assistance with the purchase of small items of equipment. It also provides assistance with the cost of HGV training and licence to individuals where appropriate. Since 2003, the fund has been extended to support other welfare customers. In 2005, over 4,000 grants were provided at a cost of &euro;1.879 million. The amount allocated for 2006 is &euro;2.55 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department&rsquo;s special projects fund also enables facilitators to assist more marginalised groups and demonstrates the positive results of a partnership approach between my Department, the voluntary and community sector and other local players in identifying and addressing local needs in terms of training and development. Some of the projects supported include personal development, computer training, literacy-numeracy and life skills. HGV driving lessons for welfare recipients may also be supported from this fund. In 2005, a total of 198 special projects were funded, co-funded or part-funded at a cost of &euro;2.8 million. The budget for 2006 is &euro;2.5 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The qualifying conditions for contributory old age pensions require a person to have paid at least 260 contributions at the appropriate rate, enter insurance ten years before pension age and achieve a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record from 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the date of entry into insurance, if later. an average of 48 contributions is required to qualify for a pension at the maximum rate.</P>
        <P>The special half-rate pension for self-employed people was one of a number of measures which was introduced by the Government to provide a basic payment for groups who would not otherwise qualify for a social welfare pension. In this case, the measure was designed to benefit self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory self employed social insurance was introduced in 1988 and who could not therefore satisfy the condition of having entered insurance ten years before pension age. This particular group also had the option of receiving a refund of a portion of their social insurance contributions.</P>
        <P>The special pension, which is based on five years contributions, is payable at 50% of the standard rate and, as already indicated, its objective was to provide a basic payment to people who <Col N="584"/>would not otherwise qualify for a pension. A similar arrangement was provided to cater for people with pre-1953 social insurance. This special pension was seen as a reasonable response to the position of the self-employed and represents good value for the contributions made. There are no proposals to enhance the payment on the lines suggested.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>An increase in workforce participation of older people is one of the more important means of ensuring the sustainability of pensions systems in the future and has been recognised as such internationally.</P>
        <P>It is important that we encourage and facilitate people who would like to continue to work beyond normal retirement age. The Government is already committed to removing the retirement condition associated with the retirement pension so that people will not have to leave work before qualifying for a pension. In budget 2006, I announced the introduction of an earnings disregard for recipients of non-contributory pensions, which will lessen the impact of working on these pensions. The Pensions Board in its report on the national pensions review has recommended further measures in the social welfare context and I will be considering the costs and practicality of introducing the suggested changes.</P>
        <P>However, issues surrounding social welfare payments represent only one aspect of the problem. As I indicated at the publication of the national pensions review, we require a change in attitudes in relation to longer working from both employers and employees. Employers must seek to retain older employees and create the conditions which will make longer working both attractive and feasible for older workers. The creation of an entitlement for people to work beyond normal retirement ages would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

	<P>The back to education allowance is a <Col N="585"/>second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>At present, to qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme an applicant must be at least 21 years of age &mdash; 18 years of age for people with disabilities. Lone parents and others may access the scheme at 18 years of age if they are out of formal education for two years or more. an applicant must also be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or 12 months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications. The 12 month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the national employment action plan.</P>
        <P>The eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme are considered reasonable and necessary in order to ensure that resources are targeted at those who are most in need, bearing in mind that the objective of the scheme is to assist people who have been claiming a social welfare payment on a long-term basis.</P>
        <P>As part of my social policy reform measures, I have identified increased opportunities for lone parents as a priority. In this context, obstacles to lone parents returning to employment, training or education are being closely examined and access to the back to education allowance will form part of this assessment.</P>

	<P>The current minimum funding standard, which applies to defined benefit, DB, occupational pension schemes under the Pensions Act 1990, is a wind-up standard. It is designed to ensure that, if a funded DB scheme winds up, there are sufficient assets to meet the liabilities at that point in time.</P>
        <P>However, that is only one aspect of the overall funding standard regime. Provisions which are in place provide a mechanism to enable under-funded schemes to return to full funding within a defined period and in a planned and managed way whether the shortfall relates to the asset or liability side of the fund. These provisions were recommended in a review of the funding standard by the Pensions Board, completed in December 2004, and implemented via the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005.</P>
        <P>At the end of the day there is no magic formula to address these issues. I believe the current regime achieves the required balance between member protection and encouraging continued pension provision. However, I am aware concerns continue to be expressed and I will be asking the Pensions Board to review the situation.</P>

	<P>In 2004 just over 52% of those at work had a supplementary pension. This figure falls to about 23% for those aged 20 to 24. Coverage figures for those aged 25 to 34 is approaching the overall average at just over 50% while those in the age bracket of 35 to 44 have a coverage rate of over 62%.</P>
        <P>Clearly, coverage among younger workers is a problem and the Pensions Board has sought to target this particular group through its pensions awareness activities. The reasons people do not contribute to pension schemes are many and varied. People may have other priorities in their earlier years, such as house purchase, but there may also be a degree of complacency involved with savings for retirement being well down their list of priorities. The long-term nature of pensions <Col N="587"/>savings and the lack of access to these funds have also been cited as disincentives to participation.</P>

	<P>The bodies and agencies under the aegis of my Department that are subject to Freedom of Information legislation, in respect of certain functions only, are Comhairle and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman. The nature of the exemptions is as follows: For Comhairle, exemption from disclosure, without the consent of the Comhairle board, of confidential information obtained by staff, a committee member or an adviser or consultant to the Comhairle board in the course of their duties; and for the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman, exemption from disclosure, without the consent of the Pensions Ombudsman, of information obtained by employees, advisers or consultants to the Pensions Ombudsman while performing or having performed their duties.</P>
        <P>It is intended to make arrangements for these non-disclosure provisions to be overridden by freedom of information. This will require amendments to the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003. Following the amendments, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman will be subject to the freedom of information legislation on the same limited basis as applies to any other ombudsman, that is, freedom of information will not apply to a record relating to an examination or investigation carried out by an ombudsman.</P>

	<P>The question of the adoption of changes in the circumstances where the driver of a vehicle can be made the subject of a preliminary roadside breath test <Col N="588"/>has been the subject of considerable debate and consideration for some time.</P>
        <P>The current road safety strategy recommends that the introduction of random breath testing should be pursued within its operational time frame of 2004 to 2006. Against that background my Department is examining the development of a scheme for a more general basis for roadside testing in close consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>I met the chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and all the party spokespersons for a discussion focused solely on this issue late last year at which I outlined the legal concerns as I understand them. I am endeavouring to find an approach to this issue which crosses party boundaries. In the meantime, the garda&iacute; are empowered to require that all drivers involved in road collisions or detected committing any traffic offences must submit to roadside breath tests. This is in addition to the limiting power to demand that a driver who in the opinion of a garda has consumed alcohol must submit to such a test.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Land leases at Dublin Port are an operational matter for the port company concerned. Dublin Port Company has expressed a view to the Department that the application of the provisions of the Landlord and Tenants Acts to the port companies operating under the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000 is not appropriate to the management of the port estates. The Maritime Safety Act 2005 added the port companies referred to above, to the list of State bodies to which the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 does not apply. This Act provides <i>inter alia</i> for a general right to acquire the fee simple.</P>
        <P>The Ports Policy Statement published in January 2005 states that the Department acknowledges the view of port companies that the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts impose restrictions on their ability to effectively facilitate the development within their ports of an efficient and competitive market for port services, including new entrants. The Ports Policy Statement indicates that, as recommended by the High Level Review of the State Commercial Ports published in May 2003, the Department intends to give consideration, in the context of future legislative changes, to the possible adaptation of the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts to the particular circumstances of the ports.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 830 and 867 together.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources launched the Government&rsquo;s Ports Policy Statement. The policy statement aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs. One of the key challenges that lies ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade. The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner.</P>
        <P>As an initial step in this process, the Department consulted with the commercial ports handling unitised trade, to determine their view of port capacity and how they intended to deal with the projected capacity requirement. The following ports on the east coast responded in this regard with information on their project proposals: Drogheda, Greenore, Dublin and Rosslare. Drogheda Port provided information on its proposal to develop a new port at Bremore.</P>
        <P>In addition, in September 2005, the Department appointed Fisher Associates to<i> inter alia </i>advise on evaluating the projects submitted by the commercial ports. The purpose of this process is to satisfy the Minister for Transport and the Government in due course that the anticipated capacity requirement to 2014 and beyond can be efficiently and adequately met.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Ports Policy Statement was launched on 6 January 2005. In the chapter on integrated transport policy, the policy statement <Col N="590"/>highlights the substantial role of the commercial ports as part of the overall transport network and their reliance on landside transport connectivity. In this context the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources asked the ports to co-ordinate a view on their landside access priorities.</P>
        <P>In this context, Drogheda Port Company made a submission in April 2005 to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources concerning <i>inter alia</i> the Drogheda Northern Cross Route. This information was forwarded to both the Departments of Transport and Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Department of Transport forwarded this information to the National Roads Authority and in response the NRA submitted to that Department an update report regarding <i>inter alia </i>the Northern Cross Route. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provided the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with an update as to the status and financing in relation to <i>inter alia</i> the Northern Cross route. In October 2005, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources forwarded both of the update reports referred to above to Drogheda Port Company.</P>
        <P>In addition, I understand that the Drogheda Northern Cross Route was among a number of matters discussed at a meeting between the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Drogheda Port Company in December 2005.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 empower local authorities, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association, to grant a disabled person&rsquo;s parking permit where they are satisfied that the applicant is suffering from a disability that prevents him or her from walking or causes undue hardship to the person in walking. It is a matter for each of the issuing organisations to determine whether a disabled person&rsquo;s parking permit should be granted based on each application submitted to it.</P>
        <P>The qualifying criterion centres on the issue of the mobility impairment of the applicant and no specific medical condition is stipulated in the regulations. I am of the view that the current scheme, based on the personal mobility of the applicant, represents the optimum approach for the issue of these particular parking permits.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently engaged in a consultation process with groups representing the interests of disabled persons, who are engaged in the issue of the disabled person&rsquo;s parking permits, the garda&iacute;, local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in relation to the regulatory provisions made under the Road Traffic Acts that relate to the operation of disabled person&rsquo;s parking permits and the use of disabled person&rsquo;s parking bays.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no delay in the conclusion of the negotiations between the EU and US on a new aviation agreement. The full text of an agreement was settled by EU and US officials at the end of their last <Col N="594"/>negotiation session in Washington, on 18 November 2005. The only significant outstanding issue is the outcome of the US&rsquo;s moves to amend its ownership and control rules in order that EU carriers, for example, could have much greater control over the commercial activities of US airlines that they invest in. The US began its public consultation process at the beginning of November 2005, and its own procedures for this means that it cannot publish the result of the process until about March 2006. This timescale may not be sufficient to allow for a final decision at the March Transport Council, but a final decision will, I expect, be taken no later than the June Transport Council, with a view to the EU-US Aviation Agreement coming into effect in November 2006. The time scales for all of the above mentioned staging posts along the way to the EU-US Agreement have been known to the US and to EU Ministers from November 2005, and they are all proceeding on schedule. As I have said in the House many times before, the conclusion that open skies will be good for Irish <Col N="595"/>tourism, aviation, business links and the economy generally is clear.</P>
        <P>The transitional arrangement for Shannon has now been finalised, and the period of time for Shannon to prepare is now known. It is now a matter for the management and staff of Shannon Airport to use that transitional period in the best way possible, and to look forwards and grasp the undoubted opportunities that open skies offers.</P>
        <P>In addition to the extra time that the transitional period allows Shannon, I also announced my intention to develop a tourism and economic development plan for Shannon Airport, in consultation with my colleagues, the Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, following the negotiation in November 2005 of the transitional arrangement for Shannon Airport. Work has begun in my Department on that plan. I am consulting both Ministers concerned on the scope of the plan and the structures to manage the development and implementation of the plan given the cross-departmental nature of the issues involved.</P>
        <P>I also met with a group from the Mid-West Regional Authority, which also included representatives from SIGNAL, Shannon Development, IBEC, Shannon Airport and local authorities. A further meeting of that group was also recently attended by a senior official of my Department in order that the group can liaise with my Department regarding the cross-departmental work under way, and have a means to input suggestions or material of their own.</P>

	<P>Arrangements for the recruitment of driver testers are principally the responsibility of the Public Appointments Service. As part of the recruitment process candidates for the position of driver tester are obliged to undertake a psychometric test, undergo a practical driving test and interview which assesses their suitability for the position. The driving test in Ireland is designed in accordance with the requirements of the European Directive 91/439/EEC on driving licences, which sets out the skills a driver must demonstrate during a driving test.</P>
        <P>Following recruitment each driver tester undergoes a six week training course which covers all aspects of the driving test. The work of driver testers is monitored on an ongoing basis by supervisory driver testers to ensure that a uniform standard of test is maintained. There are procedures in place to ensure that further training is provided if difficulties in applying this standard are identified.</P>
        <P>All driver testers underwent a comprehensive two week refresher training programme in 2002 which covered procedures for carrying out driving tests, guidelines for assessing driving faults and training to enhance customer service in the delivery of the driving test. The training course <Col N="597"/>undertaken by recruit driver testers is currently under review.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislative basis for the application of speed limits on roads generally is set out in the Road Traffic Act 2004 and came into operation on 20 January 2005. That Act establishes a range of speed limits that apply to particular classes of road on a default basis and also provides the basis for county councils and city councils to apply special speed limits in lieu of these default speed limits. The power to apply special speed limits is given under section 9 of the Act to the elected members of county and city councils acting following consultation with the Garda, the written consent of the National Roads Authority in respect of proposals for national roads and motorways and a public consultation process. The range of speed limit values that can be applied as special speed limits is set in that section.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the 2004 Act also provides that the Minister for Transport may issue guidelines to county and city councils in relation to the application of special speed limit by-laws. I issued such guidelines on 18 April 2005 to the county and city managers. Special speed limits of 120 km/h and 30 km/h can only be applied in accordance with those guidelines. A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library and may also be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website. That section also provides that county and city councils may make by-laws to support the deployment of special speed limits on a periodic basis or where special circumstances prevail.</P>
        <P>Section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, in force since 20 January 2005, provides that a county or city manager may make a road works speed limit order for the application of a speed limit on any road or part of a road, including a motorway, where road works are being carried out. A road works speed limit order can be applied for any period of not more than 12 months and the minimum speed limit that may be put in place by such an order is 30 km/h.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>In January 2005, I made regulations, the Road Traffic (Speed Limit &mdash; Traffic Signs) Regulations 2005 (SI No. 10 of 2005), prescribing the regulatory traffic signs displaying metric units of measurement &mdash; km/h &mdash; that the road authorities must provide on public roads to indicate the speed limit in force. This range of traffic signs can be deployed to indicate that a default speed limit, a special speed limit or a road works speed limit is in force. On 30 November 2005, I made further <Col N="598"/>regulations, the Road Traffic (Traffic Signs &mdash; Periodic Special Speed Limits) Regulations 2005 to provide an alternative format of a speed limit traffic sign which may be deployed to indicate that a periodic special speed limit is applied.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 844 to 846, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I understand that the construction of the runway extension and the consequent amendment of the red &mdash; safety &mdash; area of runway 17 at Cork Airport was advised to Cork County Council at the time by the then Aer Rianta. The subsequent inclusion of that information in any development plan was a matter for Cork County Council.</P>
        <P>With regard to car-parking at Dublin Airport, I understand from the Dublin Airport Authority that the use of the area in question for this purpose was an operational decision required to alleviate serious congestion at the airport during peak travel periods. This was a normal day-to-day operational matter for Aer Rianta for which it was not considered necessary to seek the approval of the Department.</P>
        <P>With regard to the purchase of certain lands in 1945 at Shannon Airport, these were compulsorily acquired to cater for the potential expansion of the airport over the following 50 year period. Following the construction of runway 06/24 at Shannon, it became evident that these <Col N="599"/>lands would not be required for airport infrastructure development but could potentially be utilised for other aviation-related activities. However, subsequent to the development of a major public road on these lands to serve the Shannon Aerospace maintenance business, the portion of lands which remained north of this road became isolated from the airfield with no possibility of direct contact with the airfield infrastructure in the foreseeable future. However, the lands south of the road have been retained for aviation related development for the benefit of the airport.</P>

        <Quest>the type of investigation or inquiry put in train where there is a fatal road traffic accident; the role of his Department, the National Roads Authority, the relevant local authority and the Health and Safety Authority, in that inquiry process; the recourse open to the family of the victim of a road traffic accident should they be dissatisfied with that investigative procedure or its outcome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary immediate investigative role in relation to road accidents is vested in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Priority in such an investigation must be given to the determination of the causes of road accidents including, where appropriate, road construction or surface standards, and in particular whether a breach of the road traffic laws contributed to the occurrence.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the body empowered to make such a determination and to launch criminal proceedings against any person who the Garda consider should be accused of the commission of an offence. Garda reports on these investigations are forwarded to the National Roads Authority and subsequently to each local authority for the purpose of the establishment of accident trends and causes generally and to facilitate the carrying out of remedial works relating to road infrastructure where such action is deemed to be necessary.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the national body in Ireland with responsibility for securing health and safety at work. For this reason, the involvement of the HSA in accident investigation only arises where a collision takes place in the context of a place of work, for example, where an involved vehicle constitutes a workplace or where road works are being carried out.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of the investigations made in relation to a road traffic collision is to establish the immediate cause for the occurrence, to pursue actions to address those causes where appropriate and, where necessary, to pursue criminal prosecutions. The outcome of criminal proceedings instigated on behalf of the Garda or, in the case of a fatality, an inquest, or the determinations made in respect of other contributory causes, may influence the family of a victim to pursue issues with the appropriate authority or through the civil courts.</P>

	<P>Table 1 sets out the location and number of testers assigned to headquarter centres at present. Driver testers are in turn assigned from headquarter centres to meet the demand in other test centres. The table does not include the chief supervisory tester or the ten supervisory testers. Table 1 also sets out details of whether a centre is owned by the OPW or leased by it on my Department&rsquo;s behalf. No centre is in local authority possession. The total number of staff in all driving test centres is 126 comprising one chief tester, nine supervisory testers, one temporary supervisor tester, 109 driver testers &mdash; this number includes four driver testers who work-share, and six retired driver testers. There are no records available in my Department as to when driving test centres were first opened.</P>
        <P>Table 2 sets out the number of driving tests conducted at each test centre in 2005 and the waiting times at each centre at 23 January 2006. As the OPW is responsible for sourcing and leasing buildings on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, acquisition and rental costs are borne by it. The total cost of providing a national driving test service in 2005 was approximately &euro;12 million. A figure for each individual test centre is not available. Facilities available vary from centre to centre. However, the basic facilities include an interview and waiting room in all centres. Neither Dundalk, Killarney or Kilrush have a designated waiting room. These are temporary centres operating from alternative premises, such as hotels, while the OPW sources suitable permanent sites. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 852, 855 and 856 together.</P>
        <P>The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the Dublin Port tunnel, is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the local authorities concerned. Progress continues to be made on the construction of the tunnel. I am informed that the civil engineering work within the tunnels has now been largely completed and that the main focus of work has shifted to the installation of the mechanical and electrical systems which make up the safety and control features of the project. I understand from the NRA that the tunnel is expected to be open to traffic in summer 2006 following the testing and commissioning of the tunnels&rsquo; operational and safety features.</P>
        <P>Claims for additional costs submitted by the contractor in this case are a matter for Dublin <Col N="606"/>City Council in the first instance. It should be noted that the making of a claim by a contractor does not inevitably lead to additional payments. I understand from the NRA that the estimated cost of the Dublin Port tunnel remains at &euro;751 million.</P>
        <P>The tunnel&rsquo;s construction work has been monitored in detail since the project commenced in 2001. Design and construction is monitored by construction supervisors appointed by Dublin City Council. When problems arise, as they inevitably do with projects of this size, Dublin City Council and its construction supervisors ensure that they are detected and rectified. If remedial measures are called for at any stage the contractor is required to implement them at their own expense. I also understand that contrary to the impression that may have been created, the tunnels are safe and stable.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to an independent consultants&rsquo; report regarding the port tunnel detailing poor ventilation and the fact that the rate of leakage of ground water is almost seven times the acceptable level; if his attention has further been drawn to inadequate pumping arrangements, defective lining of the tunnel roof and the lack of adequate concrete on the ceiling; and the completion date for the port tunnel.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 853 and 859 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The construction of the Dublin Port tunnel and issues related thereto are matters for the contractor, Dublin City Council, and the National Roads Authority, NRA, in the first instance. I understand from the NRA that a safety audit of the<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="607"/><?oasys _fc ?>project confirms that the Dublin Port tunnel complies in all respects with the requirements of the proposed EU directive on safety in road tunnels and that national and EU air quality standards have been fully taken into account in the design and construction of the tunnel. In supervising the design and construction of the Dublin Port tunnel the NRA has been fully cognisant of the need to ensure the highest standard of safety provision and has taken account of the most up-to-date standards and guidance. The operating system for the tunnel and the ventilation and safety systems have been designed with safety as a paramount parameter. Measures to deal with accidents, breakdowns and fires in the tunnel are all being installed.</P>
        <P>The tunnel&rsquo;s construction work has been monitored in detail since the project commenced in 2001. Design and construction is monitored by construction supervisors appointed by Dublin City Council. When problems arise, as they inevitably do with projects of this size, Dublin City Council and its construction supervisors ensure that they are detected and rectified.</P>
        <P>If remedial measures are called for at any stage the contractor is required to implement them at their own expense. I also understand, contrary to the impression that may have been created, that the tunnels are safe and stable. At no time could or have these leaks contributed any risk to the health and safety of the workforce or to residents hundreds of metres away. I understand that the tunnel is expected to be completed and open to traffic in summer 2006.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if his Department will be contributing to the essential repairs to Balbriggan and Skerries Harbours now that his Department has finalised the ownership transfer from Dublin Port Company to Fingal County Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1059/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Balbriggan and Skerries Harbours were transferred from the ownership of Dublin Port Company to the control of Fingal County Council in 2004 as provided for in the Harbours Act 1996.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of a submission regarding works required at Balbriggan and Skerries Harbours by Fingal County Council in 2005, the Department responsible at the time, the Depart<Col N="608"/>ment of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, made a once-off payment of &euro;231,817 as a contribution to the total work required at the harbours. Further contributions from this Department are not currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>Government policy in relation to ports, including the regional harbours, is set out in the Ports Policy Statement published in January 2005. The policy statement notes that many regional harbours have neither the resources nor the capability to comply with aspects of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, whereas their transfer to local authority control would bring improved corporate governance and allow the harbours to realise their amenity potential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to advance the implementation of the ports policy statement with regard to the transfer of regional harbours to local authority control. The Department has invested in essential public safety works at a number of regional harbours in 2004-05 and plans to continue with a similar programme of works in 2006. The Department proposes to make funds available to allow additional works to be undertaken at the regional harbours where appropriate and justifiable, to protect the public and the fabric of the harbours. The Department is currently assessing what essential works might be undertaken in 2006 within the limited budget available.</P>

	<P>I have not entered into any commitment in the terms suggested by the Deputy. The decision to dispose of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus was made following detailed and comprehensive consideration of the issue by my Government colleagues and me. In accordance with the terms of Sustaining Progress, I engaged with the trade unions on the issue early in 2005 before the Government finalised its consideration of the matter. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions made a proposal for a State-owned holding company which would become the vehicle for State ownership of and investment in commercial State companies. In advance of the Government finalising its consideration on the future of Aer Lingus, I understand that the many issues and concerns which would arise from ICTU&rsquo;s proposal were conveyed in detail to ICTU by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 865, 866, 870, 873 and 875 together.</P>
        <P>On 6 December 2005, the European Parliament and the European Council reached agreement through the conciliation process on a new EU regulation designed to improve driving times and rest periods for professional drivers. The new rules will replace the existing drivers&rsquo; hours rules which have not been updated since 1985. It is expected that the legal text of the new regulation will be formally adopted later this month and will enter into force throughout the EU as soon as it is published in the <i>EU Official Journal</i>. The new regulation includes a number of changes to the existing rules, including the removal of the existing provision that allows drivers of passenger vehicles involved in non-regular services to drive for up to 12 continuous days before taking a weekly rest period. As the provisions of the new regulation have been agreed at EU level, there is no scope for making changes at this stage.</P>

	<P>The new Shannon and Cork Airport authorities were incorporated in September 2004. In line with the framework provided by the State Airports Act 2004, the two new authorities will own and operate the airports when sufficient distributable reserves are available to the Dublin Airport Authority to transfer the relevant airport assets to them. Under the 2004 Act, the Ministers for Transport and Finance must be satisfied about the authorities&rsquo; state of operational and financial readiness before the assets of the airports can be vested in them. The formulation of comprehensive business plans will be a key aspect of achieving operational and financial readiness. The capital structures of each of the State airports is subject to determining the optimum mechanisms for allocating airport assets among the three airports, having regard to the capital maintenance rules and other provisions of the Companies Acts. The position on the transfer of assets to the Cork Airport Authority was set out during the passing of the State Airports Act 2004. The tight<Col N="615"/>ness of the Dublin Airport Authority&rsquo;s distributable reserves meant that a phased approach to restructuring was outlined at the time. The option of the negotiation of a finance lease covering a portion of Cork Airport&rsquo;s assets, to facilitate the earlier establishment of that airport as a fully independent airport, was also mentioned. I assure the Deputy that Cork Airport&rsquo;s ability to operate on a completely commercial basis will be fully assessed as part of the business planning process and will be factored into the decisions made.</P>

Significant investment has been made in associated infrastructure, such as bridges, level crossings and fencing. Work is under way on a project to modernise the signalling system on the line, to be completed in 2007. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will begin taking delivery in 2007 of 150 new Intercity railcars to replace old rolling stock on a number of lines including the Westport line. Combined with the upgrading of the fixed infrastructure, the new railcars will allow the company to operate an increased frequency and improved journey times on the line, as well as improved reliability and comfort. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated that it proposes to provide a service pattern of five services daily in each direction on the Westport line when the new rolling stock comes into service.</P>

	<P>The use of bus lanes is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998. The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. The regulations, which have national application, generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. an exemption to the restriction relating to the use of with-flow bus lanes is allowed in respect of taxis, having regard to their role in providing an on-street immediate hire service, when they are being used in the course of business. Many representations have been received by the Department of Transport from interests seeking to extend access to bus lanes to a wide range of other road users, including hackney and limousine operators and motorcyclists. A review of the access issue, which was carried out in 2001, took account of the physical characteristics of the vehicles seeking access, including motorcycles. The views of the director of traffic of Dublin City Council, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were sought as part of that review. All those bodies suggested there should be no change to the current position. That remains the position.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 888 and 889 together.</P>
        <P>I have not directed a date under Article 18(1) of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety Establishment Order 1968 by which the medical bureau is required to submit its annual report. The bureau submits its annual report and accounts to the Department on the completion of the audit of the accounts by the Office of the Comptroller and <Col N="623"/>Auditor General, and after the translation of the report into Irish under section 10 of the Official Languages Act 2003. The bureau submitted the 2004 annual report and audited accounts to the Department in November 2005 and the report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in December 2005. It is a matter for the bureau to publish the report. I understand, in this context, that the report is being printed at present, and will be published in the coming weeks. Work is commencing in the bureau on the preparation of the 2005 annual report and accounts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Data relating to the results of the tests carried out by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in respect of the establishment of the presence of drugs and-or alcohol in samples presented to it by the Garda are set out in the bureau&rsquo;s annual reports. Data relating to 2005 is not yet available. However, in 2004, 569 specimens were tested for the presence of a drugs or drugs. This figure includes all the specimens received which were under the legal limit for alcohol and 32 specimens where the alcohol level was over the legal limit and drug analysis was requested by the Garda. There were also four specimens where subsequent drug analysis was requested by the Garda in respect of persons who had been required to submit to evidential breath tests.</P>
        <P>The 2004 report does not give details of the number of positive tests for drugs on samples found to be below the legal limit for alcohol. However, 354 specimens tested positive and 247 specimens were confirmed positive. In 2004, a total of 12,161 blood, urine and breath specimens were analysed for alcohol concentration. Some 4,103 blood and urine specimens were received for analysis in 2004 and 8,058 breath specimens were taken at Garda stations. Some 84.6% of blood and urine samples analysed were found to be over the legal limit for alcohol and 80.1% of breath specimens were over the legal limit.</P>

                <entry>
Section 36 introduces a system of automatic disqualification from applying for or holding a licence for those who have been convicted of one of a range of very serious offences. The section includes provisions through which a person who is affected by this provision can request the courts to allow them to apply for a licence in certain restricted circumstances. In addition, where a person has committed one of a number of serious traffic offences he or she will be disqualified from holding a licence to drive a small public service vehicle for a period additional to any driving disqualification that is applied. Some amendments were made to section 36 in section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 2004.

Commencement of this section requires further consultation with and briefing of licensing authorities, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service, the Commission for Taxi regulation and others, to ensure that the appropriate arrangements for implementation are in place. Specific legal advice on a number of issues surrounding the practical application of the section has been sought from the Office of the Attorney General. It will be necessary to give an appropriate period of advance notice of the proposed commencement of this section to allow persons who may be affected by the provisions, in particular existing licence holders, to clarify their position with the courts. Commencement of the section will be considered in consultation with the Commission for Taxi Regulation, when the legal and administrative issues have been resolved.

A commencement order has not been made in respect of Section 16 of the Road Transport Act 1999. This section provides for a payment in lieu of prosecution system for offences under the Road Transport Acts and regulations on drivers&rsquo; hours and rest periods. It was intended to use Section 16 as the basis for a fixed penalty charge system for such offences. However, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that a new provision in primary legislation is necessary for the type of fixed penalty system envisaged. As a result, there are no plans to commence Section 16 of the Road Transport Act 1999.

      Road Traffic Act 2002 &mdash; section 17.
	         </entry>
                <entry>
Section 17 provides for increased penalties for motor insurance offences compared with the penalties provided for in earlier Road Traffic legislation.
	         </entry>
                <entry>
Commencement of Section 17 was deferred largely because of the preparatory work being put into the development of Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2004. Part 5 consolidates the original section 56 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (and also increases the penalties for motor insurance offences) while also providing a framework to deal with the issue of a ceiling on motor insurance cover, if/when such is required. The question of a ceiling on liability is likely to arise when it is no longer possible for insurance companies to re-insure for their present unlimited exposure. The insurance industry has informed this Department that this situation will arise over the next year or so as re-insurance companies refuse to provide reinsurance cover for unlimited liabilities. Therefore Part 5 of the 2004 Act will not be commenced until the requirement for a limit on motor insurance is proven.

	<P>The EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, more commonly known as the Eurovignette directive, has been under consideration by the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council and by the European Parliament since its publication in July 2003. It was agreed by the European Parliament on 15 December on the basis of a compromise text put forward by the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council in response to the European Parliament&rsquo;s amendment proposals. Ireland&rsquo;s negotiating position was discussed in some detail at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport held on Wednesday, 20 October 2004. As outlined at that meeting, our focus in the negotiations was to ensure that the proposed directive achieved an acceptable balance between ensuring that the approach to toll calculation did not increase <Col N="634"/>transport costs in accessing European markets by road, and the need to maintain flexibility to design tolling schemes that would continue to attract private sector financing for the roads programme through toll based PPPs. I consider that the amending directive, as now agreed, to which we contributed considerable effort during our Presidency in 2004, provides a good framework for HGV charging which acknowledges the special circumstances of toll based PPPs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Currently in Europe there are criteria laid down by the joint aviation authorities, JAA, for the carriage of persons with reduced mobility, PRMs, by airline operators. Those criteria mean that airlines must: establish procedure for the carriage of PRMs, follow the guidelines on the locations of PRMs, and ensure that the aircraft commander is notified of PRMs on board.</P>
        <P>In designing their procedures for dealing with PRMs airline operators take into account emergency and evacuation situations and particular conditions applicable to their flight operations including different types of aircraft, equipment on board and crewing levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Each airline&rsquo;s procedures for the carriage of PRMs form part of their operating manual, and are approved by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, as part of the IAA&rsquo;s safety regulation of the airline. Airlines can therefore carry PRMs up to the limit allowed under their procedures.</P>
        <P>Under a new European regulation, expected to be approved by Council in March 2006, and which was strongly supported by Ireland, new rights will be put in place to ensure that PRMs are given assistance at airports and while embarking and disembarking aircraft. This legislation will ensure that PRMs can only be refused carriage on aircraft in order to meet applicable safety requirements established by international, Community or national law, in order to meet safety requirements established by the authority that issued the air operator&rsquo;s certificate to the air carrier concerned, or if the size of the aircraft or its doors makes the embarkation or carriage of that disabled person or person with reduced mobility physically impossible.</P>
        <P>These rights in the regulation will come into force in early 2007, while other parts of the regulation will come into force one year later. The proposed regulation envisages that each national aviation authority can establish common rules for aircraft on its register regarding the number and manner of carriage of PRMs on different aircraft. My Department has already written to the IAA about this new regulation, to ensure that Ireland and the IAA will be in a position to comply fully with its requirements from the beginning of 2007 onwards. The proposed new regulation also provides for a national enforcement body to be put in place in each member state. When the regulation is formally adopted and becomes law, I will finalise my consideration of which body should be designated, and designate that body in due course.</P>
        <P>Under the Disability Act 2005, I, along with five other Ministers, am obliged to prepare and publish a sectoral plan on matters specified in the Act. The sectoral plan must be laid before the <Col N="637"/>Houses of the Oireachtas by 28 July 2006. My Department held a seminar and workshops on accessible transport in Dublin Castle on 13 January 2006, to launch a discussion paper on the sectoral plan, and comments received will be taken into account when finalising the plan for presentation to the Oireachtas.</P>

The company has just submitted an application for funding for additional fleet requirements, which has due regard to the emerging findings of the network review. I will make a decision when the assessment has been completed. While the document includes proposed improvements for the Clondalkin area, the deployment of its fleet is a day to day matter for Dublin Bus.</P>

        <P>The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005 provided for significant changes in relation to the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts. Under this new legislation, the Minister is required to consult with appropriate Ministers for the purpose of developing a proposal for submission to Government for approval.

        <P>The position is as follows. A new board of seven members was appointed to the Western Development Commission, WDC, in 2002. In 2003, one replacement appointment was made to this board. A new board of five members was appointed in 2004. There are currently no vacancies on the WDC board.</P>
        <P>Three appointments were made to the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in 2005. Three appointments were made to the board of Arramara Teoranta in 2003. There are no vacancies at present on either board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Appointments to the board of the Foras Teanga are made jointly by myself and the appropriate Northern Ireland Minister acting as the North-South Ministerial Council. The Foras Teanga comprises two agencies: the Ulster Scots Agency and Foras na Gaeilge. Each has a separate board, which together constitutes the board of the North-South language body, an Foras Teanga. There are 14 members on the board of Foras na Gaeilge, who were appointed in 2002. Two other board members appointed in 2002 resigned, leaving two vacancies at present. The question of making appointments to fill the two existing vacancies will be considered in due course in the North-South context.</P>
        <P>The board of the Ulster Scots Agency, eight members, was appointed in 2002. There are no vacancies at present.</P>
        <P>Twelve members of Bord na Leabhair Gaeilge were appointed in 2005. There are currently no vacancies on this board.</P>
        <P>The 12 members of an Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha were appointed in 2003. There are no vacancies at present.</P>
        <P>One appointment was made to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board in 2003 to <Col N="642"/>fill a vacancy. In 2005, four reappointments were made to the board in respect of members whose terms of office had expired. The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act provided for the dissolution of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board and for the establishment of a reconstituted board, Dormant Accounts Board. I established this board on 4 January 2006, and appointed a chairperson and 11 members. There are no vacancies on this board.</P>
        <P>For the sake of completeness, two appointments have been made by Government, in accordance with the Charities Act 1961 to the board of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland since 2002. There is a one vacancy on the board.</P>
        <P>An additional five members nominated by Government were appointed to the board of Area Development Management Limited, ADM, in 2004 under the company&rsquo;s memorandum and articles of association at the time. In 2005, following changes to the articles and memorandum of association, which included a change of name to Pobal, the Government appointed seven members to the board. There are no vacancies on the board of Pobal.</P>

        <P>While it is my intention that the focus of dormant accounts funding should be directed towards tackling disadvantage in Ireland, the Government is committed to providing supports for vulnerable Irish communities living abroad. This commitment is clearly demonstrated by the allocation of significant funding from the Exchequer through the Department of Foreign Affairs. In this regard, over &euro;8.25 million was allocated for emigrant services in 2005. Most of this allocation, more than &euro;7 million, was distributed in grants to groups in Britain providing services to the Irish community living there. In 2006, funding for emigrant services will exceed &euro;12 million and it can be anticipated that most of this funding will again be directed at groups in Britain providing services to the Irish community and in particular to support the most vulnerable and marginalised.</P>

        <P>Due to the diverse nature of my Department&rsquo;s activities, I am not in a position to provide a response in regard to the number of reports that were produced under consultancies since June 2002, within the time available. My Department is collating the material for reply and I will forward the material directly to the Deputy when it is complete.</P>

        <P>Each application received under the scheme was assessed by Pobal on behalf of my Department by reference to the criteria set out in the published guidelines, and scored accordingly. The application from the organisation in question failed to achieve a sufficiently high score to enable it to be considered for funding on this occasion. It is open to the applicant organisation to have the decision reviewed by applying in writing to the Department as advised in the notification letter which issued to the organisation recently.</P>

	<P>First, I wish to clarify that it is not the position that a person can obtain a grant from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta without submitting an application.</P>
        <P>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to my response to Parliamentary Question No. 248 on 15 December 2005 in which I explained that an application can be made in either of two ways: by means of a generic application form which elicits the essential data for assessment of the application, or by means of other acceptable documentation, such as a formal business plan, which also includes the essential data required. The position is likewise in the case of submitting claims for payment. The need for amending legislation in this matter does not arise.</P>

	<P>Under the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, each of the 14 local drugs task forces, including that for Tallaght, has in place an action plan to tackle drug misuse in their area, based on their own identified priorities.</P>
        <P>Specifically focusing on cocaine, I approved funding of almost &euro;400,000 for four pilot cocaine treatment projects and a training initiative operating in various drugs task force areas. One of these treatment projects is located in the Tallaght area. It is run by the community addiction response project, Killinarden and St. Dominic&rsquo;s, and it is targeted at problematic intranasal cocaine users. Generally the feedback from these pilot projects has been positive and it is hoped that they will help in generating an overall response to the cocaine problem. Formal assess<Col N="665"/>ment of the projects is being undertaken by Goodbody Economic Consultants Limited and it is expected that a preliminary report will be available in the coming months. As there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine, services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are utilised to help misusers. In that regard, the health services have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in the last number of years.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that, through the implementation of the actions in the national drugs strategy and the projects and initiatives operated through the local drugs task force, the problem of cocaine in the Tallaght region is being addressed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 931 and 932 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question 32690/05 of 8 November 2005. In that reply, I advised the Deputy of the 2004 amendment to the Finance Act 1999 which provided for the introduction of a scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels. A scheme under the Act was launched by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in April 2005 and was open to applicants from all areas, including rural and Gaeltacht areas. A total of 34 applications were received under the call for proposals by the closing date and eight projects were awarded excise relief under the scheme over a two-year period to 2007. Among the successful projects were proposals for the Galway, Donegal, Kilkenny, Wexford and Wicklow regions. The scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development, and will cost &euro;6 million in excise foregone over the two year period.</P>
        <P>Following the success of this pilot biofuels scheme, a package of excise relief valued at &euro;205 million was announced in the context of budget 2006 and will allow Ireland reach a target of 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008. Funding is also being provided towards the capital cost of developing biofuels processing facilities. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is now developing a suite of measures to roll out the new biofuels programme, in consultation with the Department of Finance. A more detailed study on policy options for development of a biofuels market will be pub<Col N="667"/>lished by Sustainable Energy Ireland shortly. This follows publication of the &ldquo;Liquid Biofuels Strategy Study for Ireland&rdquo; by Sustainable Energy Ireland in 2004 and referred to in my earlier reply.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy including biofuels. In the circumstances, I have no plans for this Department to carry out additional research in this area. However, as part of my Department&rsquo;s overall remit in relation to rural development matters, I continue to maintain a close interest in matters relevant to the development of rural areas especially in an emerging policy context. In this regard, I should mention that my officials are in ongoing discussions with Sustainable Energy Ireland, Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann-The Irish Islands Federation and individual island communities regarding the promotion of sustainable energy projects on the islands.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payments scheme national reserve under category B.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and-or ewe quota or other investments.</P>
        <P>The position is that over 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national <Col N="668"/>reserve were received when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>My Department will be in contact with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed and formal letters setting out my Department&rsquo;s decision will be issued in the near future.</P>

        <P>All farmers, including those in REPS, will be required to comply with the regulations. Farmers in REPS will not be required to amend their existing plans, but they may need to make adjustments to their farming systems such as storage for animal manure, restrictions on spreading periods and overall fertiliser limits. Like all farmers, they should consult their advisers about the practical steps that may need to be taken.</P>
        <P>The specifications for REPS planners are currently being amended in line with the nitrates regulations and the new version will be provided to REPS planners shortly. REPS plans drawn up subsequently will be required to meet these specifications.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who signed regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme on nitrates on 11 December 2005.</P><Col N="669"/>
        <P>Ireland is proceeding with its request for a derogation designed to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum. My Department is taking the lead in this matter and, with the support of Teagasc, will continue to work with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government toward achieving a successful outcome.</P>
        <P>The process commenced formally at a meeting of the EU nitrates committee in December, when an outline of Ireland&rsquo;s proposal was presented. Detailed discussions between officials of my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the European Commission have since taken place. Following these discussions the detailed scientific argument in support of the proposal is being finalised, and will be submitted formally to the Commission very shortly. Other member states will then have the opportunity to ask questions prior to a more detailed presentation at next meeting of the nitrates committee in March.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the need to conclude the process quickly and I am hopeful that the approval process can be finalised as early as possible in 2006.</P>

	<P>An application under the 2005 single payment scheme was received from the person named on 10 May 2005. One land parcel was included on the application, which was processed by my Department and paid on 1 December 2005.

	<P>I propose to take Parliamentary Questions Nos. 939 and 963 together.</P>
        <P>The person named established 49.45 entitlements under the single payment scheme. The person named declared a total of 32.03 eligible hectares and 17.70 forestry hectares in his 2005 single payment application. Under EU legislation, in order to draw down the full single payment an applicant must declare an eligible hectare in respect of each entitlement. This requirement was set out clearly in the documentation supplied to farmers on a number of occasions. Therefore, payment of &euro;2,456.94 issued to the applicant based on 32.03 eligible forage hectares declared on the 2005 single payment application form.</P>
        <P>All applicants who did not receive the full single payment due to their failure to submit an application for consolidation of their entitlements were requested to submit a letter outlining their particular circumstances. My Department intends to begin examining all such cases in the near future.</P>

	<P>Under the scrapie programme, infected flocks are restricted and all of the animals are genotyped. Following the receipt of the genotype results the susceptible animals, including rams in category 4 and category 5 are valued and sent for slaughter. In 2005 a total of 63 rams from 19 positive flocks were identified in category 4 and category 5. These animals were valued and slaughtered and compensation was paid to the flock owners concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has operated a voluntary national genotype programme since May 2004. At 31 December 2005, almost 43,000 sheep had been genotyped. Between 1 September and <Col N="673"/>18 November last, a number of financial enhancements were added to the programme and contributed to a significant increase in participation levels.</P>
        <P>My Department has had discussions over recent months with farming bodies and pedigree breeders on arrangements for the introduction of a compulsory breeding programme, pursuant to Commission decision 2003/100/EC. I expect that these discussions will conclude shortly and the compulsory programme should be in place soon thereafter.</P>
        <P>The principal aims of the programme are to increase the frequency of the ARR allele in the Irish sheep flock while, at the same time, reducing the prevalence of the VRQ alleles which have been shown to contribute to susceptibility to TSEs, leading to their eventual elimination.</P>
        <P>The effect of this will be to increase the resistance of the national sheep flock to classical scrapie through the use of genotyping to determine resistance. This is very important in improving the overall health status of the flock and the subsequent reduction in the incidence of scrapie.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the forthcoming programme also reflects the increasing emphasis being placed on the quality and safety of fresh meat. It is in the interest of all sheep breeders to anticipate a future demand for sheep of certain genotypes and the compulsory programme will play a long-term and central role in the breeding of animals and the marketing of sheepmeat.</P>
        <P>In regard to the non-availability of category 1 and 2 breeding stock, provision is made in the Commission decision for individual breeding programmes to be implemented taking account of the frequency of the different alleles within each breed in order to avoid the danger of inbreeding or genetic drift. The forthcoming compulsory breeding programme will take account of this concern.</P>
        <P>Although the Commission decision does not make provision for the payment of compensation to flock owners who are required to slaughter sheep identified as highly susceptible to scrapie, the forthcoming programme will include a compensation dimension in respect of sheep that have to be slaughtered. It is not, however, intended to include an income support element in this programme.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for 2004 suckler cow premium which was received in the local office of my Department on 4 May 2004. The application form was returned to the person named as he had not indicated the number of animals he wished to submit for premium. This was returned and the person named confirmed that the application was in respect of nine cows and three heifers.</P>
        <P>A number of queries arose following validation of the application; six of the cows applied on had no calves registered to them prior to the application date of 4 May 2004. One of the six cows was also found not to have been in the ownership and possession of the person named at the time of application, following validation against the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, database. Another tag number showed an invalid breed error. an agricultural officer visited the farm to confirm the breed of the animal showing invalid breed error and this query was resolved. A letter issued to the person named on 14 November 2004, advising him that six cows were being rejected and that he had a right to appeal this decision.</P>
        <P>Following a second validation, it was found that another of the animals applied on had been slaughtered during the six-month retention period. The slaughter records showed this animal as having been slaughtered out of a herd other than that of the person named. The applicant was advised in writing on 22 March 2005 that this animal was also rejected.</P>
        <P>The person named was not an applicant under any of the other bovine schemes for 2004. Therefore, following the rejection of seven of the animals submitted under the suckler cow scheme there were only five remaining eligible animals. Since the non-compliance in this case is equivalent to 140%, the number rejected by the <Col N="676"/>number eligible, no premium was payable under the 2004 scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, in accordance with the EU legislation governing the suckler cow scheme, a penalty of &euro;1,569.05 was applicable. This amount was deducted from the amount due to the person named under the single payment scheme in 2005.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person named to lodge an appeal in regard to the decision of my Department to reject his 2004 suckler cow application and to apply a penalty. To date, no letter of appeal has been received in regard to either of the rejection letters that issued. However, should the person named wish to lodge an appeal in regard to the findings as outlined, he should do so in writing, without further delay, outlining clearly the basis of his appeal.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 956 to 959, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. That Department, in association with my Department and in consultation with Teagasc, has been engaged in prolonged and difficult discussions with the European Commission on Ireland&rsquo;s proposals to implement the directive. These discussions culminated in the making of the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2005 by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The regulations come into effect on 1 February.</P>
        <P>Throughout the discussions, the Commission took a firm position on all matters relating to the pig industry. The regulations include limits on the quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus in livestock manure that may be landspread. The immediate imposition of these limits on the entire pig sector would have caused difficulties since the majority of producers do not have enough land on which to spread the livestock manure they produce.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The regulations, as finally agreed with the Commission, include a significant provision that will apply to pig producers holding IPC-IPPC licences, who are responsible for 80% of production. Pending a review of each case by the EPA, to be completed by October 2007, such producers may continue to operate under the licences they currently hold. This means that the arrangements these producers have in place for exporting their manure will continue to be valid for some time. The most important aspect of this is that the farmers who take pig manure from these producers can continue to take it in accordance with their existing nutrient management plans.</P><Col N="678"/>
        <P>This important concession negotiated with the Commission recognises that these producers are already operating under a system of regulation approved by the EPA. Regrettably, it was not possible to secure a similar concession for unlicensed producers. I am aware that a number of these producers may encounter difficulty in finding lands on which their manure can be utilised. I have, therefore, called on Teagasc advisers and REPS planners to encourage their clients to take in pig manure as a substitute for chemical fertiliser. By doing so they will save money, while at the same time giving valuable help to their colleagues in the pig sector.</P>
        <P>Following a meeting with pig industry representatives in Donegal, I recently agreed with Teagasc to set up a working group within the county which will assist pig producers in meeting the requirements of the nitrates directive. The group will be chaired by Teagasc and will include officials of my Department, agricultural consultants and representatives of the farming sector, especially pig producers and arable farmers. Other farmers such as cereal and potato producers would have an important complementary role to play in assisting in the utilisation of valuable nutrients from pig farms, and co-operation between farmers will be critical in protecting the future of pig production. I hope that a similar type approach can be adopted in other counties in assisting pig and poultry sectors in meeting the challenges of the nitrates directive.</P>
        <P>In the medium term, I would encourage pig producers to look into changes in feeding regimes which will reduce the phosphorus content of pig manure, and to consider the use of new technologies to separate dry matter from liquid. Proposals for grant aid, which my officials are currently discussing with the European Commission, will include assistance for the purchase of such technology. I also intend to make funds available to support the demonstration of new technologies for the treatment and possible use in bio-energy production of livestock manures, in particular from the pig and poultry sectors.</P>
        <P>The regulations also include a separate provision which will benefit smaller units with 100 pigs or fewer. For these, a lesser storage requirement, 16, 18, 20 or 22 weeks depending on the zone, applies on condition that there are adequate spreadlands on the holding to utilise all the manure produced there without exceeding the nitrogen and phosphorus limits in the regulations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent agreement on the reform of the EU sugar regime provides for partial compensation for growers for the drop in the minimum price of beet. In the event that sugar production ceases in Ireland, a once off payment of almost &euro;44 million would be available for growers and a restructuring fund of up to &euro;145 million, would become available to provide compensation for the economic, social and environmental costs arising from factory closure. The agreement provides that 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. This amount may be increased by member states after consultation with interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured.</P>
        <P>The formal texts giving effect to the agreement will be adopted by the Council of Ministers early this year. The Commission will then come forward with proposals for detailed implementing rules. Pending the adoption of the relevant regulations it is not possible to give further definitive information at this stage.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application, supported by medical evidence, for consideration of his circumstances under the <i>force majeure</i> measure of the single farm payment scheme. While the medical evidence was non-specific in respect of the effect on production or the applicant&rsquo;s ability or inability to farm, it was nevertheless accepted in good faith by my Department. It was, therefore, decided to exclude the 2000-2002 reference period and to base the single farm payment entitlements on the earlier reference period 1997-99.</P>
        <P>However, the person named appealed this decision on the grounds that he wished to have 1999 excluded from the calculations and have his <Col N="680"/>entitlements based on 1997 and 1998 only. During the course of the examination of the circumstances surrounding this appeal, it transpired that very significant increases had occurred in the quantity of milk quota held by the person named, as set out in the following table.</P>

        <P FLI="0">While the increase in 2001 is mainly attributable to the annexation of the quota held by his spouse, it was clear that over the years the person named had increased his quota by approximately 23,000 gallons in his own right. My Department was of the view that such increases were inconsistent with an inability to farm and indicated a clear decision by the person named to focus his production on his dairy enterprise with a consequential reduction in his beef enterprise. My Department had no option but to reverse the decision to base entitlements on the 1997-99 reference period.</P>
        <P>Consequently, the person named was informed on 26 November 2005 that his single farm payment entitlements would be based on the 2000-02 reference period. Entitlements for this reference period, including the decoupled dairy premium, are in excess of &euro;13,000. There are no grounds at this point which would merit a review of this decision by my Department. However, the person named may appeal this decision to the single payment appeals committee which will carry out a full assessment of my Department&rsquo;s decision in this case.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payments scheme national reserve under categories B(i), B(ii) and C.</P>
        <P>Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and/or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. Investments can include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota, or other investments. Category C cat<Col N="681"/>ers for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold their milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and/or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</P>
        <P>More than 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category.

	<P>The rate of pension payable under <Col N="687"/>the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming is the maximum amount provided for by the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. My Department&rsquo;s original proposals for the current early retirement scheme, which commenced on 27 November 2000 and is one of the measures in the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-06, included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted on legal grounds that a fixed rate be set instead. I have not put proposals to the Commission for an increase in the pension under either scheme.</P>

        <Quest>if the benefits of more extensive broadleaf tree planting particularly in terms of the quantity of carbon dioxide which can be sequestered per acre of broadleaf trees planted on an annual basis have been assessed.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The benefits of planting broadleaves are well understood and at the start of the current <Col N="688"/>programming period, 2000-06, an ambitious target was set to increase the planting of broadleaves from 13% of new afforestation to 30% by the end of the programme. I am happy to say that we are well on path to reaching this target, with broadleaf planting now representing some 29% of new planting.</P>
        <P>In terms of its contribution to carbon sequestration, current estimates, averaged over the main broadleaf species, indicate that approximately 1.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide can be sequestered per hectare, per annum. This is equivalent to 0.54 tonnes of carbon dioxide per acre. The value of carbon sequestration is not confined to broadleaf species because conifers also sequester carbon and indeed do so at a faster rate initially than broadleaves. Over the long term, however, storage of carbon is similar for both conifers and broadleaves.</P>

The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payments scheme national reserve under categories A and D.</P>
        <P>Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May 2005 where the land in question was leased to a third party during the reference period 2000-02. While the land concerned is being leased by the person named, the fee involved does not satisfy the criteria for eligibility under category A.</P>
        <P>Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year. In addition the farmer must have either purchased or inherited land. As the person named applied for an allocation of entitlements on leased land only he does not quality under this category.</P>

	<P>The persons named began their REPS contract on 1 November 1999. They were, therefore, subject to the arrangements governing the transition between the first REP scheme and REPS 2. Accordingly they gave a written undertaking to complete the measures specified in their REPS plan over a five-year period and to integrate and adapt that plan in a new commitment under the new REP scheme when it came into operation. The new scheme, REPS 2, came into operation on 27 November 2000.</P>
        <P>A REPS 2 plan from the persons named was received on 31 December 200. It was rejected as being ineligible and returned on 28 May 2002. The persons named were given a further two months to submit an acceptable REPS 2 plan, but failed to do so. My Department had no option, therefore, but to terminate their REPS plan and seek a refund of the payments they had already received. The persons named were told of their right to appeal this decision to the agriculture appeals office, but they did not exercise it. It is open to the persons named to submit an application under the current scheme, REPS 3. If their application is successful, the amount to be recovered may be offset against payments due under REPS 3.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1004 to 1007, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The table supplied sets out the number of farmers in each county whose payments under the 2005 single payment scheme had issued by 23 January 2006. The number of applications with <Col N="695"/>outstanding problems, which must be solved prior to payment is also set out. Payments will continue to issue to farmers as their applications are processed to completion in accordance with the EU legislation governing the single payment scheme. Under this legislation member states may commence payment under the single payment scheme on 1 December of the year of application with payments being fully processed by the following 30 June.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My priority in 2005, the first year of this new scheme, was to maximise the number of payments to eligible applicants by the earliest date possible of 1 December and I am satisfied that this was achieved. Since then it has been my absolute priority to ensure that the issues that are holding up the remaining cases are resolved with the applicants concerned and that payments are made without undue delay. To this end, I have arranged that payments are issued on a very regular basis as soon as the problems with the outstanding cases are resolved.</P>
        <P>A dedicated help line with a lo-call number was established in April of 2005 by my Department to assist farmers with queries relating to the single payment scheme. From the beginning of December the number of staff answering calls to the help line was increased. The staff dealt with over 17,000 calls during the first three weeks of December. The dedication of staff to deal specifically with the single lo-call number during December allowed other staff to maximise the rate of clearance of applications for payment.</P>
        <P>Eleven lo-call numbers have replaced the single lo-call number since 23 December. The dispersal of the calls in a more targeted fashion was designed to reduce the time spent by farmers in contacting my Department and to ensure that the person taking the call would be in a position to deal with the specific detailed queries then being received. This revised arrangement is working well with farmers&rsquo; telephone queries being resolved on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted applications for consideration in respect of both the new entrant and inheritance measures of the single payment scheme. Following processing of both applications, he was notified that his application for consideration in respect of the new entrant measure was unsuccessful because he did not commence farming activity during the reference years from 2000 to 2002. The application for consideration in respect of the inheritance measure was successful. The application of the person named was processed and payment amounting to &euro;15,142.46 in respect of the 2005 single payment scheme was made on 24 January 2006.</P>

	<P>Under EU legislation, in order to draw down his or her full single payment, an applicant must declare an eligible hectare to accompany each entitlement. This requirement was set out clearly in the documentation supplied to farmers on a number of occasions. While the person named established 54.46 entitlements, the single payment scheme application form received on 26 April 2005 declared 52.07 forage hectares. Payment amounting to &euro;15,174.59 under the scheme, therefore, was based on the 52.07 eligible hectares declared. This payment was issued on 24 January 2006.</P>
        <P>If the person named declares sufficient land on his 2006 single payment scheme application, he will be in a position to claim full entitlements. Payment of the relevant forest premium will be made in the next two weeks.</P>

	<P>An enabling provision to allow for the extension of our comprehensive beef labelling regulations to require operators in the hotel, restaurant and catering sectors to provide country of origin information to their customers on the beef they serve is at present before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Department is well advanced in drafting the necessary beef regulations. While the regulations will need to be submitted for EU approval, it is hoped that this process will not delay the making of the final regulations.</P>
        <P>I have also written to the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection requesting that consideration be given to extending the rules in regard to origin labelling of poultry meat. This is a follow up to my having raised the issue in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council some months ago.</P>
        <P>The proposed enabling legislation currently before the House will facilitate the extension of origin labelling to pigmeat, as well as other meats. However, all the regulations that would be necessary will be subject to EU approval.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food ensures that primary producers and the food industry pursue high standards of food safety and quality. Only food produced to the highest stan<Col N="698"/>dards of food safety and quality should be placed on the market. Responsibility for meeting these standards rests primarily with the industry itself, with the role of the regulatory authorities being to provide assurances required by law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Ireland, there are a number of voluntary quality assurance schemes in the food sector offering additional assurances of quality. Bord Bia operates such schemes in the beef, pigmeat, horticulture, poultry and egg sectors. The schemes describe the essential quality assurance requirements from primary production right through to the final consumer. In 2003, the European Commission agreed to a change in the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme logo used on pork and bacon to include an indication of the country of origin. This logo provides consumers with an assurance that all pork and bacon carrying the logo is sourced from quality assured farms and with information on the country of origin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the policy of Bord Bia to encourage the use of the new quality assurance scheme logo on eligible products, and a range of promotional activities to increase consumer awareness of the logo has been undertaken in recent years. In 2005, this involved a combination of television, radio, press and outdoor advertising combined with point of sale material in retail outlets. All Bord Bia pigmeat promotions display the logo. A recent national consumer awareness survey indicated that two thirds of the population are now aware of the quality assurance scheme logo. The promotional activity in this regard will continue throughout the coming year.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payments scheme national reserve under categories B(i) and B(ii). Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and/or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. Investments can include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.</P>
        <P>More than 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity. The <Col N="699"/>Department of Agriculture and Food will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed and formal letters setting out the Department of Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s decision will be issued in the near future.</P>

	<P>An enabling provision to allow for the extension of our comprehensive beef labelling regulations to require operators in the hotel, restaurant and catering sectors to provide country of origin information to their customers on the beef they serve is at present before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Committee Stage of the Bill is due to be debated tomorrow.</P>
        <P>The Department is well advanced in drafting the necessary beef regulations and is currently in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the FSAI on the details including enforcement. While the regulations will then need to be submitted for EU approval, it is hoped that this process will not delay the making of the final regulations. In the meantime, the representative bodies for hotels, restaurants and pubs have agreed to recommend to their members to provide the information on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>I have also written to the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection requesting that consideration be given to extending the rules on country of origin labelling at EU level. I had raised the matter in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council some months ago. If this matter is not satisfactorily progressed at <Col N="700"/>EU level, I intend to bring forward proposals to extend the information that will be available to consumers here, on the origin of all meat they purchase.

	<P el="0">The person named submitted applications requesting consideration in respect of new entrant and inheritance measures of the single payment scheme. Following processing of his applications he was notified that his new entrant application was refused as he had no premia payments in the reference years from 2000 to 2002 and, therefore, he had not established entitlements in his own right. His inheritance application was not eligible as he had not received the holding by way of gift or inheritance as the lands were inherited by the mother of the person named. The applicant was informed in writing on 23 March 2005 that his mother should apply for the transfer of entitlements by inheritance.</P>
        <P>To date no application requesting transfer by way of inheritance has been submitted to the Department of Agriculture and Food. The Department forwarded another request on 24 January 2006 for the relevant inheritance application form to be completed and an application to subsequently transfer the entitlements to the <Col N="701"/>person named by private contract clause. Upon receipt and processing of these documents, the Department will be in a position to notify the person named of his entitlements in respect of the single payment scheme and arrange for the issue of payment if appropriate.</P>

	<P>The person named applied to consolidate his entitlements under the single payment scheme. His application has been processed and is eligible for consolidation. However, as the applicant has declared 1.6 hectares of potatoes on his 2005 single payment application form, a letter has issued requesting him to confirm whether or not he wishes to proceed with his consolidation application. This confirmation is required because, under the provisions of Article 51 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003, lands used for the production of potatoes and/or fruit and vegetables are not eligible to benefit from payment under the single payment scheme and the consolidated entitlements established in respect of these lands will immediately revert to the national reserve. Payment to the person named will issue when the completed confirmation form is returned to the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The protection of the Irish poultry industry is of critical importance in the face of a threat of an outbreak of avian flu. However, the <Col N="709"/>recent events in Turkey, including the sad deaths of a number of people, do not alter the risk of the disease being introduced into Ireland. The evidence is that the virus was introduced into Turkey by migrating wild birds and the human cases appear to have come from direct contact with infected poultry.</P>
        <P>While the Department of Agriculture and Food has introduced a range of measures particularly since last summer, aimed at minimising the risk of the introduction of avian flu into Ireland, we have not taken any specific additional measures in response to the most recent events in Turkey. However, when the initial outbreak was confirmed in Turkey last October, the European Commission extended the safeguard measures to Turkey, which involve a ban on the importation into the European Union of live poultry, most poultry products and untreated feathers.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is constantly reviewing its contingency arrangements with a view to minimising Ireland&rsquo;s exposure to avian flu and, based on a risk assessment, will introduce additional measures where this is considered appropriate. Such additional measures may, for example, require that all poultry be kept indoors if it is determined that there is a high risk of the introduction of highly pathogenic avian flu.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Food, has renewed an awareness campaign aimed at advising people travelling abroad, poultry flockowners, and employers of the measures they can take to help maintain Ireland&rsquo;s avian flu-free status. This campaign includes the placing of advice and information notices in the national newspapers, the use of travel advice posters in various languages at ports and airports and a detailed information booklet is being posted to every registered poultry flockowner in the country, containing information on the symptoms of the disease, biosecurity advice, advice for employers as well as advice on the cleaning and disinfection of poultry houses and vehicles. These measures, if followed properly, will all help to minimise the risk of introduction and spread of the disease and will play a key role in protecting the Irish poultry industry, should there be an outbreak.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is also working very closely with our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland on all matters of mutual concern in relation to avian flu, including the presence of a significant and intensive poultry industry on either side of the Border.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the wide range of measures taken and implemented by the Department of Agriculture and Food represents an appropriate response to the current level of risk. This is something which we keep under constant review and I will not hesitate to introduce such additional <Col N="710"/>measures as may be considered appropriate from time to time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">EU state aid approval has been sought from the European Commission for a revised farm waste management scheme to enable farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates directive.</P>
        <P>The proposed changes include: introduction of a standard grant rate of 60%, with 70% being available in the four zone C counties, for both animal housing and slurry storage &mdash; the current standard grant rate for such work is 40%; extension of the maximum income unit ceiling for farmers from 450 to 650 income units, with no upper limit being applied in the case of pig and <Col N="713"/>poultry farmers; increase in the maximum eligible investment from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding; removal of any minimum income requirement from farming from the scheme so all small farmers can participate in the scheme; extension of the scheme to include horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry and mushroom compost; introduction of a new 40% grant rate for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages, subject to a maximum eligible investment of &euro;80,000 in the case of decanter centrifuge systems and feeding systems for pigs and &euro;40,000 in the case of specialised slurry spreading tankers and related equipment; increase in the maximum eligible investment for standard mobile equipment from &euro;11,000 to &euro;15,000.</P>

        <P>While the person named established 72.72 standard and 7.34 set aside entitlements, the single payment scheme application form received on 15 May declared 72.61 forage hectares and 1.61 eligible hectares of set aside. He had also declared 5.73 hectares of forestry set aside, which does satisfy eligibility requirements for set aside but is not eligible for the set aside payment. Payment under the scheme, therefore, was based on 74.22 hectares and issued to the person named on 24 January 2006.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputies to my detailed answer on 14 December last to Question No. 288 regarding the increases in maternity and adoptive leave announced by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement of 7 December 2005. Draft orders providing for the increases were placed before both Houses on 18 January last and motions regarding resolutions on the draft orders are on today&rsquo;s Order Papers for the D&aacute;il and Seanad. While I cannot pre-empt the decision of the Oireachtas on this matter, I hope to be in a position to make the orders on 1 February 2006, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Social and Family Affairs, giving effect to the increases to employees who commence their maternity leave or additional maternity leave on or after 1 March 2006 and 1 March 2007 as the case may be.</P>
        <P>Under both the Maternity Protection Act 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act 1995, a person taking maternity or adoptive leave must give four weeks notice to their employer of taking such leave. It is, therefore, necessary for me to provide that the orders will take effect four weeks after they are signed into law in order to comply with the four week notice requirements under both Acts.</P>

	<P>All visa required non-national residents in Ireland who wish to leave the State and re-enter later are required to obtain a re-entry visa under the terms of the Immigration Act 2004 (Visas) Order 2005. Although the Schengen area of the European Union does not have a re-entry visa requirement, it is my understanding that some of the new member states do impose such a requirement. There is no provision for exit visas in Irish immigration law or practice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of the re-entry visa requirement was addressed in the discussion document, Immigration and Residence in Ireland, which I published in April 2005. It was proposed that the re-entry visa regime should be reviewed in view of the proposed developments in the visa service, in particular computerisation and the ongoing developments in the registration system operated by the Garda national immigration bureau, GNIB.</P>
        <P>The re-entry visa processing function has recently been transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Irish naturalisation and immigration service, INIS, which is an executive office in my Department.

	<P>In October 2004, the Government endorsed a joint proposal from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and from the Minister of State with responsibility for children to examine the scope for rationalising and restructuring the delivery of the State&rsquo;s services in the area of youth justice in accordance with the Children Act 2001. To this end, an internal project team was established charged with: conducting an overarching analytical review and scoping exercise, both nationally and internationally; consulting with stakeholders in the <Col N="718"/>governmental and non-governmental sectors; bringing forward recommendations for any necessary institutional reform.</P>
        <P>The report on the youth justice review, a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library, was examined in the social inclusion institutional framework last June. The Cabinet committee on social inclusion, CCSI, approved the thrust of the recommendations at that time. The CCSI agreed also that proposals on the legal and structural amendments necessary to give effect to the recommendations should be brought to Government before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>On 13 December last, the Government noted the youth justice report and approved its publication. The Government agreed also to implement the report&rsquo;s key findings, including the establishment on a non-statutory basis of a youth justice service as an executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the strategic direction of the new office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children. The remit of the new youth justice service is: to develop a unified youth justice policy; to devise and implement a national youth justice strategy; to manage all youth detention facilities;to manage the implementation of the Children Act 2001; to establish and administer national and local youth justice oversight arrangements.</P>
        <P>The new measures require the transfer of legal and administrative responsibilities for the detention of offenders under 18 years from the Department of Education and Science and from the Irish Prison Service. However, the educational ethos of the children detention schools will be retained within the new structures, with a greater emphasis on vocational training to cater for the broader age group.</P>
        <P>Other important elements agreed by Government include the establishment within the Health Service Executive of a parallel national management structure for children in need of special care and support. Responsibility for the continuation of educational services for young offenders in detention and the preparation of a global strategy on such services for all children in special residential accommodation will lie with the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The Government also approved the drafting of the official amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 necessary to give effect to the proposals arising from the youth justice report and from other related matters. I have circulated the proposed amendments to the Human Rights Commission, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.</P>
        <P>In a separate but extremely relevant decision last December, the Government established the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children within the Department of Health and Children. The new office brings together for <Col N="719"/>policy co-ordination purposes the relevant staff working on a range of functions in the Departments of Health and Children; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and Education and Science. The youth justice service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be located at the new office. The purpose in bringing various responsibilities together under one roof is to maximise the co-ordination of policies for children and young persons and to provide a strong focus in the strategic linkage of services for children and young people at the highest level.</P>
        <P>In establishing this new policy framework, the Government also approved the appointment of Ms Sylda Langford as director general of the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1064 to 1066, inclusive, and 1201 together.</P>
        <P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social and unlawful behaviour. The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard. Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. One of the provisions of the Act is to broaden the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which was originally introduced to combat under-age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of offences, such as a licensee supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and permitting disorderly conduct on the licensed premises.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. I have recently published the general scheme of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2005. The main purpose of the proposed Bill is to streamline and modernise our liquor licensing laws. It will also contain provisions which will combat anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>I recently published my legislative proposals to deal with anti-social behaviour, including provision for anti-social behaviour orders. I propose to introduce these proposals by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House. In so far as anti-social behaviour orders for children are concerned, my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children, has obtained Government approval for separate provisions relating to children to be brought forward as Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, as part of a package of measures concerning juvenile justice issues.</P>
        <P>In formulating the proposals my Department has, where the need arose, consulted with relevant Departments. In this regard, discussions have taken place with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding housing legislation in so far as anti-social behaviour is concerned.</P>
        <P>I take great satisfaction in the Government&rsquo;s decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 in 2006. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administra<Col N="722"/>tive duties but will be put directly into front line, operational, high visibility policing.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now better resourced than at any time in its history. The Garda funding which I secured in the Estimates for 2006 is at an historic high of over &euro;1.29 billion, and compares to just &euro;600 million in 1997. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 will be &euro;83.5 million, an increase of &euro;23 million on the allocation for 2005. This will greatly aid the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention. The &euro;83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and by special units throughout the State.</P>
        <P>I attach great importance to the development of a real partnership between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities on matters affecting policing. My intention and that of the Oireachtas, as set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, is that joint policing committees and local policing fora established under them will provide arenas where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities can co-operate and work together to address local policing and other issues.</P>
        <P>I will shortly issue guidelines for the establishment and operation of the committees after consulting my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. My view is that the best way forward is to establish a small number of joint policing committees on a pilot basis. Setting up a small number of pilot committees will give an opportunity to identify any teething problems that may arise when they are operating in practice. Any problems can then be addressed before the joint policing committees are rolled out to the remaining local authorities. I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement in this area in the near future.</P>
        <P>Last month I approved grant funding to 13 applications under the community based CCTV scheme. This initiative will allow communities to press ahead with their own local CCTV system. This scheme provides an ideal opportunity for communities to work with local garda&iacute; and their local authority with a view to improving the safety and well being of their area. CCTV has proved extremely successful in the prevention and detection of crime and is part of a series of measures aimed at tackling street assaults and public disorder.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they take a proactive approach to policing anti-social and public disorder issues by immediate intervention, arrest and prosecution or advice, as appropriate. Under the juvenile diversion programme, divisional juvenile liaison officers regularly visit schools, youth clubs and social services and give presentations under the education programme and highlight alternative options for reg<Col N="723"/>ular offenders. Community garda&iacute; and the Garda schools liaison officers also visit schools and address young people on a variety of topics, including anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>The concept of restorative justice provides for the bringing together of offenders and victims, which can also help to highlight the impact of anti-social behaviour, and other criminal behaviour, on victims and other members of the community. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are frequently in contact with other Government and non-governmental agencies, particularly the local authorities, to develop a multi-agency approach to addressing anti-social behaviour and public disorder and other issues by introducing by-laws regarding drinking in public places. These efforts will continue.</P>
        <P>There are currently 64 Garda youth diversion projects established nationwide. Garda youth diversion projects are a community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seek to divert young persons from becoming involved &mdash; or further involved &mdash; in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations. I am committed to the continuing development and, as resources permit, the expansion of Garda youth diversion projects. I have secured a budget of &euro;6.6 million for the projects and local drugs task force projects in 2006, which represents an increase of &euro;1.2 million for youth diversion.</P>
        <P>I intend to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to bring forward proposals for further community based initiatives in this area in light of the additional funding.</P>
        <P>A sub-group of the RAPID programme national monitoring committee was set up in the latter part of last year tasked with examining mechanisms to improve departmental/agency support and assisting RAPID areas in their response to tackling anti-social behaviour. This sub-group, which has commenced its work, comprises my Department, the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children, Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Pobal and F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>With regard to the implications of anti-social behaviour for accident and emergency services, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, informs me that a recently published report on alcohol and injuries in accident and emergency departments has indicated that a significant <Col N="724"/>number of patients who attended had an injury related to the consumption of alcohol.</P>
        <P>In so far as anti-social behaviour has a social impact, my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, informs me that under the current NAP/inclusion process, people experiencing urban poverty and rural disadvantage are identified as vulnerable groups, and targets have been set to tackle social exclusion in urban and rural areas marked by disadvantage. The objective is to create viable and sustainable communities with access to employment, adequate income and services. Key targets in this area include fostering public safety and crime prevention, ensuring the basic needs of all families are met through enhanced and better co-ordinated State support services, improving access to employment, health, education and housing for rural dwellers and improved transport services to rural dwellers. Progress on these targets is ongoing.</P>
        <P>Consultation for the 2006 to 2008 NAP-inclusion process was undertaken by the office for social inclusion at the end of 2005. Under the process, 78 written submissions were received and over 500 people participated in a number of regional seminars. The issue of anti-social behaviour was discussed during the consultation process, with participants agreeing that this issue affected both urban and rural areas. The input from the consultation process will inform future policy development as it will feed into the next NAP/inclusion process.</P>
        <P>In so far as anti-social behaviour impacts tourism, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, informs me that his Department is not aware of any survey suggesting recent changes in tourists&rsquo; perceptions of Irish towns and villages. It is understood that F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s visitor attitudes surveys consistently show that Ireland continues to deliver holidays that match, and in many cases exceed, the expectation of overseas holidaymakers, and that four in every five holidaymakers are very satisfied with the sense of safety and security in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In considering changes to the immigration system in the context of the proposed Immigration and Residence Bill, the areas of family reunification and residence status for migrants are being considered fully.</P>
        <P>At present there is no system of &ldquo;long-term resident&rdquo; or &ldquo;permanent resident&rdquo; in the Irish immigration system. A person can after a period of time obtain permssion to remain &ldquo;without con<Col N="725"/>dition as to time&rdquo;. I am, however, examining the possibility of introducing a new status of &ldquo;long-term resident&rdquo;. What is being considered is a new status whereby a person who has been legally resident in the State for a period of five years could apply for long-term resident status. The entitlements of long-term resident status would be greater than those of short-term or temporary residents and would in many respects be similar to those given to Irish citizens. A model which could be followed is that contained in the European Council directive on the status of long-term residents.</P>
        <P>The present position relating to the admission of family members to Ireland to join non-EEA nationals already here is as as follows. In all cases the person must be in a position to support his/her family without recourse to public funds. A non-EEA national who is not visa required and is working in the State on an employment permit or under the work authorisation scheme may apply for family reunification &mdash; spouse, minor child &mdash; immediately. A non-EEA national who is working in the State under the working visa scheme may be joined by his/her family &mdash; spouse, minor children &mdash; in the State after three months. A non-EEA national who is visa required and is working in the State on an employment permit may apply for family reunification &mdash; spouse, minor child &mdash; on condition that he/she has been working here for at least 12 months and is likely to remain so for a similar period, that is, the work permit has been renewed.</P>
        <P>I should point out that, as a matter of course, my Department reviews the situation regarding family reunification and residence status for migrants on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1075, 1076, 1082, 1084, 1086, 1087, 1091, 1108, 1120, 1149 and 1156 together.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;110,000 in respect of a national missing persons helpline made available by my Department in 2002 and 2003 was channelled through the Victim Support organisation and was in addition to the ongoing funding which that organisation received for the provision of services to victims of crime. This funding was provided subject to the conditions that no funding beyond the year 2003 should be implied and audited accounts should be provided to my Department on a calendar year basis. To date no audited accounts have been received in my Department.</P>
        <P>The Victim Support organisation received financial support from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from 1985 to 31 March 2005. Almost &euro;5.5 million had been made available over the five years up to 2005. In March 2005, I decided that continued funding of the Victim Support organisation could no longer be justified due to serious concerns relating to governance, accountability for public funds and poor service levels, after a lengthy period of instability within the organisation.</P>
        <P>The missing persons helpline was operated from the headquarters of Victim Support alongside Victim Support&rsquo;s own helpline for victims of crime. I understand that Victim Support Ltd. closed its headquarters operation during 2005 and a number of staff were made redundant, including the person employed to operate the missing persons helpline. My Department had no role in the decision of Victim Support Ltd. to make a number of its staff redundant, other than to insist that statutory requirements &mdash; notice, holiday pay and so forth &mdash; be met and the interests of the staff protected.</P>
        <P>Also in March 2005, I established a new commission for the support of victims of crime to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures. The commission is entirely independent in its decision making and <Col N="729"/>examines each application on its merits. The commission received an application from the Missing in Ireland Support Service for &euro;71,600 to establish, staff and operate a helpline for missing persons. After careful consideration of the application, the commission decided to offer funding of &euro;25,000. This offer was rejected by the Missing in Ireland Support Service. It should be borne in mind in this context that the commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime and that, while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most are not.</P>
        <P>It remains open to the Missing In Ireland Support Service to make an application to my Department for assistance if it so wishes. The missing persons bureau in Garda headquarters is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons. All cases of a person reported missing in suspicious circumstances remain open and under ongoing review and investigation until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At present, local Garda management takes direct responsibility for missing persons cases and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary. All missing persons are recorded on the PULSE system. When a person is reported missing, the local Garda superintendent takes direct responsibility for the investigation and will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, for example, the national bureau of criminal investigation or the technical bureau. The systems put in place by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to manage and deal with reports of missing persons are in line with best international police practice and Garda management is satisfied, and has assured me, that the systems in place are adequate to deal with any reported case of a missing person.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1078 and 1079 together.</P>
        <P>There is a comprehensive range of civil and criminal justice measures in place to tackle violence against women and the operation of the law in this area is kept under ongoing review. My Department chairs and provides the secretariat to the national steering committee on violence against women, NSC. The committee&rsquo;s remit is to provide a forum for the co-ordination of responses to violence against women and to develop a strategy and action plan which will build on the work achieved to date and chart progress for the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The membership of the national steering committee comprises representatives of the five  Departments and the key State bodies with a role in the area of violence against women and representatives of the relevant non-governmental organisations. The preparation of the new strategy has involved extensive consultation with interested parties as well as an evaluation of the working methods and structures of the NSC, with a view to further enhancing their effectiveness and laying down a workplan for the future. The strategic plan should be completed this year and it is expected to include a long-term strategy to raise awareness about violence against women.</P>
        <P>The provision of services to women experiencing violence, including domestic violence, rape and sexual assault, is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children, while the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for the provision of refuges and other emergency accommodation. A number of other Departments also have an involvement in responding to the problem of violence against women, including the Department of Education and Science as well as the Department of Community, Rural and Gael<Col N="731"/>tacht Affairs, which assists community groups dealing with the issue.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting that the Department of Social and Family Affairs provides funding through the Family Support Agency and that the community employment schemes assist by means of support staff at women&rsquo;s refuges. The findings of a sub-committee of the national steering committee on the question of funding for the sector generally are under consideration in the Departments with responsibility in the area.</P>
        <P>In addition to ensuring the necessary responses from the civil and criminal justice system, my Department is also responsible for preventative and awareness measures, including a number of intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence. Last year, the Department funded the evaluation of two such perpetrator programmes and the recommendations of the evaluation are currently being implemented. Furthermore, evaluation of a pilot project on domestic violence intervention in a particular area is nearing completion and the findings will also contribute to the development of departmental policy in this field.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I made an order on 12 December 2005 under the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 establishing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission. The Government decided on 13 December 2005 to nominate the following persons for appointment by the President to be members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission: Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh to be chairperson, Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Conor Brady.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the requirements of the Act, it will be necessary, in order that these persons may be appointed to be the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, for D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann to resolve to recommend them for appointment by the President. The necessary resolution in respect of this House is being considered today. Arrangements are being made for the necessary resolution in Seanad &Eacute;ireann to be brought before that House shortly.</P>
        <P>While I anticipate that the members of the ombudsman commission will be appointed very soon I do not expect that the ombudsman commission will become operational for some time. It will be a matter for the members of the ombuds<Col N="732"/>man commission, when appointed, to determine, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, how they intend to proceed with certain types of complaints. In addition, they will have to recruit and train their staff. I expect that it may take up to 12 months before the ombudsman commission will be in a position to start receiving complaints.</P>
        <P>The provisions governing the time limits for making complaints to the ombudsman commission are set out in section 84 of the Act. A complaint must be made within six months, beginning on the date of the conduct complained of. The section allows the ombudsman commission to extend the time limit for making a complaint if it considers that there are good reasons for doing so.</P>

	<P>The direct provision system seeks to ensure that the accommodation and ancillary services provided by the State meet the requirements of asylum seekers during the period in which their requests for asylum are being processed. In addition, a direct provision allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child was introduced some years ago and is paid by community welfare officers, operating under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, who also have the discretion to make once-off exceptional needs payments in special situations. The direct provision allowance seeks to reflect the value of the above mentioned services to the asylum seeker and I have no plans to alter the amount.</P>

	<P>An application for permission to remain in the State based on marriage to an Irish national was received from the person concerned in April 2005. Applications of this type, in fairness to all other such applicants, are dealt with in chronological order and currently take approximately 16 to 18 months to process. It should be noted that marriage to an Irish national does not confer an automatic right of residence in the State.</P>
        <P>A person who is awaiting a decision on a residency application based on marriage to an Irish national is free to leave the State at any time. A visa-required national must be in possession of a valid Irish visa to allow the person concerned travel to the State. As the person in question is a visa-required national, she would require a re-entry visa to return to the State. It is not the normal practice of my Department to assist persons <Col N="738"/>who do not have residency in the State with a re-entry visa prior to travelling except in certain emergency circumstances. Applications of this nature are considered on a case by case basis by the immigration division of my Department.</P>

        <P>I can advise the Deputies that in 2004, following a number of meetings between representatives of the Stardust victims committee and officials from my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a submission was presented to my Department on behalf of the victims committee. This submission was forwarded to the Garda Commissioner and the forensic science laboratory for examination as to whether it constituted &ldquo;new evidence&rdquo; or material otherwise not dealt with by the tribunal of inquiry. Both the Garda Commissioner and the forensic science laboratory responded to the Department stating that the report contained no new evidence.</P>
        <P>A meeting was subsequently held in November 2004 between the Stardust victims committee and the Secretary General of my Department. The committee was informed of the views of the Garda Commissioner and the forensic science laboratory and advised that in the absence of compelling new evidence, the establishment of a further tribunal of inquiry could not be recommended. It was, however, made clear to the delegation that any further submission they or their representatives wished to make would be carefully examined by the Department. To date no such submission has been received.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently received correspondence from one of the members of the committee which has been forwarded to the forensic science laboratory for observations.</P>

	<P>The directive in question is being implemented in Ireland via the existing national scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted, which is an administrative scheme laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and operated by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, CICT.

        <P Just="Left">Under the existing national scheme of compensation, persons who suffer criminal injury as a result of a crime of violence in this jurisdiction enjoy equal access to compensation regardless of their country of origin. As such, the scope of the Irish scheme is in fact already broader than required by the directive, which applies only to persons habitually resident in one of the member states. I can also advise the Deputy that the Commission has been informed that the CICT is the deciding authority for such claims in Ireland and also that it will act as the assisting authority for persons resident in Ireland who wish to transmit a request for compensation to the national schemes of other member states, as envisaged by the directive. Consideration is also being given to the introduction of an explicit reference in the text of the scheme to the directive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides for two methods by which non-nationals who are married to Irish citizens can obtain Irish citizenship. Non-nationals who are married to Irish citizens, who are Irish other than by marriage, naturalisation or honorary citizenship, can make a declaration of Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship following three years of marriage. This process was repealed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001, which came into effect on 30 November 2002. A transition provision in that Act, which allowed persons who married prior to that date to make a declaration, ended on 29 November 2005. A total of 2,622 persons who had lodged such declarations received certificates during 2005 confirming their Irish citizenship.</P>
        <P>Non-nationals who are married to persons who obtained Irish citizenship through the process of naturalisation can make an application for naturalisation following three years marriage and three years residence in Ireland. While records are not maintained in such a way which would identify the spouses of naturalised Irish citizens from other applicants, it is estimated that approximately 80 such persons received certificates of naturalisation in 2005.</P>

	<P>In June 1991, a Garda youth diversion project was established in Ballymun, Dublin 11 under the acronym BAY. The community based committee established a limited company, trading as BAY Limited, to act as a management agency to manage the project. In February 2003, this limited company was wound up and consequently the project closed.</P>
        <P>I understand that the community relations section of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently finalising negotiations with a new management agency to facilitate the establishment of a new Garda youth diversion project in Ballymun.</P>

	<P>The person in question made an application for permission to remain in Ireland under the revised arrangements announced by me on 15 January 2005, for the parents of Irish born children born before 1 January 2005. One of the requirements of these revised arrangements is that the applicant must have been continuously resident in Ireland with their Irish born child since its date of birth. Satisfactory evidence of this continuous residency must be supplied with each application. The application was made on 29 March 2005. The applicant was written to in both June 2005 and October 2005 and asked to provide satisfactory evidence of residency during the period March 2004 and April 2005. She did not provide satisfactory evidence of her residency in Ireland during this time and accordingly her application for permission to remain under the revised arrangements was refused.</P>

        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the legal position regarding a person not giving their name to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is as follows: section 24(2) of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 states that where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of the opinion that an offence has been committed under a relevant provision of the Act, the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may: a) demand the name and address of any person whom the member suspects, with reasonable cause, has committed, or whom the member finds committing, such an offence; b) arrest without warrant any such person who fails or refuses to give his name and address when demanded, or gives a name and address which the member has reasonable grounds for believing is false or misleading. Section 24(3) states that any person who fails or refuses to give his name and address when demanded by virtue of section 24(2) or gives a name or address which is false or misleading shall be guilty of an offence.</P>

	<P>The applicant applied to join his spouse in Ireland on a long-term basis. The visa application in question was refused by my Department at initial stage on 19 November 2005 on several grounds. First, the visa officer was not satisfied that an adequate relationship history existed prior to the marriage. Second, on the basis of documentation supplied in support of the application, there were insufficient finances available to support the spouse. It was also noted that the applicant had previously applied for and been refused a visa.</P>
        <P>The applicant&rsquo;s spouse had arrived in the State in 2000 and made an application for asylum. She subsequently sought and obtained residency solely on the basis of an Irish-born child.

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the total number of garda&iacute; allocated to the traffic corps as at 31 December 2005 was 570 &mdash; all ranks. While the members of the traffic corps are specifically dedicated to traffic duties, all garda&iacute; have responsibility, to deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with traffic duties as they arise.</P>
        <P>As a result of the Government&rsquo;s approval of my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, the Garda Commissioner will be in a position, as each cycle of recruit training is completed, to assign additional new members to the areas of greatest need with particular regard to certain priorities. These priorities will include the traffic corps. Between now and 2008, the traffic corps will increase its numbers to a complement of 1,200 on the following phased basis: 2006, 805; 2007, 1,030; and 2008, 1,200.</P>
        <P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in an Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, a total of 1,125 trainee garda&iacute; were inducted into the Garda College to commence training during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 <Col N="751"/>recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforce the law on cycling on footpaths on an ongoing basis. When traffic is heavy it is difficult for Garda motorcyclists and patrol cars to intercept offenders, and the most effective means of targeting this offence is through the use of Garda mountain bike units.</P>
        <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that breaches of the Road Traffic Acts 1961, as amended, are regularly targeted by way of various operations. Garda operations target specific localities for breaches of road traffic legislation, including cycling on footpaths. In addition, all Garda members enforce breaches of the traffic legislation as part of their normal duties. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that during the most recent Operation Freeflow this particular offence was targeted by personnel on the beat and mobile patrols, who had been directed to pay specific attention to pedal cyclists on footpaths and failure by cyclists to stop at red lights.</P>

	<P>I commissioned the auctioneering-estate agency review group in July 2004 to examine the licensing and regulatory requirements for property practitioners against a background of serious public concern regarding certain selling practices in the property industry. The <Col N="752"/>review group reported in July 2005 and made a number of recommendations aimed at protecting consumers from such practices as gazumping. It noted that it is sellers who gazump, and that, barring any changes to the law of contract, it will always be the right of the individual sellers to raise or lower their price demands or to withdraw their property from sale, and of buyers to reduce purchase offers or to back away from a purchase, up to the point where contracts have been signed by both parties and exchanged. In its report on gazumping &mdash; LRC59-99 &mdash; the Law Reform Commission, after extensive examination of the issue, concluded that &ldquo;the only practicable reforms are to take steps to inform buyers, and in that way, to protect them&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Following Government approval, I am proceeding to establish a new regulatory authority which will assume responsibility for the licensing and regulation of all auctioneering, estate agency, property letting and property management service providers. The new regulatory authority will have a consumer information function aimed at ensuring that consumers entering into contracts to purchase a property will do so fully understanding what rights and entitlements or otherwise are conferred on each party by the payment of a deposit. It will not have a function in relation to builders and property developers who are selling their own property. However, in the case of any auctioneer acting as agent in such transactions, it is intended that the regulatory authority will have an oversight function regarding the services they provide. It will also have a complaints mechanism for the public who have not achieved satisfaction through any existing mechanisms.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the issue referred to by the Deputy. The position is that former staff of Fort Mitchel Place of Detention have been temporarily assigned to both Cork and Limerick prisons since Fort Mitchel was closed on 10 February 2004. It has now become necessary to deploy those staff on a permanent basis in the context of the roll-out of the terms of the proposal for organisational change in the Prison Service, which was accepted by staff at ballot in August 2005, and in the context of the establishment of a dedicated prison service escort corps within the Prison Service which is an important element of the change programme.</P><Col N="753"/>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that the initial redeployment of the staff in question on a temporary basis was done in a manner which sought to minimise the disruption to the staff and their families. All of the staff were deployed within the Munster region, notwithstanding the demands of the service in other regions where there were pressing needs.</P>
        <P>As regards the rotation of staff between the Prison Service escort corps regional base in Cork and the Limerick regional base of the corps, the position is that this is a temporary arrangement which was sought by the staff as an alternative to the preferred option of the Irish Prison Service, which was to assign eight former Fort Mitchel staff to the Prison Service escort corps regional base at Limerick. The arrangement, which was put in place with effect from 19 January 2006, involves eight staff from the Cork regional base of the escort corps reporting for duty to the Limerick regional base of the corps each day. The need for such rotation will diminish and eventually be eliminated over time through natural wastage and the assignment of the requisite number of staff to the Limerick regional base of the escort corps from elsewhere in the service. In recent days, the number on rotation has already decreased to seven.</P>

When determining the budget allocations, the operational exigencies of regular and special policing operations, such as Operation Freeflow, which is intended to cater for the traditional motoring Christmas period, are taken into account. I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that, in general, as districts are allocated the overtime budgets on an annualised basis and not for specific operations, it is not possible to give a breakdown of the overtime hours for each major station over the past five years for the recognised Christmas period.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Kilkenny is one of the 11 remaining locations nationwide which form part of the Garda CCTV programme. As part of this programme, Garda town centre CCTV systems are to be implemented in the following locations: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated previously, I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest <Col N="757"/>extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.</P>
        <P>In recent months the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has conducted a thorough examination of all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems, including the installation, operation and management of CCTV systems; monitoring, recording and related activities; accommodation and situation of facilities and staff in regard to the town CCTV system and Garda station premises; assessment of civilianisation of Garda CCTV monitoring conducted under the management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and the most appropriate procurement model in terms of commercial viability and cost-effectiveness for the provision of town centre CCTV systems.</P>
        <P>I have recently received a comprehensive and innovative proposal for the project management and the outsourced service provision of 11 CCTV systems, including Kilkenny, from the Garda Commissioner. I have also approved a further six locations to be added to this project.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities wish to commence the initial public procurement process and I am also anxious to proceed urgently with this comprehensive request for tender to source the best CCTV service possible for Kilkenny and the other 16 locations selected. This will happen in conjunction with the imminent commencement of section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV in public places. My Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract the project managers and outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems.</P>
        <P>My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Kilkenny and in the other locations, at the earliest opportunity, subject to the limitations of compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.</P>

        <P>The person concerned subsequently, through his legal representatives, sought to be readmitted to the asylum process in accordance with the provisions of section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. The Deputy might wish to note that a stay was put on his deportation order while the request under section 17(7) was being considered and this stay remains in place even though that request under section 17(7) of the Act was refused. A further similar request, under section 17(7) to have the person concerned readmitted to the asylum process was received in my Department on 6 December 2005. This request has now been examined and, in recent days, a representative from my Department has responded to this request, refusing the request on the basis that no new evidence or information has been adduced that has not already been considered by the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as would add to the likelihood of the person concerned qualifying for asylum.</P>
        <P>The person concerned has served judicial review proceedings challenging decisions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and, as a result of these proceedings, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment on the case of the person concerned at this time.</P>

This ongoing operation is regularly reviewed to ensure the most effective and efficient use of resources.</P>
        <P>As section 7 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes clear, the function of the force is to provide policing and security services for the State, with the objectives of, <i>inter alia</i>, preserving peace and good order, protecting life and property, and preventing crime.

Garda resources are deployed by local Garda management based on an assessment of the situation pertaining locally and other policing requirements.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also maintains a crime prevention, criminal intelligence and road safety initiative role in the areas it patrols, which is incorporated in the Garda duty to monitor the situation at Corrib gas project sites so as to preserve the peace.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a Garda reserve and the Deputy will recall that the measure won widespread support in the House during the passage of the Act.</P><Col N="761"/>
        <P>The Act lays special emphasis on training for members of the Garda reserve. The Act further provides that the power to appoint persons to the reserve may only be exercised if the Commissioner has submitted proposals to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the training of persons to be appointed and regulations have been made concerning their recruitment, training and terms and conditions.</P>
        <P>In July 2005, the Garda Commissioner wrote to me proposing a Garda reserve with a strength of 4,000 members. I was supportive of the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposal and, as a first step, asked the Commissioner to recruit 900 reserve members by September 2006.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner is now drawing up proposals on the recruitment and training of reserve members and the duties they will be given. No doubt the Commissioner will study carefully the successful experience of volunteer police in the UK and other jurisdictions, where they provide important support for the regular police.</P>
        <P>When I receive the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals, I will engage in consultation with the Garda representative associations before bringing draft regulations to Government. I believe that there is significant public support for the concept of a Garda reserve. I also believe that the public will have confidence in the Garda reserve system that is implemented. I call on the Garda associations to engage positively in the consultative process.</P>
        <P>The reserve will supplement the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in policing local communities. It is not a replacement for garda&iacute;&mdash; as is proven by the increase, currently under way, in the strength of the force from 12,000 to 14,000.

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that in August last year prisons staff voted by a substantial majority to accept the revised proposal for organisational change in the Irish Prison Service, which, when implemented, will see the <Col N="762"/>elimination of overtime working in the Prison Service and its replacement with a new additional hours system. The new additional hours system, which is based on the concept of annualised hours, has been rolled out in ten institutions to date, including the Midlands and Portlaoise prisons. Accordingly, overtime is no longer being worked in those institutions. The new system will be rolled out in the remaining institutions on 12 February 2006, bringing about the total elimination of overtime working in prisons across the service.</P>
        <P>Under the new system, staff contract to work a fixed number of additional hours in the year and they are paid for those hours whether they are required to be worked, thereby encouraging smart working and generating benefits for both staff and management. Management will have staff available when they are needed most, while staff will have predictable attendance patterns and earnings. The net effect of the new system will be to reduce by more than half the level of hours required to be worked by staff over and above the normal working week.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 18 March 2004. The average processing time for such applications is 24 months at present. It is likely, therefore, that the case will be finalised in the next few months. I will be in touch with both the Deputy and the applicant when I have reached a decision on the matter.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in an Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>

Garda management further states that Garda personnel assigned to Garda stations in the Dublin metropolitan region are attached to uniform, detective, task force, special resource, mountain bike, community policing and drugs units. Resources are augmented from within each district or division, as required.

Local Garda management states that it is satisfied that there is no need to establish a new Garda sub-station on the south side of Mallow town as the current arrangements in place in Mallow are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. Garda management further state that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible service is provided for the public.</P>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, is charged with providing accommodation under the Government policy of direct provision for asylum seekers. Decisions regarding the opening, reclassification or closing of centres are made in the context of the overall demand for accommodation and the need to achieve value for money in the context of managing a very large property portfolio.</P>
        <P>Such management requires responses both to the changing numbers of persons seeking asylum and to the numbers of asylum seekers requiring accommodation from the RIA. A considerable number of asylum seekers have left RIA accommodation having been granted leave to remain in the State on the basis of having an Irish-born child. This exodus from RIA accommodation allied to the reduced number of persons seeking asylum requires RIA to engage in a major review of its accommodation needs. It is incumbent on the RIA to optimise overall service provision, make the best use of its accommodation resources and provide accommodation in a sensitive, balanced and proportionate way.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the RIA closed a number of centres. However, a more detailed examination of the accommodation needs is now required. To that end, the RIA is currently engaged in a major review of all accommodation centres throughout the State, including State-owned centres, in order to ascertain the most appropriate level of accommodation required by the RIA in the short to medium-term future.</P>
        <P>At this time, the RIA has made no decision on the future of the named, State-owned centres in Tralee and any such decision will be made in the context of an overall assessment of the accommodation needs of asylum seekers.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1165 to 1167, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I presume that the Deputy is referring to applications for leave to remain in the State made pursuant to section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. An application for leave to remain in the State in these circumstances arises where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is afforded three options: to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a deportation order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons a deportation order should not be made and temporary leave to remain in the State be granted instead. Leave to remain, outside that granted on the grounds of parentage of an Irish born child or marriage to an Irish or EU national, is considered in the context of deciding whether to deport a non-national.</P>
        <P>In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the 11 factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>, of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case, regardless of whether representations are <Col N="777"/>made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned. Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between those who have made an application for leave to remain and those who have not. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that many of those who failed the asylum process, and who did not opt to return voluntarily or consent to deportation, nonetheless left the State before a decision to deport or grant leave to remain was made.</P>
        <P>The figures in the following table refer to persons who received notification of intention to deport under section 3(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, but were subsequently granted temporary leave to remain in the State for an initial period of one year. The majority of these would have been persons who were refused refugee status in the State.</P>

Many of these persons would otherwise have been considered for leave to remain in the context of the deportation system described above. For example, in the case of the Irish-born child scheme initiated in January of last year, a total of 17,920 applications for leave to remain were received, of which, as of 31 December 2005, 16,800 have been granted.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1168 and 1169 together.</P><Col N="778"/>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a criminal conviction reflects a verdict of the courts. There is currently no provision for expunging a criminal conviction from either court or Garda records. With the introduction of the Children Act 2001, provision was made for a limited &ldquo;wiping of the slate&rdquo; in respect of most offences committed by persons under 18 once certain conditions have been met. This provision, which came into operation on 1 May 2002, limits as far as possible the effects of a finding of guilt, where those conditions have been met, by treating the person for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty or dealt with for an offence.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission, LRC, as part of its second programme for the period 2000-07 proposes to consider the longevity of criminal records and the expunging of certain offences. I understand that the LRC intends to prepare a consultation paper examining the issues surrounding the matter of spent convictions. I will consider any recommendations the commission may make on the matter.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, a Romanian national, arrived in the State on 27 May 1997 and applied for asylum. He withdrew his asylum application and lodged an application based on the parentage of a child born in the State. He was notified that his application for permission to remain in the State was refused because he did not form part of a family unit within the State with the child concerned or the child&rsquo;s mother. Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the person concerned was informed on 18 October 2001 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. Following consideration of the person&rsquo;s case file and representations submitted on his behalf, a deportation order was signed in respect of him on 2 August 2002.</P>
        <P>Following judicial review proceedings in relation to this deportation order, it was revoked on 13 June 2003. Fresh representations will be requested from the person concerned and these will be considered in conjunction with representations previously received.

	<P Just="Left">All applications for asylum in the State are processed in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996 and in particular having due regard to the definition of a refugee in section 2 of that Act, which states that a refugee is: &ldquo;a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it&rdquo;. However, this definition does not include a person who: (i) has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; (ii) has committed a serious non-political crime outside the State prior to his or her arrival in the State; or (iii) has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The task, therefore, in the case of each individual asylum seeker, is to determine whether, following investigation, he or she is deemed to come within the terms of that definition on the basis of all the information provided and on the basis of comprehensive country of origin information drawn from independent sources, such as the UNHCR.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A person seeking the status of refugee in the State may apply to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under section 8 of the 1996 Act for a declaration to the effect that such person is a refugee in accordance with the defini<Col N="780"/>tion as outlined. As provided for in the 1996 Act, the investigation of individual applications is carried out by two independent offices, namely, at first instance, by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, which makes a recommendation to the Minister as to whether an applicant should or should not be declared to be a refugee. An appeal by the applicant against a first instance recommendation is made to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT, which may affirm or set aside the recommendation.</P>
        <P>While the commission of crimes or breaches of the law in the State are not normally relevant to the asylum investigation by the two independent agencies, the issuing of a declaration by the Minister pursuant to a recommendation of ORAC or a decision of the RAT is governed by section 17 of the 1996 Act which, <i>inter alia</i>, provides for the Minister to take national security and public policy matters into account.</P>

	<P>The proposal for organisational change in the Prison Service which is currently being implemented across the prison system allows for delivery of a full range of services to prisoners and for the ongoing development of services for prisoners. The staffing and attendance arrangements will enable the introduction of a coherent training and development policy for all grades of staff in the Prison Service to ensure the availability of multi-skilled staff who can participate effectively in rehabilitative programmes. Furthermore, the industrial programme in the Prison Service, which provides structured vocational training to offenders enabling them to acquire certified skills and equipping them for gainful employment after their release, will be expanded and developed under the agreement.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the level of change comprehended by the proposal for organisational change in the Prison Service cannot be implemented overnight and that the timeframes agreed for implementing the various elements of the proposal must be respected. The new additional hours system, which is based on the <Col N="782"/>concept of annualised hours, has been rolled out in ten institutions to date and will be rolled out in the remaining institutions on 12 February 2006, bringing about the total elimination of overtime working in prisons across the service.</P>
        <P>It is not yet possible to indicate the amount, to be saved in overtime payments, which will be directly allocated to rehabilitation measures. When the new working arrangements have been rolled out fully and the savings envisaged have been realised, the question of further enhancing prisoner regimes will be considered in consultation with the Department of Finance. Any additional resources coming available may also be used to continue modernisation of prison facilities which would improve prisoner conditions.</P>

	<P>Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides a statutory basis for the operation of CCTV systems in public places by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and certain other bodies. The <Col N="783"/>provision outlines significant oversight powers for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the exercise of this function on behalf of the State. I am about to commence the provisions of section 38 of the Act, among others, and will shortly bring proposals to Government for the criteria to apply to community groups operating CCTV systems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware, I launched the community-based CCTV scheme last year in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems. The purpose of the scheme is to support local communities which wish to install and maintain CCTV security systems in their area, with the aim of increasing public safety and reducing the risk of anti-social and criminal activity. The scheme is designed to provide financial assistance for qualifying local organisations, towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems. The scheme is being managed, on behalf my Department, by Pobal, formerly Area Development Management Limited.</P>
        <P>In December 2005 I announced my decisions to provide grant aid assistance for a considerable number of groups throughout the country under the scheme. The payment of grant assistance to these groups will proceed shortly subject to the successful outcome of consultations involving the joint policing committee in the area in which each community-based system is located.</P>
        <P>Contract negotiations are under way between each successful applicant and Pobal, which will oversee and monitor this process, to ensure that the allocated funds will be spent on the purposes for which they are given and to ensure that normal accounting practices, relating to public funds, are adhered to. Books and records must be made available for inspection for the purposes of auditor verification visits if required. Detailed accounts of the expenditure of the grant will also be required. Groups will be required to provide six-monthly reports, including a declaration and breakdown of budget and balance.</P>
        <P>A code of practice for the community-based CCTV scheme, which sets out the basic conditions of use under the scheme, has been published and includes requirements on monitoring standards and compliance. Each successful applicant group or organisation has signed a declaration stating that it agrees to be bound by the CCTV code of practice and is subject to the Data Protection Acts and the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the scheme and for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1988, each local authority must undertake to act as the data controller. A manager or designated person will be nominated by the data controller in each instance. This individual will have responsibility for ensuring the proper, efficient and orderly day to day operation of the CCTV system. It is the responsi<Col N="784"/>bility of the data controller to ensure that there is full compliance with the code of practice. Contravention of a provision of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 may expose a person to prosecution under the Acts. The community-based group is required, at all times, to ensure the proper and responsible operation of the CCTV system under their control. This includes ensuring that all persons operating or monitoring the system are appropriately trained in the system&rsquo;s use and understand the restrictions and legal obligations imposed upon them and the need to maintain an appropriate record of the system&rsquo;s effectiveness.</P>
        <P>These CCTV systems will have to be installed to a high-end technical specification and operated in compliance with a strict code of practice. Access to the CCTV systems will also have to be given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required, thereby adding to the technical resources available to the Garda Commissioner in crime prevention and detection.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available, as objections, and the reason for such objections, by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the granting of bail are not captured on the crime recording system and would require the expenditure of an inordinate and unjustifiable amount of personnel hours to collate. The Garda authorities also inform me that the nationality of all offenders is not necessarily known, or recorded, at the time a bail application is being made. It is, therefore, not possible to provide statistics, on the basis of nationality, for persons who fail to honour bail.</P>

	<P>The policy for dealing with bullying in the Civil Service is set out in the revised policy document entitled, A Positive Working Environment: an Anti-Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying Policy for the Civil Service. This policy was circulated to all staff in my Department in August 2005 prior to the new code becoming effective on 1 September 2005. <Col N="787"/>My Department endeavours to resolve all allegations of bullying under the code, without the necessity of recourse to legal proceedings. I am aware of one case where legal proceedings have been initiated.</P>
        <P>The question of legislation in this area falls with the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. On this point, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently published the report of the expert advisory group on workplace bullying which made a number of recommendations including the possibility of introducing legislation in this area. It also recommended that new research be carried out to update the research compiled for the 2001 report of the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying.</P>

	<P>As I understand the question, I wish to confirm that no bonuses were paid to staff in my Department for the year ending 31 December 2005. My Department does, however, operate an exceptional performance awards scheme for staff below the grade of assistant secretary. The total amount available for payment of awards cannot exceed 0.2% of the Department&rsquo;s payroll from the sanctioned subheads. Individual and group awards may be made in respect of genuinely exceptional performance where regard is had to the nature and quality of the activities involved and to the circumstances under which they are carried out. Particular regard is paid to the grade level of the staff member concerned and where the work is considered to be over and above the high quality performance normally expected of such grades. While the figures for 2005 are not collated as yet it is likely that the average individual award would be less than &euro;100.</P>
        <P>Assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries are covered by a separate scheme of performance related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, available on the website <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, with her child, arrived in the State on 25 February 2005 and applied for asylum. Their application was refused following consideration of their case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 22 August 2005 that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her child and afforded them three options under <Col N="789"/>section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely, to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, to leave the State voluntarily or to consent to the making of deportation orders. No representations were received from or on behalf of the person concerned by the due date. Their case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>.</P>
        <P>On 27 September 2005, deportation orders were signed in respect of the person concerned and her older child. The existence of another child born in the State on 5 August 2005 was only made known to my Department on 12 September 2005 by officials from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Following consideration of late representations for leave to remain in the State, the deportation orders in this case were affirmed. The legal representative of the person concerned was notified to this effect by letter dated 10 October 2005.</P>
        <P>Notice of the deportation orders was served by registered post requiring the family to present themselves to the Garda national immigration bureau, GNIB, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on Thursday, 6 October 2005, in order to make arrangements for their deportation from the State. The family presented as required and were given a further presentation date of 13 October 2005. The family failed to present themselves on that occasion and were classified as &ldquo;evaders&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In addition to the 11 factors contained in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, I must also have regard to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>, before making a deportation order. The safety of returning a person, or <i>refoulement</i> as it is referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether to make a deportation order. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to Nigeria and other third countries.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that applications for asylum and leave to remain in the State of the person concerned, together with all <i>refoulement</i> issues, were comprehensively and fairly considered and, as such, their deportation should proceed. To this end, I urge the person concerned to come forward and present herself to the GNIB as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains provisions relating to persons travelling to and from this jurisdiction. Persons who have been convicted of sex offences outside the jurisdiction are subject to the notification requirements of the Act when, at the time of the conviction or thereafter, they become resident for a qualifying period in the State. Furthermore, a person subject to the notification requirements of the Act who leaves the State for an intended continuous period of seven days or more at a time must inform the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in advance of leaving. If the person, when leaving, did not intend to remain outside the State for a continuous period of seven days, but does, she or he must so inform the Garda S&iacute;ochana within a further seven days. These provisions cover persons travelling between the State and Northern Ireland.</P>

A memorandum of understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, relating to sex offenders has been negotiated by my Department and the Home Office, and I will shortly seek Government approval for its signature.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent criminal justice review of Northern Ireland, an intergovernmental agreement on North-South co-operation on criminal justice matters was signed on behalf of the Irish and British Governments in July 2005. One of the items included in the work programme for the first year is the establishment of a working group to review the arrangements for exchanging information on registered sex offenders.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the working group of officials to implement the agreement took place in Dublin in November 2005. The meeting agreed to the establishment of a registered sex offenders advisory group. This group will evaluate the potential for sharing information, including potential benefits and barriers, and will identify areas for future co-operation. The group will consist of representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, my Department and the Northern Ireland Office. The advisory group will report to the next meeting of the working group of officials which is scheduled to take place in March. Following that, officials will <Col N="792"/>make recommendations to Ministers in both jurisdictions for future action.</P>

	<P>Applications for visas, including visitor visas, are received in Irish embassies and consulates abroad. Under a delegated sanction arrangement, most visas are granted by Department of Foreign Affairs personnel without reference to Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Only the more problematic types are referred to Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Dublin for decision. Special arrangements apply in Moscow, Beijing and New Delhi where dedicated visa officers process all visa applications.</P>
        <P>My Department has statistical information from May 2005 on visit visas referred for decision to Dublin. The offices in Beijing and Moscow also provide statistics for my Department on a monthly basis. The recently established office in New Delhi will do likewise in the future.</P>

	<P>Procurement activity in my Department continues to be managed in accordance with established public sector guidelines. The requirement to produce an annual corporate procurement plan arises from the national public procurement policy framework, which was issued by the Department of Finance in May 2005. In response to that, my Department has undertaken steps to produce a corporate procurement plan in 2006 which will seek to evaluate existing approaches to procurement, set future goals and <Col N="793"/>develop indicators to evaluate practical procurement reform outcomes.</P>
        <P>My Department, with others, has participated in a capacity building exercise run by the national public procurement policy unit of the Department of Finance, in line with its role as a resource for the roll-out of procurement management reform in the public sector generally.</P>

	<P>On 13 December 2005, the British National Central Bureau of Interpol issued a communiqu&eacute; to all Interpol member states, including Ireland, signalling changes in British vetting procedures. The nature of these changes would have the potential to create significant difficulties for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in submitting requests for vetting to the British authorities. Accordingly, high level contact is occurring between the Garda authorities and their British Interpol counterparts with a view to reaching a satisfactory resolution of the potential difficulties.</P>

        <Quest>if the decision to move asylum seeking people from the town of Kiltimagh to Ballyhaunis and Sligo will be reconsidered in view of the fact that the children of these people are in the mid-term of their school year; if only an absolutely necessary move will be made and only when the academic school year is complete.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, is charged with providing accommodation under the Government policy of direct provision for asylum seekers. Decisions regarding the opening, reclassification or closing of centres are made in the context of the overall demand for accommodation and the need to achieve value for money in the context of managing a very large property portfolio.</P><Col N="794"/>
        <P>Such management requires responses both to the changing numbers of persons seeking asylum and to the numbers of asylum seekers residing in RIA centres. A considerable number of asylum seekers have left RIA accommodation having been granted leave to remain in the State on the basis of having an Irish born child. This exodus from RIA accommodation allied to the reduced number of persons seeking asylum requires RIA to engage in a major review of its accommodation needs. It is incumbent on the RIA to optimise overall service provision, make the best use of its accommodation resources and provide accommodation in a sensitive, balanced and proportionate way.</P>
        <P>The RIA is currently engaged in a major review of all accommodation centres throughout the State in order to ascertain the most appropriate level of accommodation required by the RIA in the short to medium term future. The review will inevitably require the RIA to close centres and to reclassify some centres for accommodation for single persons.</P>
        <P>The RIA is aware that the necessary adjustments to its accommodation portfolio will result in disruption for some residents and endeavours to keep such disruption to a minimum. In the case of Kiltimagh, the RIA is examining the possibility of facilitating the continued residence at the centre of families with school-going children, as far as practicable.</P>
        <P>The agency operates several regional centres with pre-school facilities for small children. Any families choosing to move from the centre who have pre-school children will be offered accommodation at one of those centres.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Every effort is made to provide a high visibility presence throughout the country&rsquo;s towns and villages. Garda management states that uniform and detective units and divisional traffic corps, supplemented by community policing units and Garda mountain bike units &mdash; all of which provide a highly visible local presence &mdash; continue to police the community and to take a proactive approach to addressing anti-social and public disorder issues by way of immediate intervention, arrest and prosecution, or advice as appropriate.</P><Col N="799"/>
        <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are in frequent contact with other Government and non-government agencies, particularly local authorities, in order to facilitate a multi-agency approach to addressing criminal issues including anti-social behaviour and public disorder, such as the introduction of by-laws regarding drinking in public places. This liaison will continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recently I also announced that the Commissioner is reserving &euro;5 million of his &euro;83.5 million overtime budget in 2006 for an extension of Operation Encounter which is an ongoing public order and visible policing initiative. In this stepped-up programme, garda&iacute; will be more intensively deployed on foot and cycle patrols at areas where there are major movements of people such as schools, shops, major traffic intersections and so forth.</P>
        <P>The timescale for achieving a record Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in an Agreed Programme for Government, remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. This phased increase in force strength will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. These will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and significant public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to increase significantly the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing where they will make a real impact.</P>

	<P>The policy for dealing with bullying in the Civil Service is set out in the revised policy document entitled, A Positive Working Environment: an Anti-Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying Policy for the Civil Service. This policy was circulated to all staff in my Department in August 2005 prior to the new code becoming effective on 1 September 2005.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, my Department&rsquo;s personnel division has dealt with ten cases formally referred for investigation under the policy. The cases variously refer to allegations of harassment, sexual harassment and bullying. Central, however, to the operation of the policy is the principle that all allegations are dealt with confidentially. It is not therefore, possible to give further information as to do so would risk identifying the parties involved. All complaints are taken seriously and investigated fully in accordance with the guidelines set down in the policy.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it has not been possible to collate this information in the time available. I will, however, arrange for the information to be forwarded directly to the Deputy in the next few days.</P>

        <P>In regard to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign of 1,100 Garda recruits each year to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in an Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.

	<P>The following tables provide the total offences for the ten headline offences groups recorded and detected in the Garda districts of Baltinglass, Carlow, Naas and Kildare for the years 2001 to 2005.</P>
        <P>The figures provided for 2005 are provisional, operational and liable to change.</P>
        <P>The PULSE computer system to record crime figures was introduced in 1999. As with the introduction of any new system it took time before users were fully competent in its use. Senior management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has stated that since its introduction a more accurate base year to use is 2002.</P>
        <P>Any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In the year up to 30 September 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there was the equivalent of 24 crimes per 1,000 of the population. </P><Col N="801"/>

        <P FLI="0">Garda divisional boundaries do not correlate with county boundaries.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are constantly monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided for the public.</P>
        <P>Garda management states that when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Carlow-Kildare Garda division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. In this context I should mention that the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in an Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>

	<P>The question of introducing a road safety and driver education syllabus into schools <Col N="807"/>has been examined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on foot of a report from a task group set up in 2000 and which included representatives of the Department of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Safety Council, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, Rosary College Crumlin, the CCEA Northern Ireland and the NCCA. The NCCA also commissioned a study of driver education in post-primary schools from Dr. Ray Fuller of Trinity College Dublin.</P>
        <P>The NCCA, whose role is to advise the Minister for Education and Science on curriculum and assessment issues, recommended that road safety be addressed within the context of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and that driver education, and specifically learning to drive for pupils aged 17, should not become part of the school curriculum. The NCCA noted that this concurred with the practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>At the start of the 2001-02 school year the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive &mdash; a road safety resource for transition year and the senior cycle &mdash; to all second level schools. This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users. A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack, with copies of the Rules of the Road. In the preparation of the Staying Alive resources material, views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety. Prior to its issue to second level schools, the material was piloted in 20 schools and the response from teachers in those schools was very positive.</P>

        <Quest>the situation regarding the decentralisation programme to Mullingar; if progress has been made in regard to the sourcing of a suitable property for the transfer of her Department; the number of Departmental staff listed as willing to transfer to Mullingar; her plans for a preliminary relocation of some staff to facilitate the smooth transfer of her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Issues relating to property and accommodation for the overall decentralisation programme are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, OPW. I understand that the OPW is engaged in the process of site acquisition for <Col N="808"/>Mullingar but that the matter has not yet been concluded.</P>
        <P>The data available to my Department on individuals wishing to decentralise to Mullingar relate to applications made through the Central Applications Facility, CAF, on or before 7 September 2004 indicating Mullingar as a first choice of location. Several new entrants who have undertaken to relocate to Mullingar on decentralisation have also been assigned to my Department. The total number involved in these categories is 59. In addition, there are 122 external CAF applicants in respect of the decentralisation of my Department to Mullingar. Applications may still be made through the CAF and the position is liable to change on an ongoing basis.</P>

        <Quest>the reason that the advertised post for a temporary teacher required for a special school in County Mayo from 1 September 2005 was filled by a teacher who did not have the training and experience in working with visual and hearing impaired children specified as necessary in the advertisement; the further reason a temporary teacher with eight years&rsquo; experience in the school and the training and experience in working with visual and hearing impaired children was rejected for the post; the further reason that the fourth paragraph of section six of the regulations governing the appointment and retention of teachers in primary schools for the school years 2005-06 was ignored.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the recruitment and appointment of staff rests with the board of management of the school concerned subject to my Department&rsquo;s rules and guidelines governing the appointment and retention of teachers in schools. These rules state that a fully qualified primary teacher must be appointed to all vacancies arising in schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy should note that the fourth paragraph of section six of the regulations governing the appointment and retention of teachers in primary schools for the school year 2005-06 has not been ignored in this case as it appears that the school has appointed a fully qualified primary teacher. It is my understanding that the person referred to by the Deputy is not recognised by my Department as a qualified primary school teacher.</P>
        <P>With regard to teacher training, the Deputy may be interested to know that my Department established the special education support service which is based at Cork Education Centre in September 2003. The aim of the service is to enhance the quality of teaching and learning with particular reference to the education of children with special needs. The service provides support for school personnel working with pupils and <Col N="809"/>students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings including special schools and special classes. Professional development and support is available to principals, middle management in schools, class teachers, subject teachers, special-class teachers, resource teachers and special needs assistants.</P>
        <P>It is open to the management authorities in schools to address any additional training needs for staff employed in their schools through the special education support service.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the statement regarding the industrial and reformatory school system referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. I can also confirm that this statement was provided in its entirety for the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse in June 2003. My Department, however, has no record of the meeting on 18 March 1988 to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>In regard to allegations of fraud, I can confirm that audit investigations were made in 1988 and a more comprehensive audit and evaluation took place between 1991 and 1994. Certain matters which came to light during the course of the comprehensive audit were reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in December 1992 and the Revenue Commissioners in July 1993. As a result of irregularities which came to light, a member of the staff of Trinity House school was suspended from duty in November 1992. The detailed Garda investigation into alleged fraud at Trinity House failed to disclose any primary evidence to support a criminal charge.</P>

	<P>The enrolment of pupils, including pupils with special educational needs, is a matter in the first instance for schools, parents and guardians. The Education Act 1998 requires all schools to have in place an admissions policy, detailing admission to, and participation by, students with disabilities or who have other special educational needs. The Act also requires schools to ensure that as regards that policy the principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents&rsquo; choice are respected.</P>
        <P>My Department provides a range of supports for all schools to enable them to welcome students with special educational needs. My Department allocates additional teacher support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and VECs to cater for students with special educational needs. The nature and level of support provided in each case is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual student.</P>
        <P>The level of resources being made available to support students with special educational needs in the second level system has grown significantly in recent years. In the current school year, my Department has allocated approximately 1,639 whole-time equivalent teachers and 1,082 special needs assistants to second level schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs. This represents an increase of approximately 250 teaching posts and 450 special needs assistant posts on the previous school year.</P>
        <P>Under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over key functions from my Department in regard to special educational provision. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of <Col N="811"/>major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>My Department has not undertaken a survey of schools in relation to the provision of speech therapy services. The provision of therapy services for people with disabilities, including speech therapy, is a matter for the Health Service Executive, HSE to which funding is provided for such purposes. My Department does not employ speech therapists for the delivery of speech therapy services to schools or determine the children <Col N="812"/>who should receive these services. In the circumstances, the provision of speech therapy should be raised with the local HSE office by the school in question.</P>

	<P>My Department is fully aware of the need to provide a solution for the long-term accommodation needs of the school to which the Deputy refers and is actively considering two options. One option is the provision of a new school on a greenfield site. This matter is being pursued by the property management section of the Office for Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in regard to site acquisitions generally. The second option, which could offer a better value for money solution, involves rationalisation of existing providers in the area. While agreement in principle to this proposal has been received in my Department discussions are ongoing regarding the practical delivery of this accommodation solution.</P>

	<P Just="Left">With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. The SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made. My officials have confirmed that the school authorities have been in contact with the local SENO regarding an application for resource teaching support only. There is no indication of an application for a special needs assistant and assistive technology support for the pupil to whom the Deputy refers.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1222 and 1225 together. Under the staffing schedule for primary schools, an enrolment of 12 recognised pupils at the end of September 2004 is required for the employment of a principal and one mainstream classroom teacher. However, the provisional enrolment figures, which have been submitted to my Department, indicate that a minimum of 12 recognised pupils were enrolled in several schools which have one teacher and, on this basis, the schools concerned would qualify for the appointment of a mainstream teacher in 2006. Following detailed consideration of the position of these schools, I am pleased to inform the Deputies that, as an entirely exceptional matter, I decided that a mainstream class teacher may be appointed in those schools immediately rather than with effect from 1 September 2006 which is the position which would normally apply in these circumstances and the boards of management of the schools concerned were notified accordingly. A detailed review of the position of the 13 one-teacher schools with fewer than 12 pupils enrolled on 30 September 2004 is being undertaken and will be completed as speedily as possible.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. The statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The safety statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.</P>

	<P>My Department makes a specific ex-quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance to schools in the second level system. This allocation is based on the pupil enrolment in September of the preceding school year. As a result of my decision to allocate an additional 100 posts to guidance from September 2005 an enhanced guidance allocation provision was put in place for the 2005-06 school year. As a result for schools in the free education or block grant schemes, the level of allocation ranges from eight hours per week for schools with enrolments <Col N="819"/>below 200 pupils to 47 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. In addition, certain schools which had been allocated hours in response to particular needs or as part of the guidance enhancement initiative, have been permitted to retain this higher allocation for the 2005-06 school year.</P>
        <P>In the case of schools outside the free education or block grant schemes, 11 hours per week are allocated in respect of schools in the 350-499 enrolment category and a full post is allocated in the case of schools with 500 or more pupils. My decision to allocate 100 additional posts to enhance existing provision reflects the importance which I attach to the area of guidance.</P>

	<P>Officials from the special education section of my Department meet their counterparts in the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on a regular and ongoing basis to discuss issues of mutual concern. However, no recent meeting involving the HSE, south east area, has taken place regarding the matters to which the Deputy refers and there has been no request for a meeting to discuss such matters with the special education section. If it is the case, however, that the HSE, south east area, has concerns of the nature described by the Deputy, it should write directly to my Department outlining the exact nature of those concerns. Once such information is received I will ensure that it receives attention from the appropriate areas of my Department.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the work undertaken by the partnership and recently received a copy of its objectives and work plan for 2005-06. These documents have been forwarded to my Department&rsquo;s social inclusion unit. The partnership has received support from my Department since 2004 through the secondment of a primary school teacher, on a full cost recoupment basis, to work with the partnership as a full-time education officer.</P>
        <P>A key focus of the Government&rsquo;s education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, the new action plan for educational inclusion, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young <Col N="821"/>people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed.</P>
        <P>A key element of DEIS is putting in place a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools for the purposes of qualifying for resources, both human and financial, according to the degree of disadvantage experienced. This standardised system will replace all of the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage. This process is being managed by the educational research centre on behalf of my Department, and is being supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through my Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, which involved a new survey of all mainstream primary schools conducted by the centre in May 2005 and the updating by them of existing data sources on the levels of disadvantage in second level schools, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban or town, and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme. This will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters or communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. The identification process is nearing completion and we anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools shortly.</P>

        <P>The mainstream teacher allocation of all primary schools, including one-teacher schools, is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The staffing schedule is outlined in a circular which is issued annually to all primary schools. In addition such schools may be eligible for additional teacher or special needs assistant allocations in accordance with the criteria for the allocation of special needs resources.</P>
        <P>Sections 14, 15 and 23 of the Education Act 1998 assign each board of management and principal teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of schools at both primary and post-primary level. Principals should organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of pupils during school hours. In particular, they should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch-breaks, assembly and dismissal.</P>
        <P>Rules 121(4) and 124(1) of the rules for national schools and section 23(2) of the Education Act 1998 oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are on school premises, during school time and-or on school activities. Accordingly, the responsibility of all teachers individually and collectively to provide for a duty of care at all times towards the pupils in the school in which they teach, including periods of supervision, remains. Special needs assistants, who may be assigned to schools to cater for pupils with significant care needs, may be required to assist such pupils, if appropriate.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. The statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The safety statement should be reviewed regularly.</P>
        <P>A detailed review of the position of one-teacher schools with fewer than 12 pupils enrolled on 30 September 2004 is being undertaken and will be completed as speedily as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1258 and 1232 together.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, insert additional institutions in the Schedule to the Act. For an institution to be considered under section 4, it must be an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a children&rsquo;s home, a special school for children with a physical or intellectual disability, or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness. It must also be one in which children were placed and resident, <Col N="825"/>and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <P>The case in question concerns the Regina Coeli hostel which provided shelter for homeless women, mothers with young children and expectant mothers. However, as such hostel facilities do not come within the scope of section 4 of the Act, it is not open to me to consider the inclusion of this institution in the Schedule. The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Government Departments and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule.</P>
        <P>The Children Act 1908 was an Act to consolidate and amend the law on the protection of children and young persons. It also provided for the recognition of reformatory and industrial schools and for sanctions to be imposed relating to offences concerning children and young people. Many of the sections of this Act have since been amended by a number of more recent Acts. Part IV of the Act deals with the certification and management of industrial and reformatory schools. However, as the Regina Coeli hostel does not come within the description of either an industrial or reformatory school, it does not appear that the 1908 Act can be of assistance in this case.</P>

These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees&rsquo; scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for post leaving certificate courses 2005, grants are available to eligible candidates who are entering approved PLC courses for the first time in the 2005-06 academic year. Candidates are ineligible if they already hold a FETAC level 5 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC <Col N="826"/>(NCVA) level 2 qualification, a FETAC level 6 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) level 3 qualification, or a third level qualification at level 6 or higher.</P>
        <P>However, notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a qualification no higher than FETAC level 5, formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) level 2 qualification, and are now pursuing a course that offers progression, may be deemed eligible for grant aid.</P>
        <P>Under the scheme, a grant is tenable for the normal duration of the approved PLC course and is renewable annually subject to the satisfactory participation, attendance and the approval of the vocational education committee. A record of achievement is generally issued in respect of individual modules of a course, whereas a full award &mdash; FETAC level 5 formally known as a FETAC (NCVA) level 2 qualification, a level 6 qualification, formally known as FETAC (NCVA) level 3 qualification &mdash; is issued were all modules of a particular course have been successfully completed.</P>
        <P>My Department understands that the candidate referred to by the Deputy has previously pursued an approved PLC course at FETAC level 5. However, she did not attain the terminal qualification on completing the course. In the circumstances she may not be deemed as progressing under the terms of the of the PLC scheme.</P>

        <Quest>her proposals to expand education facilities in existing primary and post <Col N="830"/>primary schools in County Louth, in view of the significant growth in population particularly in Drogheda, Dundalk and Ardee; if she intends to build new primary and secondary schools in County Louth; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is aware that the population of County Louth continues to increase and that this is causing some strain on existing educational provision at primary and post-primary level. However, my Department has undertaken a number of measures to address the current and future need for pupil places in this area in general and in the areas referred to by the Deputy in particular.</P>
        <P>In this regard, at primary level, extensions were recently provided at Walshestown NS, Tullyallen NS, Scoil Mhuire in Muchgrange, and Scoil Mhuire Gan Sm&aacute;l in Cartown. In addition a new 32 classroom school has been approved for Drogheda and major extensions have been approved for Ardee Monastery NS, Scoil Mhuire na nGael Dundalk and St. Buite&rsquo;s NS Tenure. A new school building has also been approved for Mell NS Drogheda.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level, an extension to Scoil U&iacute; Mhuire Dunleer is currently under construction and extension projects at Drogheda Grammar School and Dundalk Grammar School are in architectural planning. All of these initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrates my Department&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned.</P>
        <P>My Department has also had discussions with Louth County Council which has appointed consultants to draw up a master plan for three new residential neighbourhoods as identified under the local area plan for north Drogheda environs 2004. My Department received draft working papers on the planning strategy for this master plan and officials subsequently met with the local authority to discuss the plan. Following this, my Department corresponded with the local authority outlining its initial assessment of educational requirements at both primary and post-primary level for the area based on a proposal in the plan to deliver up to 7,500 new houses over the next ten to 15 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department also received correspondence from Dundalk Town Council with regard to a proposed development plan for the south-west sector of Dundalk. This correspondence outlined proposals for the development of three areas of residential development comprising of some 7,300 units. As a result my Department outlined its initial assessment of educational requirements for this area based on the proposed development. The next stage in this process is the preparation of a draft development plan by the local authority which my Department will be commenting on when available.</P><Col N="831"/>
        <P>Apart from this, as the Deputy will also be aware, a new school planning model involving published area development plans is being piloted in five areas over the current school year. Drogheda is included in the pilot scheme as part of an overall plan for the north Dublin/east Meath and south Louth area. The need for additional primary and post-primary schools in the area will be further considered in this context.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.</P>
        <P>The draft plan for north Dublin/east Meath and south Louth is nearing completion in the school planning section of my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1251 to 1255, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am most anxious that children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders or ASD, receive an education appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department provides the following dedicated facilities for the education of children with autism including the area in question. Some 159 special classes for children with autism, attached to special schools and mainstream schools, have been created. Fifteen pre-school classes for children with autism have been established. Five special classes for children with Asperger's syndrome have been established. Furthermore, my Department sanctions home tuition grants for children with autism for whom a home-based <Col N="835"/>ABA programme is considered appropriate or in cases where such children are awaiting an appropriate school placement.</P>
        <P>In addition to the provision outlined above, my Department is currently funding 11 autism specific facilities that are operating on a pilot basis. Some of these facilities provide an applied behavioural analysis, ABA, model of response, which is one of a range of models of approach to the education of children with autism. Approval has also been given for the establishment of a further three such facilities.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for all children, including children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools. My Department would also support an eclectic approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are used, for example, treatment and education of autistic and related communication handicapped children, TEACH, ABA, picture exchange communication system, PECS, etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the preferred approach of my Department is to provide appropriate provision through the recognised primary and post-primary school network, it will continue, in conjunction with the National Council for Special Education, to consider applications that may be received for the establishment of futher stand alone autism facilities. These applications will be carefully examined and considered on a case by case basis and account will be taken of a number of factors, such as the availability of appropriate school based provision in a particular area, before any decisions are made.</P>
        <P>With regard to the request for the facility referred to by the Deputy, I must point out that many of the children in question are already enrolled in special classes for children with autism that have been established in primary schools.</P>
        <P>The NCSE is currently progressing the application and my Department is liaising with it in this regard. The matter of approval for this facility or sourcing accommodation can only be considered when this process has been fully completed.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of the task force on autism provide an invaluable basis for the development of educational services and supports for persons with autism. However, in responding to the recommendations, my Department has had to give priority to a number of key areas before detailed individual recommendations can be addressed. These key areas involve the implementation of the core legislative and structural measures required to underpin service development and delivery. This approach is critical to the implementation of many of the individual recommendations of the task force including those concerning assessment, parental involvement, service <Col N="836"/>delivery, information dissemination, promotion of inclusion and co-ordination between health and education authorities.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the NCSE, is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with autism and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.</P>
        <P>The enactment of the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act and the establishment of the NCSE have provided the key to underpin service delivery in the future.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>the number of schools in Sligo which run the stay safe programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of child protection and ensuring that all children in every primary school are aware of child protection issues are high priority areas for my Department.</P>
        <P>The Stay Safe programme is a personal safety programme for children. It is designed to give children the knowledge and necessary skills to help them deal with potentially abusive or threatening situations. However, it is also recognised that the programme must cover those individuals closely involved with children on a daily basis, namely parents/guardians and teachers. To this end, professional in-service courses for teachers and parent awareness seminars have been put in place at individual school level. This is in addition to the teaching of a personal safety skills programme to pupils.</P>
        <P>The training of teachers, parents and boards of management in the Stay Safe programme and the development of guidelines and procedures for a school policy on child protection are provided by a network of 31 regionally-based teachers who are available to the programme on a part-time basis. This support supplements the assistance provided by the Department of Health and Children which maintains an administrative office for the Stay Safe programme.</P>
        <P>An initial one-day in-service training seminar on the Stay Safe programme has been provided for all primary schools. Since the programme was introduced, 99.7% of primary schools have participated in this training.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department does not have an accurate survey of each school in County Sligo which is implementing the Stay Safe programme specifically. It should be noted, however, that while the Stay Safe programme is not mandatory, the teaching of a personal safety programme to ensure child protection is now an integral element of the curricular subject of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and is mandatory in all primary schools. This ensures that child protec<Col N="837"/>tion issues remain central to teaching and learning in our schools.</P>
        <P>However, in order to ensure that the most accurate up-to-date information about the implementation of the Stay Safe programme in all primary schools in the State, I have instructed officials in my Department to liaise with the relevant personnel charged with the delivery of the Stay Safe programme to examine whether an up-to-date survey of schools is required.</P>
        <P>The introduction of SPHE as subject on the revised primary school curriculum combined with the implementation of the national child protection guidelines, Children First, gave an additional impetus to the Stay Safe programme.</P>
        <P>It is a priority of my Department to ensure that a high level of awareness and necessary skills to address child protection issues, which includes the implementation of the Stay Safe programme, is maintained in all schools. For this reason, my Department will continue to support the promotion of child protection within the context of the social, personal and health education curriculum.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the lowest tender available for construction of the additional classroom approved for a school (details supplied) in County Wexford is &euro;150,000; if her attention has further been drawn to the fact that the grant of &euro;100,000 from her Department for the purpose of providing this accommodation is therefore inadequate; if the community will raise the balance of funding required to advance this project; if her Department will therefore increase the grant in order that the full cost of the new classroom will be met; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of the expansion of the devolved scheme 2005 for primary school building works a grant of &euro;100,000 was sanctioned to <Col N="838"/>enable the management authorities of the school in question to provide one additional permanent classroom.</P>
        <P>The initiative allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives boards of management control of the building project.</P>
        <P>My Department does not intend increasing the amount of the grant offered to the school. This is because a central tenet of the devolved scheme is that the school, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs, and ensuring value for money.</P>
        <P>The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects. The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding. The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.</P>

	<P>There are currently two members of staff on leave undertaking full-time study paid for by my Department. The number of staff undertaking part-time or evening study in the 2005-06 academic year that will be refunded by my Department is 72.</P>
        <P>My Department recognises the importance of training and developing its staff and seeks to promote a learning and development culture within the organisation. Continuous learning is central to enhanced performance. Staff are encouraged to avail of self-learning opportunities, including pursuit of third level qualifications in their own time. My Department operates a refund of course and examination fees scheme under Department of Finance guidelines, circular 21/78, and has, to date, been in a position to refund 100% of the costs of course and examination fees for approved courses.</P>
        <P>The subject areas being studied and the qualifications which are expected to be achieved are shown in the attached table. Training and development is seen as a key element of the performance management and development system, PMDS. Staff are supported in acquiring the skills and competencies needed to perform to a high standard and meet their objectives, including career expectations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As well as the refund of fees scheme, my Department has a pilot scheme in place for the advance payment of fees for postgraduate studies undertaken in the officer&rsquo;s own time and of particular relevance to the Department, for example, a master&rsquo;s degree in educational disadvantage, a master of science in educational matters, a doctorate in special education, or a doctorate in educational psychology.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the refund of fees scheme and the pilot scheme for advance payment of fees, staff undertake in writing to refund the payment in the event of leaving the public service before completing one year&rsquo;s service in respect of each academic year or course period for which a payment has been made.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the position regarding recent changes in relation to the teaching of children with mild learning difficulties and the new general allocation system and if she will ensure that all children with disabilities get proper resource teaching hours.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1123/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation system has been introduced under which all mainstream primary schools have been provided with learning support/resource teacher, <Col N="841"/>LS/RT support, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as mild general learning disability and those with learning support needs.</P>
        <P>My Department issued a comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, to all primary schools last year regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low-incidence disabilities, such as moderate general learning disability, for example.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with learning support and high-incidence special education needs that will receive supplementary teaching support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>The school can use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child. There is nothing to stop the school from allocating one-to-one resource teaching support to any pupil if they feel that this is the best type of support to meet their needs.</P>

        <Quest>her views on whether physical education comprises an essential part of the school curriculum; the progress which has been made in the application for the provision of a sports hall for a college (details supplied) in County Clare; when approval for the project will be granted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that a well planned physical education programme has a vitally important role to play in a broad and balanced curriculum for our primary and second level students.</P>
        <P>At primary level, physical education is one of the seven curriculum areas within the primary school curriculum, which was revised in 1999. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils.</P>
        <P>At second level, while physical education is not a mandatory subject, it should form part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department&rsquo;s approved syllabi, and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable. The time recommended for physical education is two hours per week.</P>
        <P>The phasing in of a revised syllabus at junior cycle level for non-examination physical education commenced in September 2003. The syllabi at both primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available in schools vary. Consequently, they offer flexibility regarding the physical activities undertaken so that each individual school can design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to the school.</P>
        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has made an application for capital funding towards the provision of a PE hall. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria. The project is being considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme 2006-2010.</P>

	<P>At junior certificate level, the current syllabi for English at higher, ordinary and foundation levels were introduced in September 1989 and first examined in June 1992. At leaving certificate level, the current syllabi for English at higher and ordinary levels were introduced in September 1999 and first examined in June 2001.</P><Col N="846"/>
        <P>The current syllabi for junior certificate music at higher and ordinary levels were introduced in September 1991 and first examined in June 1994. Regarding leaving certificate music, the current syllabi at higher and ordinary levels in were introduced in September 1997 and first examined in June 1999.</P>
        <P>Full details of the current syllabi are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is reviewing junior certificate syllabi on a phased basis. Work on English and music is well advanced.</P>
        <P>As a next step in advancing senior cycle reform, I have asked the NCCA to prioritise the reconfiguration of subjects generally within the leaving certificate to review content and learning outcomes, embed key skills, and to provide for a second assessment component. English will be in the first phase of subjects to be reviewed in that way.</P>

        <P>The school authorities wrote to my Department in December 2005 requesting amendments to the brief, and that is currently being examined by my officials.

        <P>The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects. The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding. The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of building is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is currently funding 11 autism-specific facilities, which are operating on a pilot basis. Some of those facilities provide an applied behavioural analysis, ABA, model of response, which is one of a range of models of approach to the education of children with autism. Approval has also been given for the establishment of a further three such facilities.</P>
        <P>In addition to the autism specific facilities outlined above, my Department also provides the following dedicated facilities for the education of children with autism. Some 159 special classes for children with autism, attached to special schools and mainstream schools, have been created. Some 15 pre-school classes for children with autism have been established, and five special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome have been created.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, my Department may sanction home tuition grants for children with autism for whom a home-based ABA programme is considered appropriate or in cases where such children are awaiting an appropriate school placement.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for all children, including children with autism, is through the primary and post-primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools. My Department would also support an eclectic approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available, for example, treatment and education of autistic and related communication-handicapped children, TEACH, ABA, and picture exchange communication system, PECS.</P>
        <P>While the preferred approach of my Department is to provide appropriate provision through the recognised primary and post-primary school network, it will continue, in conjunction with the National Council for Special Education, to consider applications that may be received for the establishment of further stand-alone autism facili<Col N="854"/>ties. Those applications will be carefully examined and considered on a case-by-case basis, and account will be taken of several factors, such as the availability of appropriate school-based provision in a particular area, before any decisions are made.</P>
        <P>On a more general point, my Department has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of all school personnel working with children with special educational needs, including children with autism. The increased training provision is specifically designed to address the complex range and variety of training needs in the area of special education needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Specifically, since the strategy was introduced it has produced a major expansion of the range of postgraduate professional training programmes; the introduction of a range of new training programmes to provide a mix of intensive induction training and more advanced training in specific areas; and the establishment of the Special Education Support Service, SESS, in September 2003.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The major increase in postgraduate training places will further increase the number of teachers who have already developed their skills over previous years under the strategy. It is important to note that the new diploma programmes are aimed not only at providing development and support at individual teacher level, but, crucially, at whole-school staff level. That ensures the optimum learning outcomes for Special Education Needs, SEN, students.</P>
        <P>My Department also funds the development of an ABA training programme in Trinity College Dublin, and it supported the participation of 12 teachers on the course in 2003-04. The successful participants are now available as classroom teachers and, more importantly, as a further training resource for other teachers in this area. Short-term induction programmes in SEN are provided annually by several teacher training colleges, usually two or three courses per college, catering for up to 120 teachers.</P>
        <P>The Special Education Support Service, SESS, was established to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs, including autism. Hosted in Cork Education Support Centre, the SESS, which is funded by my Department, has recently undergone a significant expansion in available resources in response to the education and development needs of teachers and other school staff working with students with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>In addition, and as indicated earlier, the National Council for Special Education is now operational. A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is to identify appropriate educational placements for all children <Col N="855"/>with special educational needs, including children with autism.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances I am confident that the steps that I have outlined above, and those in hand, especially the establishment of the NCSE, will ensure that an appropriate educational provision can be put in place for all children with special needs, including children with autism, in a timely manner.</P>

        <Quest>the number of educational assessments of children with special needs that have been carried out in the past 12 months in respect of which the State has paid for the cost; and if that level of service is adequate to ensure that all children with special needs have the nature of their learning difficulty identified at the earliest possible opportunity.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that when the Deputy refers to educational assessments, he is referring to psychological assessments and other professional assessments undertaken by professionals who are not employed directly by schools.</P>
        <P>All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments, either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, full details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>In the school year 2003-04, NEPS psychologists carried out a total of 5,024 assessments &mdash; not all assessments involved full cognitive IQ assessments. In the same school year, a total of 3,611 assessments were completed under the terms of SCPA, administered and paid for by NEPS.</P>
        <P>The figures for 2004-05 are not yet available, but I am arranging for that information to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>
        <P>Assessments by professional services that have a bearing on education provision for children, especially young children with special needs, are often undertaken directly through the Health Service Executive, HSE, or through voluntary agencies funded by HSE. My Department does not have the statistical data in that regard.</P>
        <P>In common with many other psychological services, NEPS operates a staged model of service to schools, whereby an initial referral usually leads to a consultation and provision of advice to teachers and parents on appropriate teaching and management strategies. Progress is kept under review, and only those children who fail to respond to these interventions will need referral for full psychological assessment. That allows the psychologists to offer early appointments to young children in urgent need of support, and early advice to teachers in respect of those chil<Col N="856"/>dren whose needs are perhaps less pressing but who still need additional help in school.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has introduced a general allocation model of additional resources to all primary schools for children in the high incidence category of special educational needs as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular Sp Ed 02/05. That enables an automatic response on the part of schools to any child deemed to be in need of additional teaching resources, including children whose needs may not emerge immediately. The needs of such children are normally kept under review by the school, and it is for the school authorities in conjunction with the various support agencies to make application for psychological and other assessment to determine whether a child falls into the category of low incidence. Subsequently, the school authorities can make application to the NCSE for additional resources in the case of a child diagnosed as being within any of the low-incidence categories of disability.</P>
        <P>In many cases, children with special needs categorised as being within the low incidence category of need have already been assessed and identified prior to enrolment in school. In that event, application can be made immediately to the NCSE for the provision of additional and appropriate support for those children in school.</P>
        <P>The system of assessment and provision is kept under constant review by my Department, and I am satisfied that in general the current arrangements in that regard for children with special needs are adequate.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year that is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher, and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Officials of my Department are drawing up the revised staffing schedule necessary to achieve that. Schools will be asked to use the extra class teachers provided <Col N="857"/>as a result of the revised schedule to provide for smaller classes in the junior grades.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a principal and nine mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 243 pupils at 30 September 2004. The school also has one permanent learning support or resource post, one permanent special class post, and the services of a shared permanent learning support or resource post, a shared temporary resource post and a shared temporary language support post, all based in the school.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 248 pupils. The staffing for the 2006-07 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the revised staffing schedule.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005-06 school year is a principal and 21 mainstream class teaching posts. That is based on an enrolment of 588 pupils at 30 September 2004. The school also has three learning support or resource teaching posts, two special class posts, and two temporary language support posts.</P>
        <P>It is open to the board of management of a primary school to submit an appeal, under certain criteria, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. The board adjudicates on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools and operates independently of the Minister and my Department. The board&rsquo;s decisions are final.</P>
        <P>Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years, with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. That represents the largest increase in teacher <Col N="860"/>numbers since the expansion of free education. Currently there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under the action plan for tackling disadvantage published earlier this year, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place this term, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>
        <P>There is more to be done to reduce class sizes further. Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed himself to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next two years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into our schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.</P>
        <P>The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year, that is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher, and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Officials of my Department are currently drawing up the revised staffing schedule necessary to achieve that. Schools will be asked to use the extra class teachers provided as a result of the revised schedule to provide for smaller classes in the junior grades.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority will be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done that. Now, in line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.</P>

        <P>The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Officials in my Department are currently drawing up the revised staffing schedule necessary to achieve this. Schools will be asked to use the extra class teachers provided as a result of the revised schedule to provide for smaller classes in the junior grades.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school at 30 September 2004 was 148 pupils which warranted a staffing of principal and five mainstream class teaching posts for the 2005-06 school year. However, the school was granted two extra mainstream class teachers for the 2005-06 school year under developing school criteria due to a projected increased enrolment of 187 pupils on 30 September 2005. In addition, the school also has one learning support-resource post and one temporary resource post.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department Primary Circular 19/02, which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today, there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant improvements have also been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at post-primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.4:1 in the 2004-05 school year.</P>
        <P>Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under the action plan for tackling disadvantage published earlier this year, there will be a reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place this term, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>
        <P>There is more to be done to reduce class sizes further. Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following <Col N="867"/>year. Accordingly, over the next two years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage. This will be done by changing the staffing schedule. As the Deputy will be aware, the mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, which is issued annually to all primary schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Officials of my Department are drawing up the revised staffing schedule necessary to achieve this. Schools will be asked to use the extra class teachers provided as a result of the revised schedule to provide for smaller classes in the junior grades.</P>
        <P>In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done this and now, in line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1326 and 1337 together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with <Col N="868"/>special educational needs, SEN, into ordinary mainstream schools. Where mainstream provision is not appropriate children can be catered for in special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are 107 special schools in the country at present. These schools cater for children from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil teacher ratio and other staffing supports. Additional special needs assistant, SNA, support is provided if deemed necessary. Special schools also receive increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
        <P>Children with SEN can also attend special classes attached to ordinary mainstream schools. All special classes enjoy the same increased levels of staffing and funding as are made available to the special schools. Children with SEN attending special classes attached to ordinary schools may also, where appropriate, be integrated into ordinary classes for periods of the school day.</P>
        <P>A general allocation scheme has been introduced under which mainstream primary schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence SEN such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. All schools were notified of their general allocation for the 2005-06 school year last May.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, is responsible for processing applications from schools for special needs supports such as resource teaching hours and SNA support for children with low-incidence SEN, on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. Once a school has been advised of its general allocation and the SENO has allocated hours and SNA support if appropriate in respect of pupils with low-incidence SEN, it is a matter for the school authority to recruit the relevant staff.</P>
        <P>There has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with SEN. At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At second level approximately 1,637 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole-time equivalent learning support teachers in our second level schools.</P>
        <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs <Col N="869"/>of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or SNA support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P>Enormous progress has also been made in relation to increasing the number of SNAs in our schools who specifically cater for the care needs of children with special educational needs. There are over 7,200 whole time equivalent SNAs in primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs.</P>
        <P>With regard to accommodation requirements in the areas referred to by the Deputy, I am aware that the areas, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in the areas in question. While the information sought is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy, the following is an outline of the measures undertaken by my Department to ensure that there are adequate places available in these areas to meet demand.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, following widespread local consultation, my Department recently published an area development plan for the N4-M4 corridor. This plan outlines my Department&rsquo;s long-term educational strategy at both primary and post-primary level for this area which includes Leixlip, Kilcock, Celbridge, Maynooth and Clane. Implementation of the recommendations in the plan is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2006 onwards subject to the prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.</P>
        <P>All of these initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned. The school planning section of my Department will keep the position under review going forward to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P><Col N="870"/>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that responsibility for the provision of therapy services rests with the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>This Government has invested in the largest school building programme in the history of the State. Between 1998 and the end of 2004, almost &euro;2 billion was invested in school buildings and in the region of 7,500 large and small projects were completed in schools, including 130 brand new schools and 510 large scale refurbishments-extensions. Indeed, funding for school building and renovation projects has increased five-fold since 1997. In 2006, &euro;491 million will be spent on school building projects, compared to just &euro;92 million in 1997. This, in its own right, is an increase of over 9% in real terms on the 2005 allocation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, at the end of last year I outlined my spending plans for plans for primary and post-primary schools for 2006. With &euro;491 million to be spent on school buildings, there will be over 1,300 projects active in schools all over the country. This significant investment will allow me to continue to progress our major programme of school building and modernisation which includes improving equipment needed for new technologies and ICT. I have already started to outline individual schools around the country that will benefit under the various parts of the programme throughout the year with the announcement of 62 schools that have been given the go ahead to start architectural planning. I will be announcing details of the other aspects of the programme as we move through the year.</P>
        <P>Principal features of the 2006 building and modernisation programme include &euro;277 million targeted at primary schools and &euro;204 million in the post-primary sector; almost 200 major school building projects at construction during 2006; 105 primary school projects and 62 post-primary projects advancing in architectural design; and further use of fast-track design solutions for primary schools. It is expected that up to 12 primary schools will be built using a standardised design model or a design and build process. The first school built under this model opened in Balgaddy, Lucan in September 2005, having taken just ten months to build and up to 200 primary schools will receive approval for devolved funding under the small school and permanent accommodation initiatives during the coming year. This is in addition to the 153 schools that will have projects at construction during 2006 under these initiatives.</P>
        <P>Small school and permanent accommodation initiatives, which were piloted over the last two years, will become a permanent feature of the building programme. This will enable schools to get works done faster by allowing them to run the projects themselves; and announcement of the successful applicants under the summer works scheme, which allows schools undertake projects <Col N="873"/>such as roof repairs, window replacement, electrical and mechanical upgrades during the summer months.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Bus &Eacute;ireann, which administers the school transport scheme locally on behalf of my Department, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of school bus services. Routes are determined on the basis of numbers of eligible pupils in particular areas, road networks, distance guidelines and other operational factors.</P>
        <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 2.4 km to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme.</P>
        <P>The families residing in the area referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied are being accommodated within guidelines. My Department is not prepared to approve an extension of a service where it is satisfied that children have a level of service within the school transport guidelines. However, parents of eligible children may, where feasible and subject to certain conditions, pay for an extension to an existing transport route. Accordingly, the parents in this case, should they so wish, may consult with the local Bus &Eacute;ireann office regarding arrangements for a payable extension. I should point out that my Department referred back to Bus &Eacute;ireann for some additional information with regard to its initial report.

        <P Just="Left">The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area &mdash; otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus <Col N="876"/>after all other eligible children travelling to their &ldquo;own&rdquo; post-primary centre have been catered for.

	<P>My attention has not been drawn to <Col N="877"/>concerns regarding the functionality of the management information system, MIS, installed in all institutes of technology with regard to student services and specifically with regard to examination results.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The MIS system comprises four integrated elements: student registration; financial; payroll-human resource and library. The system tracks all student records, including registration, courses, link modules and examination performance. The financial system provides for individual budget responsibility within the institutes and it produces annual accounts. The payroll-human resource system links with the student system to facilitate timetabling. The library system tracks all movements of materials and also facilitates on-line access to journals and articles by students and staff.</P>
        <P>The project involved some 59 installations of hardware and software across the institutions and all installations have been completed. Given that there was a phased implementation of the system, some institutes are more advanced than others in the operation of its constituent elements. Where individual institutes have queries about any aspects of the operation of the system, a helpdesk facility is available. I understand also that institutes share operational information to maximise the benefits from the system.</P>
        <P>The institutes have informed my Department that the MIS has proved to be a critical and decisive element in the modernisation and transformation of the management and operation of the institutes of technology and that it has already produced major benefits for students and colleges.</P>

These projects will be considered for further progression under the 2006 capital programme in the context of the prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. In addition, an in-depth examination of primary and post-primary infrastructural provision in Mullingar is being carried out in the school planning section of my Department.

	<P Just="Left">My Department is committed under its human resources strategy to ensuring a positive working environment for all staff and to enable each person to work with dignity and respect, free from bullying, harassment or sexual harassment. Such complaints are dealt with in accordance with the procedures agreed with staff representative bodies, outlined in a Positive Working Environment &mdash; an Anti-Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying Policy for the Civil Service. Since 2000, the above procedures have been invoked in respect of some five complaints from staff in my Department.</P>
        <P>This aforementioned document was recently revised to take account of legislative developments and experience gained in the operation of the policy since its original introduction in 2000. Staff in my Department were notified of the introduction of a revised policy with effect from 1 September 2005 and provided with an electronic copy. Staff upon appointment to my Department are also provided with a copy. The document may also be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s intranet. The introduction of legislation to deal with bullying is not a matter for my Department.</P>

	<P>My Department operates two bonus or merit schemes for all staff &mdash; a performance-related awards scheme for posts at the level of assistant secretaries general and an employee recognition awards scheme, Aitheantas, that <Col N="885"/>recognises exceptional performance for all other grades up to and including principal officer and equivalent in the Department.</P>
        <P>Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary are covered by a scheme of performance-related awards, which was introduced in 2002. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, which are available on the website <i>www.finance.gov.ie.</i> The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information. Prior to the introduction of the current scheme, there was a scheme of awards for assistant secretaries general, which was based on 4% of the pay bill for assistant secretaries general. Payments under the Department&rsquo;s Aitheantas scheme for staff up to and including principal officer and equivalent grades are made annually. Individual awards &mdash;&euro;1,000 in 2005 &mdash; for all grades and group awards &mdash;&euro;250 per group member in 2005 &mdash; are made.</P>
        <P>Criteria for receipt of an award under the Aitheantas scheme include consistently high performance, creative application of skills and initiative to the resolution of difficult issues, development of new procedures and processes which increase the effectiveness and-or quality of a service, exceptional commitment shown in the implementation of specific measures, establishment and maintenance of high standards of quality in the delivery of a particular service or services, highly effective co-ordination of activities which results in meeting targets ahead of schedule, assuming effective control in areas when urgent action is required to maintain quality or credibility of an educational service and-or providing leadership of a project team resulting in improved performance. A breakdown, by grade, of the number of awards in 2005 grade is as follows.</P>

	<P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992. Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including <Col N="887"/>those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment. The process of assessing eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or vocational educational committee.</P>
        <P>Officials of my Department contacted the higher education grants section of Cork County Council concerning the candidate referred to by the Deputy. It is understood that following an assessment of the documentation received in support of the application concerned, it was established that the grant application was not proper to that body. The application was recently forwarded to the higher education grants section of Dublin City Council which is the appropriate assessment body in this case. Officials in my Department have established that Dublin City Council is currently assessing the candidate&rsquo;s application.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the school to which he refers has agreed to amalgamate with another school in the area. In common with all amalgamation situations, a technical inspection was carried out on the existing buildings to ascertain, which if either, would be suitable to act as a host for the new school. The technical report has been received and examined in the school planning section and it will be informing the school authority of the outcome shortly.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the proposed project has been assessed in accordance with the prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. Progress on the project will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2006 onwards.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland are jointly engaged in the development of the Middletown Centre for Autism in County Armagh. Both Departments <Col N="888"/>have jointly funded the purchase of the former St. Joseph&rsquo;s Adolescent Centre, Middletown, and plan to refurbish the property with a view to developing a centre of excellence for children and young people with autism throughout the island of Ireland. The centre will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders. Four key services will be provided by the centre: a learning support service, on a residential basis; an educational assessment service; a training and advisory service and an autism research and information service. Officials from both Departments are working closely on this project and this interaction between the two Departments will continue over the coming months with a view to ensuring that the centre becomes operational as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Our schools promote, support and encourage healthy eating and physical exercise in a range of ways. With regard to educating students about making good food choices, a curriculum in social, personal and health education, SPHE, is mandatory for all primary students and its implementation is also being assisted by a full-time support service. Health and well-being along with food and nutrition are two areas dealt with under the &ldquo;taking care of my body&rdquo; unit of that curriculum. The objective is that by fifth and sixth class, pupils should be enabled to realise that they, as individuals, have some responsibility for adopting a healthy balanced diet and for taking regular and appropriate exercise.</P>
        <P>All second level schools have been required to provide SPHE as part of the junior cycle curriculum since September 2003. The aims of this programme include preparing students for responsible decision making and promoting their physical, mental and emotional health and well-being. Physical education is also part of the curriculum at primary and at post-primary level and plays a key role not just in giving students an opportunity to exercise during the school day but also in encouraging a positive attitude towards physical activity which students will hopefully carry with them into adult life.</P>
        <P>Quite apart from curricular provision, schools can implement measures to encourage physical activity during school breaks and schools already play a major role in promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland and the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>Together these initiatives ensure that children not only get opportunities to exercise at school but also learn about balanced nutrition and making good food choices. I believe that schools are playing their part in terms of promoting a healthy <Col N="892"/>diet and adequate physical exercise for children. However, it is important to remember that children spend just 20% of their waking hours at school so schools can only do so much with regard to promoting exercise and healthy eating and the main role must rest with parents.</P>

	<P>The teacher supply and demand issue at second level is very complex. Analyses undertaken by my Department in the past indicated that there are regional and subject variations. A further complicating factor is that vacancies in second level schools usually require specific subject combinations.</P>
        <P>By way of background I should point out that the teacher education section of my Department is responsible for teacher education and development, with particular regard to initial teacher education covering the colleges of education and the education departments in the universities and colleges. In the case of undergraduate courses for woodwork teachers, such as the degree in construction studies in the University of Limerick, the position is that my Department has a role in the provision of funding for these institutions on an individual basis through the Higher Education Authority, HEA. However, it is a matter for the individual institutions to decide on the number of places available on such courses in a manner similar to decisions taken on the annual intake for any particular course of study. My Department does not and cannot have a direct role in the regulation of the overall number of people who opt to pursue a particular qualification in these institutions.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HEA will continue to review the supply and demand of second-level teachers on an ongoing basis. Arising from recommendations from the OECD report entitled Teachers Matter and other significant recent developments in relation to teacher education my Department will shortly commence an extensive consultative process with the education departments of universities and colleges with a view to enhancing the system-wide response to emerging concerns such as an under or over supply of teachers. Initial contacts with the colleges and education departments of universities have been positive.</P>

	<P>In May 2004, the school to which the Deputy refers refused a devolved grant of &euro;70,000 to provide extra permanent accommodation. Subsequently, it sought approval for four extra classrooms to accommodate a mainstream classroom teacher and three special education teachers, SET. This was approved by way of rental of two full sized classrooms, 76 m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>, one of which was to be sub-divided into three smaller rooms to accommodate the SETs which require 16 m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> each. It subsequently transpired that the school proceeded, without sanction, to rent three classrooms. Retrospective approval was sought for the third classroom which was refused by my Department on the grounds that its accommodation requirements were adequately addressed with the original sanction. The school authority has appealed this decision and the matter is currently being re-examined in the school planning section.</P>
        <P>The school authority has made an application under the additional accommodation scheme 2006 and the summer works scheme 2006.

With regard to the school&rsquo;s application for large scale capital funding, this application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and progress on the project is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2006 onwards.</P>

	<P>The Youth Work Act 2001 provides a legal framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services to be organised by the Minister for Education and Science, the vocational education committees and national and major regional youth work organisations. Section 1 of the Act provides for sections to be commenced at different stages. Sections 2 to 7, 17, 18 and 24 have been commenced to date.</P>
        <P>My Department, together with youth work interests, both voluntary and statutory, have been developing the groundwork, including detailed guidelines and procedures, which are essential to the further roll-out of the Act in a planned and structured manner. As a priority for 2005, I identified the capacity development of youth work <Col N="895"/>organisations to assist them in preparing themselves organisationally for the implementation of the Act. To this end I established a development fund of &euro;300,000 for youth work organisations specifically for 2005 to help them achieve the new standards for approval and engage effectively with the new structures arising from the Youth Work Act 2001.</P>
        <P>Another area to which I attach importance is the capacity development of vocational education committees, VECs, to carry out the responsibilities set out for them in the Act. Discussions which have been ongoing in this regard are at an advanced stage and nearing completion. In addition, significant progress has been made with regard to the appointment of an assessor of youth work with the post advertised in December 2005 and interviews due to commence soon with a view to an early appointment. This post is viewed by all involved in youth work, both in the statutory and voluntary sectors, as an essential step forward.</P>
        <P>Another key component for the progression of youth work in Ireland is the national youth work development plan. This plan identifies four main goals and proposes some 50 action points to achieve these goals over a five year period. To date, a number of priority action areas have been addressed. In 2003, &euro;80,000 was spent on the implementation of a child protection training programme for the sector. In 2004 &euro;500,000 was made available for the roll-out of the plan and was spent on further support for the child protection training programme, development of projects funded under the special projects for youth scheme and increased support to youth information centres and the youth information support partnership.</P>
        <P>Building on these initiatives, further progress also continues to be made in: the establishment of ten new special projects for disadvantaged youth in 2005; the upgrade of 20 single worker special projects to two worker projects in 2005; review of youth work funding, nearing completion; review of youth information provision, nearing completion; continued support of the child protection training programme; continued support of the development fund for youth work organisations; the successful launch of the joint North-South education and training standards committee in Armagh by the Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, Deputy de Valera, and Minister Angela Smith, Department of Education, Northern Ireland; and continued groundwork on the establishment of national youth work development unit in NUI, Maynooth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is intended that further sections of the Act will be implemented on a progressive and phased basis as resources, both human and financial, permit. I am confident that the progressive roll-out of the Youth Work Act 2001 will serve to enhance programmes and services for young <Col N="896"/>people at local, regional and national level. Further action areas for development in 2006 and 2007 are being determined by my Department with the advice of the national youth work advisory committee.</P>

Also in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for reasonable accommodations in certificate examinations and responds to queries and requests for assessments in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.</P><Col N="897"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>In common with many other psychological services, NEPS operates a staged model of service to schools, whereby an initial referral usually leads to a consultation and provision of advice to teachers and parents on appropriate teaching and management strategies. Progress is kept under review and only those children who fail to respond to these interventions will need to see a psychologist. This allows the psychologists to offer early appointments to children who are in urgent need of support and early advice to teachers in respect to those children whose needs are perhaps less pressing but who still need additional help in school.</P>
        <P>At present, approximately 53% of schools in County Kildare &mdash; 68 schools out of a total number of 129 &mdash; have access to a dedicated service from NEPS and this represents more than 65% of the student population. Information regarding numbers of NEPS psychologists working in County Kildare in previous years is not always meaningful in terms of comparisons as psychologists were assigned at that time to a number of areas. For example, in 2002-2003 eight psychologists were assigned to a number of schools in County Kildare but they also worked in other schools within the eastern region, south-west area, which encompasses west Dublin as well as Kildare. From 2003-2004, however, allocation of psychologists in this region was more focused geographically.</P>
        <P>The information in respect of the other years in question is as follows: 2003-2004 five psychologists; 2004-2005 five psychologists; and 2005-2006 five psychologists.</P>
        <P>Schools not served directly by NEPS continue to have access to SCPA. The number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 on establishment to 121 at present. The Public Appointments Service has recently established new recruitment panels for NEPS. Regional panels are now in place and my Department is currently in the process of appointing psychologists. Geographical areas of greatest need are receiving priority in the appointment of psychologists. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

The school in question was listed in my announcement of April 2005 as a project to progress through architectural planning up to pre-tender stage, namely, up to and including advanced architectural planning.</P>
        <P>In order to bring this project to the required stage, my Department&rsquo;s officials have requested and received various amendments to the stage three submission which comprises detailed plans and costs, during 2005. Most recently my Department&rsquo;s officials wrote to the school authorities on 21 September 2005 with some further queries and a response has been received. This will be examined as soon as possible and my officials will then be in further contact with the school authorities with regard to the next steps involved in progressing this project. Progression of projects to construction will be considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme 2005-2009.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 491 on 6 December 2005, red safety areas were first adopted at Casement Aerodrome following a review in 1992 by Aer Rianta, on behalf of the Department of Defence, of policy in relation to safety zones at the aerodrome and were introduced to ensure the safe and unobstructed operation of air traffic to and from Casement Aerodrome. International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and recommendations in relation to obstacle limitation surfaces for airports, designed to protect the safety of aircraft as they land and take off by ensuring that there are no obstacles in the way, as well as considerations in regard to public safety in the vicinity of the aerodrome were taken into account in determining the size and shape of the red safety areas at Casement Aerodrome. The red safety areas were not determined solely by reference to the risk considerations to third parties on the ground. The Snow report prepared in 1999 recommended in the case of Casement Aerodrome that the approach areas be retained for security and safety reasons because of the large proportion of training, including single engine-solo flights by inexperienced pilots, carried out at the aerodrome. The matter will, however, be kept under review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Defence Forces regulation R5, paragraph 6(g), prescribes that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall be ineligible for enlistment in the Reserve Defence Force. This would also apply to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wishing to apply for appointment as officers of the Defence Forces Reserve. Conversely an enlisted member of the Defence Forces Reserve who wishes to join the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be discharged from the Defence Forces Reserve before joining the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. an officer of the Defence Forces Reserve would have to relinquish his or her commission in order to join the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having particular regard to section 86 of the Defence Acts 1954 to 1998, where an officer shall be liable to be called out, as may be directed by the Minister, on permanent service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The rationale behind the policy of precluding dual membership of the Defence Forces Reserve and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that membership of the Defence Forces Reserve renders an individual potentially liable to be called up for permanent service at any time. This condition of membership of the Defence Forces Reserve would conflict with similar requirements attaching to membership of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of which are also liable for duty at all times.</P>

	<P>Service medals and bars are issued to members of the Defence Forces as prescribed in Defence Forces regulation A9, new series, and administration instruction Part 19. The military authorities advise that members of the Army reserve, formerly an F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, and the Naval Service reserve, formerly an Slua Muir&iacute;, are awarded an Bonn Seirbh&iacute;se, the Service Medal, on completing seven years satisfactory service in recognition of their service and contribution to the Defence Forces and to the State. A bar is added to the medal on completing 12 years satisfactory service and a second bar on completing 21 years satisfactory service.</P>
        <P>The military authorities indicate that in their view the existing provisions regarding the award of such medals and bars is sufficient. There are currently no plans to change the relevant regulations to provide for additional medals and-or bars. I believe that the current provisions for the award of medals to such personnel give due recognition to the valuable and valued service of such members.</P>

        <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork is not being paid while they are out of work; and if a sick leave payment will be granted.</Quest>

	<P>I should explain that the sick pay arrangements for civilian employees of my Department apply to the person concerned. In general, civilian employees may be granted up to six months sick leave at full pay in any period of 12 months and half pay thereafter subject to a maximum of 12 months sick leave of any kind &mdash; full pay, half pay or without pay &mdash; in any period of four years or less. Civilian employees are also eligible for social welfare disability benefit while absent due to sickness.</P>
        <P>In this particular case, the person concerned has exhausted his entitlement to sick pay under the terms of the departmental sick leave scheme as he has availed of over 365 days sick leave in the past four years. The Deputy will appreciate that the terms of the departmental sick leave scheme are of general application and that the terms of the scheme cannot be altered to suit individual circumstances. Accordingly, I regret to say that it will not be possible to authorise payment of sick pay to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The person referred to is in receipt of both a service pension under the Defence Forces pension schemes and a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts from my Department. The schemes provide that, where a person in receipt of a service pension is granted a disability pension, the service pension must be reduced or abated, usually by an amount equal to one half of the disability pension. The reduction is applied to the service pension and not to the disability pension. There may be an advantage to the pensioner in this arrangement because disability pensions are exempt from income tax whereas service pensions are liable to tax. The service pension of the person in question is the subject of reduction in accordance with the provisions mentioned.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1415 and 1416 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>Both the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces perform complementary roles in the protection of the security of the State. There is ongoing and close liaison between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding internal security matters including in the intelligence field. Both agencies gather and share information and assessments on perceived or emerging security threats. In addition, mutual assistance and co-operation is maintained between the Irish security services and those of other like-minded countries to ensure effective flow of relevant intelligence. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. In the intelligence field, the Defence Forces act in a complementary role, primarily in the gathering and analysis of intelligence on paramilitary activities, while also providing intelligence on external threats, in particular, threat assessments in respect of locations where the Defence Forces are deployed on overseas peace support missions. Military intelligence is also responsible for ensuring the security of the Defence Forces against internal threats.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P>I am advised that military intelligence does not maintain files on politicians or political activists <i>per se</i>. It would only be in cases where a person, or a group to which he or she belonged, was considered to pose a potential threat to the security interests of the State that it might be considered appropriate to monitor such activities. The director of intelligence provides briefings to me, to the Chief of Staff and to the deputy chief of staff for operations on such threats. In addition, the Chief of Staff, who is a member of the national security committee, apprises that committee on the nature of such threats. Due to their nature, the content of those briefings must be kept confidential. As such, I am not at liberty, nor would it be appropriate for me to indicate the nature and extent of any activities which the Defence Forces may undertake in this regard or to disclose information received by me on such issues.</P>

	<P>Following a number of questions in the D&aacute;il on this matter I undertook to have the military archive examined on the Niemba ambush and to revert with the findings. The question arising was whether Trooper Browne was killed at the Niemba ambush or whether he survived for a few days and was killed near a village where he was foraging for food. A recently published book, <i>The Irish Army in the Congo 1960-64</i> outlines the second version and draws on material from the unit history for this account. This differs from the long held understanding that nine members of the Defence Forces died at Niemba. Accordingly, I requested the military authorities to examine the relevant files and they have reverted with the following information. The unit history that has been referred to holds many differing accounts of how Trooper Browne met his untimely death. The unit history, written six years after the event, does not attempt to reconcile the differing accounts of Trooper Browne&rsquo;s death.</P>
        <P>The unit history does include an account that Trooper Browne survived the initial action for two days and was killed approximately three miles from the site of the action. However, this information was not included in the D&aacute;il replies because it is not supported by any independent sources. In November 1961, the <i>Tribunal de Premiere Instance d&rsquo;Elizabethville</i>, convicted five Baluba tribesmen of killing Trooper Browne and eight others on the 8 November 1960. Information from Baluba survivors in Manona hospital in 1960 led investigators to believe that Trooper Browne was killed at Niemba and that his body had been removed from the scene by the ambushers. It was a Baluba custom that they bore off from the field of battle their most courageous victim. Accordingly, it was decided that, on the balance of probability, Trooper Browne died on the battlefield in an attempt to save his comrades life. What remains incontrovertible is that Trooper Browne died, directly or indirectly, as a result of the Niemba engagement.</P>

	<P>&ldquo;A Positive Working Environment: an Anti Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying Policy for the Civil Service&rdquo; is the Civil Service policy for dealing with harassment, sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace. The original policy, introduced in July 2000, has been recently revised to reflect developments at national and EU level since the publication of the original policy, as well as taking on board the experience gained in the Civil Service in the operation of the policy. The revised <Col N="915"/>policy has been circulated to all staff and will be formally launched by the Secretary General of my Department this week. The revised policy came into operation on 1 September 2005. The human resources branch of my Department monitors the issue of bullying and deals with any instances in line with the Civil Service policy. A complaint has been made to the equality tribunal by one civil servant in my Department. There have been no legal cases involving civil servants since 1 January 2000.</P>
        <P>In regard to the State industrial employees, or civilian employees, of this Department, the policy to deal with bullying is also covered by &ldquo;A Positive Working Environment&rdquo;. Information regarding this policy was included in an employee handbook recently issued to all employees and copies of the policy document are available to civilian employees on request from the human resources branch of my Department. The extension of the revised policy to State industrial employees is currently under consideration by the Department of Finance and the various Departments that employ State industrial employees. My Department is currently dealing with two on-going legal cases concerning bullying involving civilian employees. No other such cases have been dealt with or settled since 2000.</P>
        <P>I do not have any plans to introduce legislation in this matter for the Defence Forces as there are in place existing military administrative instructions to address this issue where it arises. These administrative instructions are made pursuant to the Defence Act 1954 and Defence Forces regulations. Defence Forces administrative instruction part 7 codifies the policy and procedures in the conduct of interpersonal relationships and procedures available to personnel concerning the reporting and investigation of allegations of bullying in the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces have had such formal policies and procedures on bullying and sexual harassment in place since February 1996. The report of the Government task force on the prevention of workplace bullying in March 2001 required all public and private organisations to reassess their policies in this area. In 2001, the Defence Forces commenced a re-examination of procedures to bring them into line with the best practice in both the wider public service and in the private sector. Administrative instruction part 7, which deals with the procedures concerning allegations of bullying, was revised to reflect developments in best practice. The instruction in its updated current format was introduced in March 2003. The updated instruction and a user&rsquo;s guide were distributed to every member of the Permanent Defence Force. The Defence Forces and the Department have taken a wide variety of initiatives in relation to the Defence Forces since Dr. Eileen Doyle and the external advisory committee, tasked with examining this issue in the <Col N="916"/>Defence Forces, presented their original report, &ldquo;The Challenge of a Workplace&rdquo; in March 2002. This independent report addressed the range of interpersonal issues within the Defence Forces. Its contents and recommendations were accepted in full.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Implementation of the recommendations of the Doyle report has been one of the highest priorities for the Defence Forces and the Department since its publication. An independent monitoring group established in May 2002 to oversee the implementation of these recommendations reported to my predecessor on 24 September 2004. The independent monitoring group&rsquo;s progress report, &ldquo;Response to the Challenge of a Workplace&rdquo;, is available on the Defence Forces website and describes in detail the very significant progress achieved since the publication of the original Doyle report in 2002.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Arising from the Doyle report, the following steps have been taken with regard to the Defence Forces. Firm guiding principles have been set out in the Defence Forces dignity in the workplace charter. A major educational awareness programme is ongoing throughout the Defence Forces. A new administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships was introduced in March 2003. The instruction and a user&rsquo;s guide were distributed to every member of the Permanent Defence Force. Some 188 of a planned 200 designated contact persons, or DCPs, have been fully trained and are deployed throughout all Defence Forces posts and barracks, both countrywide and overseas. The DCPs will facilitate the operation of the formal and informal procedures that may be used by any party wishing to institute a complaint. An independent external confidential free phone helpline and counselling service was set up for members of the Permanent Defence Force in March 2003. An independent pilot project of exit interviews seeking the experiences and views of outgoing members of the Permanent Defence Force was conducted. Leadership training has been given by external experts and has been the subject of NCO focus groups with an emphasis on training the trainers. Changes in cadet school instruction have been initiated and issues concerning the ranking, selection and training for cadet school instructors are being addressed. Defence Forces regulations, administrative instructions, policies and procedures have been reviewed by an equality steering group under a Labour Court chairperson. The Defence Forces Ombudsman has now been appointed and the practical arrangements for the operational aspects of her office are in progress. An officer within the Defence Forces human resources management section has been assigned responsibility for Equality matters. A training circular entitled &ldquo;Military Code of Conduct for Students and Instructors in all Training Environments&rdquo; was issued in 2004 and was followed by an extensive <Col N="917"/>series of associated workshops for all relevant personnel.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Chief of Staff has repeatedly emphasised that he has recognised the necessity to tackle this matter in a fundamental way at all levels of the Defence Forces and has demonstrated a very active and genuine commitment in the area. He has emphasised that it is incumbent on all commanders to ensure that best practice in the management of personnel is fostered at all levels in order to eliminate the problems identified in the Doyle report. Policies on equality, dignity and bullying are being constantly communicated to all ranks within the Defence Forces. I am satisfied that the military authorities are alert and vigilant <Col N="918"/>to this issue and are committed to addressing the matter in a continuing and proactive manner through educational modules on interpersonal relationships which are now embedded in career courses for all ranks. The matter continues to receive the highest priority in the Defence Forces in terms of incorporating the correct ethos in training at all levels and in terms of maintaining the resources necessary to assist personnel in tackling difficulties where they may arise. With regard to legal cases, my Department has received a number of personal injury claims alleging bullying or sexual harassment. The number of cases disposed of after 1 January 2000 are shown below, along with the number of cases currently outstanding.</P><Col N="917"/>

	<P>Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding of awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals. Prior to the introduction of the revised scheme in 2002, the previous scheme for assistant secretaries was based on 4% of the payroll for the posts of assistant secretaries. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee which are available on the Department of Finance website. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information. The matter of the amounts to be awarded to assistant secretaries in my Department in respect of 2005 is currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>Performance awards for other grades are made to individual staff members and to groups of staff <Col N="918"/>by way of recognition for exceptional performance of duty. In assessing eligibility for awards, regard is given to the nature and quality of the activities involved and to the circumstances under which they were carried out. Attention is also paid to the grade level of the staff members concerned and to what would be regarded as high quality performance from staff in such grades. No such awards were made to staff in my Department in 2005.</P>

The medals indicated in the first table are issued for service spanning the period 1916 to 31 July 1924, the date on which the present day Defence Forces were legally established. The medals in the second table are those which are issued for service with the present day Defence Forces since their establishment in 1924. No medals have ever been struck for personnel who had military service in the period 1921 to 1939, a period that includes service with the then National Army of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann during the civil war period of 1922-1924. Given the unreliability of the records for that period, assessing <Col N="919"/>individual eligibility would now be very problematical.</P>

	<P>The framework for the production of annual corporate procurement plans was developed by the national public procurement policy unit in the Department of Finance during 2005. This is to apply to major infrastructural and network projects valued at &euro;30 million or over. The White Paper on Defence which was published in 2000 set out the policy on defence for this decade with a view to ensuring an appropriate level of defence capability having regard to the changing defence and security environment both at home and abroad. The modernisation of the Defence Forces is an integral part of this policy. This has involved a <Col N="920"/>multi-annual programme for the purchase of new equipment and the provision of improved accommodation and facilities for the Defence Forces. This has been implemented on the basis of procurement plans drawn up each year based on budget allocations.</P>

It is not the practice for the Army Pensions Board to provide me with an annual report. Coiste an Asgard provided an annual report for 2004 and the report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Civil Defence Board is a new State authority established in May 2003 by an order made under the Civil Defence Act 2002. The board initially concentrated its energies in preparing the first ever strategic plan for civil defence, copies of which I arranged to have laid before the Houses in 2005. The board is now finalising its annual report for 2004 for presentation to me and I will arrange to have copies of that report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas at an early date.</P>

        <P FLI="0">An annual contribution of &euro;2.86 million has been paid by the banks to my Department in respect of the provision of cash escorts. This figure was set by the Department of Finance in the 1995 budget and had not been altered since. The contribution from the banks was designed to part-cover the total costs to the State of providing cash <Col N="920"/>escorts. At that time, the contribution covered approximately 72% of the total cost arising to the Defence Forces. Based on annual costings by the Department, the relative level of the contribution had fallen in real terms over the years to the situation where it was only covering 43% of the total costs.</P><Col N="921"/>
        <P>I had a number of discussions with the Irish Bankers Federation on this matter last year, with a view to increasing the level of contribution by the banks in respect of the costs incurred by the Department in the provision of cash escorts. Following detailed and intensive discussions between officials of the IBF, the member banks and the Department, a detailed formal agreement was signed on 11 May 2005.</P>
        <P>This agreement, which is for a five year period, provides that the banks will pay the total actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts. Costs in respect of each 12-month period to end-December, will be paid the following year on or before 1 June. This is to allow for the compilation of returns from the brigades and allocation of costs following the year end. The first payment under the new system will be paid in June 2006. I have, at the banks&rsquo; request, agreed to defer the first payment to that date to meet the banks&rsquo; budgeting and accounting timeframe. In return for my agreement to this deferral, a transitional payment of &euro;1 million, payable before end 2005, was negotiated as part of the overall agreement. Therefore, in 2005 the banks made their annual payment of &euro;2.86 million plus the additional &euro;1 million making a total contribution of &euro;3.86 million. The costs for the banks in any future year will be determined by the actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of the cash escorts in the previous year and thus are not available at this time. The payments by the banks will be paid directly to my Department.</P>
        <P>We have now agreed a very open and transparent system for agreeing the costs in respect of the Defence Forces and this should stand the test of time. The agreement resolves the issue of the banks&rsquo; contribution in respect of cash escort costs for the foreseeable future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1430 and 1447 together.</P>
        <P>In common with most EU member states, Ireland has neither signed nor ratified the 1998 Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law. Only Estonia has ratified the convention to date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2001 the European Commission brought forward a proposal for a directive which comprised the main elements of the convention. The majority of member states opposed the approach of making a directive to provide for the necessary provisions on criminalisation. Accordingly the Council adopted a Framework Decision 2003/80/JHA of 27 January 2003 on the protection of the environment through criminal law. However this was subsequently annulled by the European Court of Justice on 13 September 2005 on foot of an action taken by the Commission that the aim and content of the framework decision in relation to the protection of the environment through criminal law were more appropriate to a directive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main objective of the framework decision had been to impose an obligation on member states to provide for criminal sanctions in the case of specified serious intentional or negligent environmental offences. It would have been left to the discretion of member states to decide on the level of penalties so long as they were effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully aware of the importance of effective deterrents for breaches of environmental law. In particular the provisions of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the Waste Management Act 1996 and the Water Services Bill 2003 provide for significant penalties for breaches of environmental law.</P>

	<P>The legislation governing compulsory land acquisition by local authorities provides for the payment of compensation for lands acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed CPO. The amount of compensation payable by local authorities for land acquired by them is solely a matter for negotiation between the landowner and the local authority concerned. In the event of dispute, either party may refer the case to the property arbitrator appointed by the land values reference committee.

        <P>My Department is co-operating with the Department of Finance, the decentralisation implementation group, and the Office of Public Works to ensure the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme is implemented efficiently and effectively. A decentralisation implementation team has been established to oversee the arrangements for the transfer of the Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based staff to four locations in the southeast, including Wexford and New Ross. Implementation plans, setting out the issues to be addressed in implementing the decentralisation programme for this Department, have been submitted to the decentralisation implementation group. These plans are also published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme my Department will transfer its headquarters, comprising some 249 staff, to Wexford town and a unit of 125 staff to New Ross.

        <P>At this stage a total of 112 staff within the Civil Service, including my Department, have confirmed their availability to move to Wexford. Thirty four of these are now in the Department and the process of agreeing arrangements for the early transfer of the others to the Department has commenced. The Office of Public Works, which provides the budget for the procurement of office accommodation, is evaluating site options at present. There is no proposal for any part of my Department to transfer to Enniscorthy.</P>

	<P>No request has been made to fund this project to my Department. As a protected structure on Kilkenny Borough Council&rsquo;s record of protected structures, the owners of the Rothe House would be eligible to apply to the council for a grant under the scheme of architectural protection grants which is administered by local authorities and resourced by my Department. The standard amount of grant is 50% of the approved cost of works, up to a maximum of &euro;13,000. A local authority may in exceptional circumstances determine an amount greater than the standard amount up to a maximum of &euro;25,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Funding for architectural heritage protection is also provided directly by the Heritage Council under its buildings at risk programme and the council also administers certain one-off grants directly on my behalf. In addition, tax relief is available under 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance or restoration of an approved building or garden where certain requirements regarding public access are met. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provided support for local authorities, civic trusts, and other not for profit bodies to upgrade buildings of significant architectural heritage merit and which are in public ownership or open to the public generally. This grant scheme is administered by my Department. The closing date for the 2006 scheme for the east region was 23 October 2005. Maximum funding available under the scheme is generally some &euro;30,000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In common with other EU member states, Ireland has an obligation to complete the designation of special areas of conservation for certain marine habitats and species. Following on this obligation, my Department has transmitted some 420 candidate SACs for adoption by the European Commission, of which more than 70 have a marine element and 28 were chosen principally for the wealth of their marine biological diversity. Criteria for selection of sites for certain marine habitats are still under scientific review at EU level. In the meantime <Col N="927"/>further designation proposals, focusing particularly on cold water coral reefs, are being prepared within my Department. Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, or the habitats directive, provides the basis for the selection and designation of SACs. As salmon is listed in the directive as a species for which sites are to be designated only in fresh water, migratory routes for salmon are not being considered in the selection of marine SACs.</P>

	<P>Statutory responsibility for the monitoring and management of water quality lies primarily with local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and, in relation to marine waters, with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Phthalates comprise a group of substances which are widely used in the plastics industry and which are of concern due to their potential endocrine-disrupting effects. The Environmental Protection Agency funded a survey in 2003 by Cork Institute of Technology on the occurrence of endocrine-disrupting substances in the Irish aquatic environment. The analysis of the results does not reveal any intersex, that is, the simultaneous presence of male and female tissue, in any of the waterbodies surveyed. A synthesis report will be issued within a few weeks and a full report will be issued later this year. The issue of the report had been scheduled for mid-2005 but delays occurred in its completion.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive screening programme began in March 2005 with the aim of establishing the relevance of over 200 dangerous substances, including phthalates, in the context of Irish waters. The programme will run for a period of 18 months and a report is expected in 2007. The programme, which is led by Carlow County Council on behalf of all local authorities, is co-ordinated by the EPA and funded by my Department. It is one of several projects by local authorities and other agencies to support implementation of the water framework directive. The results of the screening programme will inform the process of establishing appropriate chemical standards for Irish waters, and will be a major factor in determining whether further measures <Col N="928"/>will need to be taken to protect our waters from pollution by phthalates. Regard will also be had to the results of reviews being carried out in relevant international fora.</P>

This condition, which applies for a period of 20 years from the original date of the tenant purchase, requires a housing authority to satisfy itself that a person purchasing the house is in need of housing. The condition would also preclude the first resale of a tenant purchase house to a company operating equity release schemes. It would however remain possible for the owner of a tenant purchase house to take out a mortgage secured against the property.

However, before a proposal on the placing on the market of a product in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC comes to the regulatory committee for consideration, the European Commission, as a matter of course, consults the European Food Safety Authority regarding the product concerned.

        <Quest>the number of times the State has been requested by the EU or other EU member states to participate in responses to emergencies <Col N="934"/>with the provision of fire service personnel; the number of times these requests have been met fully; the number of times the State has failed to meet them fully and if so, the reason for same; his intentions to avail of the projects, workshops, training programmes, exercises and expert exchanges, and the funding for same available under the EU civil protection mechanism and community action programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the EU civil protection mechanism, when a request for assistance is received at the monitoring and information centre, this request is transmitted to all of the member states and offers of assistance are co-ordinated by the MIC and relayed to the requesting country. The requesting country then decides which offers, or elements of offers, to accept. Ireland participates fully in the EU civil protection mechanism. When a request for assistance is received by my Department from the MIC, it is examined in consultation with other Departments and relevant agencies and a decision is made on whether an offer of assistance can be made. While offers of assistance have been made on occasions, no such offer has in fact been taken up by the requesting country.</P>
        <P>There is no record of a specific request for fire services personnel as part of any disaster response. On one occasion, this country offered fire services personnel in response to a request for search and rescue personnel but that offer was not taken up by the requesting country; in practice, countries which regularly experience incidents such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, major forest fires and major floods tend to have significant contingency search and rescue capacity and are in a position to provide substantial resources to assist requesting countries at very short notice.</P><Col N="935"/>
        <P>Ireland is fully committed to participation in EU funded training programmes, exercises, and expert exchanges into the future; because of eligibility restrictions, the scope for participation has been limited up to now but these restrictions have now been lifted. EU training is essentially directed at team leaders and incident assessors and persons trained as team leaders or assessors will be expected to be available to assist in disaster relief if requested. Currently, two Irish nominees are due to commence the basic induction training course, which all potential team leaders and incident assessors must attend, and it is intended that that these persons will complete all of the modules in the coming months. It is intended that other suitable persons will be nominated to attend future training programmes.</P>

        <Quest>his plans to amend section 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 in view of the difficulties which have arisen for shared ownership purchasers of affordable housing with regard to the activation of the claw-back mechanism on re-mortgaging; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Houses sold under the various affordable housing schemes at a discount from market value contain a claw-back provision which is necessary to ensure there is no short-term profiteering on the resale of a house. Traditionally, local authorities were the sole supplier of mortgage finance for affordable housing and they registered the clawback as a charge on the mortgage deed, or in the case of shared ownership transactions, inserted it as a clause-condition in the lease. This allowed them, as the lender, readily to enforce the clawback.</P>
        <P>However, re-mortgaging a house that was initially acquired by way of shared ownership, requires that the purchaser buys out the lease, that is, acquires the local authority&rsquo;s share of the <Col N="938"/>house. To facilitate transactions of this kind, but also to ensure a clawback can be still operated by the local authority in relation to affordable housing, section 10(3)(<i>a</i>)(<i>i</i>) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 has clarified that the clawback must be paid &mdash; where a purchaser buys out the interest of the housing authority in the house. Since the enactment of this provision, a number of affordable houses acquired by way of shared ownership have been redeemed and these will have involved the payment of the clawback by purchasers to the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>By buying out the clawback and becoming outright owner the purchaser has the potential to trade on the open market or to release equity. To protect the State&rsquo;s interest in these affordable houses, I consider it appropriate that the claw-back mechanism should continue to operate in such cases and I have no proposals at this stage to amend the legislation. However, I will keep the matter under review.</P>

	<P>Substantial progress has been made in transposing the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, EPBD, by 4 January 2006, as follows: (1) Building Control Bill 2005, sections 4 and 5, published on 22 December 2005, provide for the part transposition of Article 5 of EPBD &mdash; consideration of alternative renewable energy systems during the design of large new buildings &mdash; and Article 7 of EBD building energy rating of buildings and public display of energy rating of large public service buildings; (2) Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2005 partly transpose Articles 3, 4, and 5 of EPBD; and provide the legal basis for the introduction of a revised building energy performance assessment methodology for new dwellings &mdash; this methodology expresses the energy performance of the building as a single parameter, CO<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>/m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>/ per annum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Details of these transposition measures were notified to the European Commission on 20 January 2006, together with details of proposed additional transposition measures in relation to Article 8 &mdash; energy efficiency of boilers &mdash; and Article 9 &mdash; mandatory inspection of air conditioning systems &mdash; to be adopted by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, by end March 2006.</P><Col N="939"/>
        <P Just="Left">All transposition measures have not been completed by 4 January 2006, due principally to the need to develop complex administrative and technical supporting implementation arrangements, as set out in the draft action plan for the implementation of the energy performance of buildings directive in Ireland, April 2005, which was sent to the Commission in May 2005 &mdash; a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library. This is a problem shared by most EU member states. I understand that, as at 4 January 2006, only ten of the 25 EU member states had notified the Commission of partial or total transposition of the EPBD. Article 15(2) of EPBD allows for the phased implementation of Articles 7 to 9, up to 4 January 2009.</P>

	<P>The procedures currently governing boundary alterations are set out in Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 and in the Local Government (Boundary Alteration) Regulations 1996. Under these provisions, it is open to a local authority to initiate a proposal for the alteration of its boundaries. This involves preparation of a formal boundary alteration proposal by the authority concerned including financial, organisational and other implications; invitation of public submissions and consultation with the other local authorities affected by the proposal, prior to submitting a formal application to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Cork City Council passed a motion in early 2005 requesting me to conduct a review of the city-council boundary with a view to extending the city boundary. In responding to Cork City Council in this regard, I indicated that it is open to the council to initiate such a formal boundary extension proposal locally, which would, in accordance with the comprehensive legislative process, ultimately be referred to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Any draft ministerial order to alter the boundary of any county or city would require a positive resolution by each House of the Oireachtas before coming into force.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that meetings took place between officials of my Department and the company in question in summer 2003 and that my predecessor, accompanied by officials, met representatives of the company early in 2004. At no point have I as Minister met with the company. There was no change in Government policy on waste management as a consequence of these meetings. The Department and I hold regular consultations with stakeholders in the context of the ongoing implementation of Government policy on waste management. This is designed to ensure that all concerns are understood and, where possible and appropriate, addressed.</P>
        <P>Concerns about the implications of restrictions on the movement of waste were expressed to the Department by stakeholders from both the public and private sectors. Most notably, the Environmental Protection Agency in its 2001 waste database report recommended that the inter-regional movement and treatment of waste &ldquo;should be provided for in appropriate circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s waste management policy statement Taking Stock and Moving Forward, April 2004, recognised that the prohibition on all inter-regional movements of waste could be unduly restrictive in terms of securing the development of waste infrastructure, and the objectives of local authority waste management plans. Most waste facilities currently in place are not subject to conditions which limit the geographic area from which they can take waste. In fact the absence of such restrictions has traditionally allowed local authorities to manage capacity constraints by providing for inter-regional movement of waste. Accordingly, the policy statement had provided for an examination of the issues arising in terms of the interrelationship between regional boundaries and waste facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I therefore issued a ministerial direction under section 60 of the Waste Management Act last year to recognise the need for inter-regional movement of waste last year where that supported the rational implementation of Government waste management policy. This was to prevent a situation arising whereby it would be legal to export waste to continental Europe, or further afield, for treatment but not across county boundaries within Ireland. Such a situation was completely contrary to the proximity principle and it would have been irrational to let it continue. Sound environmental policy required a more flexible policy and that is what my policy direction aims to achieve.</P>

        <P>I assume the questions relate to appointments made to State boards currently under the aegis of my Department.

In other cases only particular public office holders may be appointed to certain boards. In a number of situations, only some appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Inishowen regional water supply scheme was 23rd in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Donegal County Council in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to all local authorities in 2003 to undertake assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.</P>
        <P>The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 published in December 2005. Given the rating afforded to the scheme by the council, it has not been possible to include it in the current programme. I envisage that local authorities will be afforded an opportunity in 2006 to undertake fresh assessments of their needs and priorities, which can then be taken into account in subsequent phases of the programme.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The following table sets out the limited companies which received payments directly from the environment fund in 2005. These payments related mainly to grant aid, sponsorship and the provision of goods and services. Local authorities also receive allocations from the environment fund, and no information is available on any payments which they subsequently made to limited companies on foot of these allocations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>As a stand-alone measure, the amount available in the environment fund at any one time will depend on the inflows of money from the landfill and plastic bag levies and the expenditure on the various programmes which the fund supports. In this regard, it should be noted that surpluses in the fund at end year are not remitted to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>By virtue of a carryover of funds to the current year, the Revised Estimates volume will provide for environment fund allocations for 2006 which exceed the expenditure outturn for 2005. It will be possible to indicate percentage changes in allocations for the individual programme areas when detailed allocations for 2006 are finalised shortly.</P>
        <P>In addition to ongoing commitments from the environment fund, an additional &euro;10 million is being made available from the Department&rsquo;s Vote to support the delivery of waste recycling and recovery infrastructure. I have recently made very significant medium-term grant commitments towards the provision of this infrastructure, and overall commitments to this area are increasing.</P>

        <P>I understand the council is pursuing the procurement of a temporary water treatment plant pending completion of the substantive scheme. The operational costs associated with any such temporary plant will be considered in the context of the allocations to local authorities from the special local government fund assistance provided by my Department in recent years in respect of newly commissioned water services treatment infrastructure.</P>

	<P>In tandem with the commencement of section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in April 2004, which introduced a new registration system for quarries, my Department issued guidelines on quarries and ancillary activities to planning authorities. The guidelines, which were issued under section 28 of the Act, offer guidance to planning authorities on planning for the quarrying industry through the development plan and determining applications for planning permission for quarrying and ancillary activities. These guidelines also advise on appropriate conditions for attaching to planning permissions, to mitigate the environmental impacts of quarries.</P>
        <P>The decision as to whether to grant a planning permission in any particular case is of course a matter for the planning authority and my Department has no role in the matter. In making a decision on a planning application, a planning authority must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, relevant ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department and any submissions received.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to issue further regulations in this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers &mdash; manufacturers and importers &mdash; of farm plastics, silage bale wrap and sheeting, are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.</P>
        <P>Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste. The IFFPG is a not-for-profit organisation and it is a matter for the company, under the terms of this producer responsibility initiative and in accordance with the polluter pays principle, to set a rate of levy which will cover its operational costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The scheme has operated successfully to date. It is estimated that around 8,500 tonnes, some 55% of farm plastics placed on the market in 2004 were collected for recycling. An estimated 55,000 farmers availed of the collection service in 2004. IFFPG estimates that over 12,500 tonnes of farm plastics were collected in 2005.</P>
        <P>While responsibility for the collection and recovery of farm plastics rests with the compliance scheme, my Department monitors the scheme on an ongoing basis. I am aware of the specific issues raised and I am anxious to preserve and continue the success of the farm plastic scheme. Discussions are taking place involving my Department and IFFPG to explore options for improvement to the scheme and resolution of outstanding issues.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The recovery rates for wood and wood products in Ireland are <Col N="957"/>already very high. The National Waste Report 2004 of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, shows that 92% of the wood contained in municipal waste was recovered in 2004, leaving about 14,000 tonnes for landfill. The recovery rate for wood and wood products in manufacturing waste was 98%, leaving just 4,000 tonnes for disposal. Finally, the EPA calculated that 85.2% of construction and demolition waste was recovered, which includes a wood fraction, although detailed data on the latter are not available.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to promote measures to ensure the highest possible level of recovery of waste wood in Ireland, including through the national strategy on biodegradable waste, which will be published shortly, and the guidelines on construction and demolition waste which are currently being finalised.</P>

	<P>The EU directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, required each member state to introduce regulations providing for a producer funded take-back scheme for consumers of end-of-life equipment from 13 August 2005.</P>
        <P>The WEEE directive specifically excludes: equipment which is part of another type of equipment that does not fall within the scope of the directive, e.g. car radios; equipment which is connected with the protection of the essential interests of the security of member states, arms, munitions and war material; equipment which is not dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fields in order to work properly, e.g. gas cookers with an electronic ignition; equipment which is designed for use with a voltage rating exceeding 1,000 volts for alternating current &mdash; AC &mdash; and 1,500 volts for direct current &mdash; DC; luminaires in households, e.g. light stands; filament bulbs; large-scale stationary industrial tools; and all implanted and infected products in medical devices.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission has published a guidance document on the criteria for determining whether a product falls within the scope of the WEEE directive, a copy of which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie.</i></P>
        <P>WEEE is now being collected from over 180 collection points nationwide. While details of WEEE collected by product category or equipment type is not yet available, early indications are that significant quantities of this waste type are being returned for recycling. In the first 12 weeks alone 4,800 tonnes, equivalent to an annual rate of almost 20,000 tonnes, of household <Col N="958"/>WEEE was collected. This points to a fourfold increase in the recycling of household WEEE as 5,510 tonnes of this waste type was recovered in 2004 and indicates widespread public support for the implementation of the directive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been significant progress in recovery and recycling of waste in Ireland in recent years. The Government policy document entitled, Waste Management: Changing Our Ways, 1998, set a target of 35% for diversion of municipal waste from landfill by 2013. The National Waste Report 2004 of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, shows that the recovery rate for municipal waste in that year was 34%. Increases in recycling have been achieved as a result of a range of policies introduced and supported by my Department including the provision of recycling facilities &mdash; 1929 bring banks and 69 civic amenity sites &mdash; and the roll-out of segregated waste collection services. In addition, my Department supports improved waste management performance by public bodies and other large organisations through the Race Against Waste campaign which aims to raise awareness of waste issues and change behaviour at home and at work in order to reduce the amount of waste being produced and increase recycling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the campaign, an Action at Work programme was developed, in consultation with stakeholders, to provide advice to large organisations on how they can help staff and customers to reduce, reuse and recycle. An Action at Work pack was developed including material that set out specific actions, including segregating waste streams on site, that companies could take to improve recycling and help the environment. The programme also offers large organisations pro-active support through a helpline and nationwide seminars, run by waste management specialists, and tailored to each organisation. Information on this initiative is also available on the Internet at <i>www.raceagainstwaste.ie.</i></P>
        <P>In February of last year, I wrote to a number of large organisations, public and private sector, enclosing a copy of the Action at Work pack in order to further promote participation in the Race Against Waste by such organisations.</P><Col N="959"/>
        <P Just="Left">While street cleansing waste makes up a relatively minor proportion of municipal waste at less than 2.5%, placing segregated litter bins in prominent locations can play a role in encouraging greater awareness of the importance of recycling. I am aware that Dublin City Council, in partnership with Repak, has placed such segregated bins in a number of high profile locations in Dublin city centre. Notwithstanding this, such schemes have limited potential to contribute significantly to overall recycling rates having regard to the low proportion of municipal waste accounted for by street cleansing waste and issues concerning cross-contamination of dry recyclables,</P>

My Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy for 2005-07 incorporates an objective of promoting procurement management reform by developing policies, processes and practices in support of a more strategic approach to procurement within the Department and those bodies under its aegis. In response my Department has initiated steps to produce a corporate procurement plan as part of the strategic planning process for 2006.</P>

	<P>In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges and the provision of waivers are both matters for the relevant local authority where it acts as a service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.</P><Col N="961"/>
        <P>Waste management services traditionally have been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances. The present legal framework as determined by the Oireachtas reflects this. I do not consider it appropriate to propose a departure from these existing statutory provisions, which reflect the local nature of waste management services, by introducing a scheme of waivers in areas where the relevant local authority no longer considers it necessary to provide a household collection service.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1504 and 1505 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Local authorities and central Government are working together to comply with the polluter pays principle, as this is a core element of national and EU environmental policy, including in the area of waste management. In accordance with this policy, all of society must be encouraged to reduce, reuse and recycle waste to the maximum extent possible.</P>
        <P>To encourage households to minimise their waste, all local authorities and private waste operators were asked to begin a switch to use based charging arrangements from the start of 2005. In accordance with Government policy, as set out in Taking Stock and Moving Forward, collectors have discretion as to the types of systems to be used, provided that the key principle of use-based charging is respected.</P><Col N="962"/>
        <P>My Department understands that both Waterford County Council and Dungarvan Town Council have introduced new charging systems which comprise an annual standing charge, to cover the fixed costs associated with providing the collection service, coupled with a use-based charge per bin lift which varies in cost depending on the type of waste being presented &mdash; municipal, biodegradable or recyclables. The standing charge element of &euro;130 to &euro;150 per annum is seen as necessary to cover the fixed costs, for example, staff costs, truck, maintenance, insurance, transport to nearest landfill etc., of providing the weekly collection service to each customer. These fixed costs of providing a regular household service are incurred by the collector whether or not a bin is presented for emptying.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1507, 1508 and 1512 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes are intended, like a number of other housing grant schemes operated by my Department, to assist works which provide additional or adapted accommodation in private houses. However, they are not designed to cover the full cost of works for all applicants. Local authorities may provide reconstruction loans to qualified applicants who have difficulty in obtaining finance to meet the balance of the cost. The focusing of the scheme on real needs, both financial and accommodation-related and its <Col N="964"/>operation by local authorities in an efficient manner, will be critical in ensuring that it achieves its aim. The outcome of the review of the operation of the scheme which is at present being finalised in my Department will significantly contribute to this achievement.</P>
        <P>One of the primary aims of the review has been to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need of such assistance. The needs of applicants with limited means, including those dependent on social welfare benefits, have been considered in this light.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A combined capital allocation of &euro;73 million was made available to local authorities for the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes in 2004. Information provided by local authorities indicate that combined expenditure by them on the schemes in 2004 was &euro;55.4 million &mdash; &euro;45.8 million on disabled person's grants and &euro;9.6 million on essential repairs grants. Data are not yet available on the overall expenditure by local authorities on the disabled person's and essential repairs grants schemes for 2005. An overall allocation of &euro;74.5 million was made available for the disabled person's and essential repairs grants schemes in 2005. Data on expenditure on the schemes will be published in the Annual Housing Statistic Bulletin 2005 in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The following tabular statement gives details of the combined capital allocation for disabled person's and essential repairs grants notified to each local authority in 2004 and 2005 and the combined expenditure on the schemes in 2004 by each local authority.</P><Col N="963"/>

	<P>The cap on local authority staffing levels arose from a Government decision in December 2002 to cap public service numbers at the then existing authorised level and to reduce numbers across all sectors by the end of 2005. Numbers in the local authorities were to be reduced by 1,000 over that period. Returns of the number of persons employed by local authorities for the quarter ending December 2005 are not yet available. The Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement on 7 December 2005 that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to continue to regulate and control numbers in the public service, including local authorities, within agreed ceilings, and my Department will be maintaining appropriate contact with the Department of Finance in that regard.</P>

	<P>My Department is advised by the Irish Water Safety Association that there is no known world or European standard to designate a &ldquo;dangerous beach&rdquo;. The existing policy of completing risk assessments on all beaches that are used by the public with necessary follow up action by local authorities is considered to be the most appropriate approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Beaches by their nature are hazardous and depending on their usage are normally assessed for risk by a qualified and experienced risk assessor of the IWSA who will make a detailed report which will be forwarded to the relevant local authority for its follow up action. This action may be the erection of water safety signage, the provision of public rescue equipment, works such as installation of safety chains, ladders, steps, improvements to slipways, movement of boulders or sand and other engineering works according to the recommendations in the risk assessment report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Beaches change due to a change in environmental conditions and as a result of development. One of the qualifying criteria for a blue flag beach is that it must have been assessed for risk within the previous three years.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As part of a multi-annual programme to include the whole country, my Department carried out surveys of a sample of the architectural heritage of north Tipperary, Westmeath, Offaly, Kilkenny and Sligo under the national inventory of architectural heritage, NIAH, programme in 2004. The purpose of the NIAH is to identify, record and evaluate the country&rsquo;s post-1700 architectural heritage uniformly and consistently as an assistance to local authorities in the compilation of their record of protected structures, RPS, under Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The contractors undertaking NIAH fieldwork carry authorisation and identification which they are required to present on request and when entering on to private lands; they are also provided with documentation to explain the purpose of the survey to persons making inquiries. The Department does not publicly advertise the carrying out of specific surveys to prevent abuse by persons fraudulently passing themselves off as authorised officers; because the survey is field-based, it is not operationally possible to issue prior notifications to individual owners.</P>
        <P>Following submission of the 2004 fieldwork data, the material is in the course of being checked, edited and mapped in my Department. When this is completed, structures of regional or higher importance for each of these counties will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.buildingsofireland.ie.</i></P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government makes recommendations under section 53 of the 2000 Act to the relevant local authorities to include these structures in <Col N="970"/>their RPS. I plan to issue ministerial recommendations in respect of the 2004 surveys during the course of this year. The decision to include structures in the RPS is a reserved function of local authorities following the required notifications to owners of relevant properties and to the public under the 2000 Act.</P>

	<P>From the commencement of the single mandate for elective local government, local authorities were required to make specific arrangements to provide a reasonable level of service for Oireachtas Members and facilitate them in carrying out their work on behalf of local communities. These arrangements provide,<i> inter alia</i>, for the supply of specified documentation to Oireachtas Members by the local authority, and equivalent systems, procedures and timeframes to those used in relation to correspondence from local authority members apply also in respect of Oireachtas Members. Managers are required to meet at least annually with local Oireachtas Members and thus provide an opportunity for an update on developments and for any difficulties encountered to be raised and addressed. This is, of course, additional to normal and regular contacts between public representatives and local authority officials regarding particular problems or issues.</P>
        <P>My officials are engaged at present in gathering information from local authorities on the practical application of the scheme to date and arising from this, I will, if necessary issue supplementary guidance to local authorities taking account of the responses on the matter.</P>
