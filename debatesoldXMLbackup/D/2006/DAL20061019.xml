    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with several notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek leave to move a motion for the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance and concern, namely, the urgent need to support Dublin Bay Watch Limited, Clontarf, in its efforts to stop the 52-acre infill of Dublin Bay, to prevent Dublin Port&rsquo;s efficiency from being endangered by the encroaching city, the congestion that it brings, and the resulting capacity constraints, and to guard Dublin&rsquo;s wonderfully unique and historic bay and protect and preserve something that belongs to the Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to propose the Adjournment of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public concern, namely, the future funding of Tanagh Outdoor Education Centre in County Monaghan, which is operated by County Monaghan VEC.  The centre has acquired a tremendous reputation for the provision of services to over 10,000 customers from north and south of the Border.  They are currently mainly primary and second level students, and their numbers have increased over the past two years by 43% and 11% respectively.  There is a proven need for new premises to enhance existing services and provide new activities at the centre.  A five-acre site in nearby Dartrey Wood is available at a most attractive price agreed with Coillte and I call on the Minister for Education and Science to provide the sanction required to purchase that property, together with the modest sum of &euro;160,000 needed to secure the centre&rsquo;s future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the attention of Deputy Connolly and others to the length of submissions.  If they read Standing Order 31, they will see that they are supposed to be brief.  While I do <Col N="1882"/>not wish to enforce the rule, I request that Members shorten contributions under Standing Order 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent national and local importance, namely, the need to address contradictions between information supplied by the Department of Health and Children, regarding the employment of speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists, and the HSE, whereby the latter has claimed that services cannot be provided because of a lack of such staff, something borne out by lengthy queues.  The Department insists that there is no embargo on recruiting such personnel, but the effects are leaving vulnerable children without essential services at a critical time in their lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to request the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a specific matter of local and national importance, namely, the need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to introduce legislation immediately to empower ComReg to take urgent and effective action against disastrous telecommunications operators such as Smart and Perlico, which have made, and continue to make, life hell for their customers; and to ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to have the business of the House suspended under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent public importance, namely, the revelation by RTE news that between 70 and 100 families whose children were given blood products not properly screened for the hepatitis C virus are to be contacted; and the need for the Minister for Health and Children to determine exactly how the situation arose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the business of the House be suspended under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national interest, namely, the increasing energy, insurance and wage costs that are resulting in the loss of manufacturing jobs in this country, as evidenced by yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by Cadbury&rsquo;s of 450 job losses in Coolock.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann be adjourned under Standing Order 31 to deal with a matter of urgent importance, namely, to have a full debate on the serious questions regarding failures in Government policy raised by the Leas Cross nursing home report and the need for reforms to ensure that all nursing homes are fully accountable and properly resourced and that elderly people are properly cared for in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a <Col N="1883"/>matter of national importance, namely, the urgent need for the Government to outline what further action it intends to take to ensure the continued future of Aer Lingus as an independent airline and to block the proposed takeover by Ryanair, especially having regard to the consequences of such a move for the travelling public.</P>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting an Adjournment debate on the matter yesterday evening.  It was much appreciated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 17, the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages, to adjourn at 1 p.m. if not previously concluded; No. 3, the Nuclear Test Ban Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, resumed; and No. 18, statements on the Green Paper on Energy, in accordance with the order of the D&aacute;il of 10 October 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no proposals to put to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise two issues, the first being the single electricity market Bill.  Yesterday we had something of a wake-up call when a major flagship company, Cadbury&rsquo;s, announced 450 job losses.  One important factor is the cost of electricity, which is 30% more expensive here than in the UK.  There is something of a pattern, since waste management costs are 100% dearer, gas 20% dearer, and IT services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important that electricity services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.  The Chair will facilitate the Deputy in other ways in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I might make one point.  In the past five years, we have lost 150,000 jobs in exporting companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Standing Order relating to the Order of Business, which I can read to the Deputy if he wishes, is quite specific.  The Chair will facilitate the Deputy in raising the matter in a more appropriate manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a tradition in this House of showing a degree of flexibility on a <Col N="1884"/>Thursday morning if there are very significant issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no such tradition whatsoever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a pattern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Someone else was in the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, the Chair is bound by Standing Orders, the same as every other Member.  The Chair would be only too delighted if there was a change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not been here as long as the Chair, but I have seen a great deal more flexibility than is being permitted.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I might move on to the second matter, which concerns Professor Desmond O&rsquo;Neill.  When he reported on Leas Cross, he said it would be a major error to presume that the deficits in care shown there represented an isolated incident.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach told us yesterday that the health inspectorate Bill 2006 would put the social services inspectorate on a statutory footing.  There is no such Bill included in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.  The Bill that appears to provide for health inspections is the health Bill, which will not be published until 2007, no doubt after the general election.  I want clarity on this issue.  Will we see health inspections put on a statutory footing in the manner indicated by the Taoiseach before Christmas or will the matter be put on the long finger and not appear until some time in the distant future when we are in the throes of an election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to publish the single electricity market Bill this session.  A joint North-South process is involved and the exact timing of the Bill depends on agreement on some of the remaining issues.  It is proposed to publish the Bill this session.</P>
        <P>The Health Bill 2006 is the title of the Bill that will put the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is it on the list?  There is no Health Bill 2006 on the list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2006 Bill could be in 2007. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see.  The point is that the social services inspectorate already exists and, as the Taoiseach informed the House yesterday, considerable recruitment has taken place and significant resources have been applied to ensure <Col N="1885"/>the inspectorate is in a position to function adequately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I need clarification.  The only health inspectorate Bill 2006 that I could find was the Bill proposed by Deputy McManus.  Perhaps the Government intends to implement her Bill and if that was the case, I would welcome it.  The T&aacute;naiste must realise there is a legal problem with regard to closing down nursing homes and legislation is needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill in question is No. 54 in section C.  Its proper title is the Health Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to ask about the single electricity market Bill as I understand it is a major factor in the large-scale loss of jobs in Cadbury&rsquo;s.  Will the Minister reconsider the artificial model of competition we are creating when the electricity market&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.  Does the Deputy have a question related to legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>It might throw some light on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>As I explained yesterday, prices are being allowed to go through the roof in order to enhance profits to attract new entrants into the market so that there will be competition and prices can be reduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is provision for Leaders&rsquo; Questions on Wednesdays, but there is no provision for them on a Thursday.  Does the Deputy have a question on the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister look at the situation in the context of what has happened at Cadbury&rsquo;s?  Also, the House has collapsed three times already this session so why is there no serious legislation on the schedule for next week?  Why does the legislative channel appear to be drying up generally?  For example, the ombudsman Bill was promised for late 2003, but is not due now until early 2007.  The animal health Bill was promised for early 2004 and the Foyle and Carlingford fisheries Bill was due in late 2003, but it is not possible to say when they will be published now.  The minerals development Bill 2004 is now promised for mid-2007.  The pharmacy Bill 2004 is promised for this session.  The national monuments Bill, due in late 2003, the charities regulation Bill 2005, the nurses and midwives Bill 2004 and the judicial council Bill 2004 have been changed to 2007.  Is there a problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be a busy year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to permit discussion on this because we need answers.  We do not have any serious legislation coming forward.</P><Col N="1886"/>
        <P>The amendment to the ethics legislation is something close to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s heart.  When is the amendment likely to be published?  I think he was in the House yesterday when the Taoiseach betrayed complete bewilderment with regard to the commission&rsquo;s proposition requiring&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss the contents of what might be in the legislation at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true, but what I want to ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true as the Deputy rightly says.  Standing Order 26 applies to Deputy Rabbitte, the same as it does to the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that entirely.  It is nice to see the T&aacute;naiste here on a Thursday and not impeding the Taoiseach&rsquo;s schedule.  Will we have legislation to respond to the Public Offices Commission&rsquo;s request that the legislation be amended to allow it the right of inquiry and to initiate investigations as it thinks fit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter of the details of the legislation does not arise on the Order of Business. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there legislation to give effect to that request or does the Government still claim it does not know about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have dealt with the single electricity market Bill.  The Deputy will be in a position to explain fully where the Labour Party stands on the ESB and its reform in that context and I look forward to hearing an unequivocal explanation to the House as to what he really believes instead of his huffing and puffing here.</P>
        <P>With regard to the contention that there is no serious business in the House next week, it was agreed between the Whips last night that the Citizens Information Bill and the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be tabled for discussion next week.  These are serious pieces of legislation.  The National Oil Reserves Agency Bill is also serious legislation.  In addition, the House will, at the request of the Opposition parties, discuss suicide, which is important business.  There are 21 Bills on the A list and the Government intends to publish all of them.</P>
        <P>On the ethics issue, the Taoiseach explained at great length to Deputy Rabbitte yesterday what the Government had decided.  The suggestion that other matters with regard to the Public Offices Commission might be dealt with is something on which the Government has made no decision.  The Taoiseach indicated that if there was to be a change in the law, he would like to hear the case made for it.  I see in today&rsquo;s newspaper that informed sources say a considerable number of the commission have other ideas on the matter.</P><Col N="1887"/>
        <P>The Government will make its mind up on legislative proposals when it sees the proposals and the arguments made in favour of them.  We will not go down a road where a group of people sits in a room somewhere in Dublin and reads the newspapers and decides on the basis of what journalists publish that it will start investigations, without anybody having the courage to make a formal complaint.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Disgraceful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste would know about that.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I had wished to raise the matter of that particular legislation.  Shooting the messenger will not get to the heart of the need for ethics legislation.  The T&aacute;naiste should recognise there have been proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need to discuss the issue again.  Deputy Rabbitte has raised the matter and a response was given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unbelievable to hear the T&aacute;naiste say what he said.  The case has been made, including by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Deputy thinks would be appropriate on Second Stage of the Bill when it is before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The protection of employment (exceptional collective redundancies) Bill is more essential than ever.  The announcement by Cadbury&rsquo;s is even more reason to bring it forward urgently.  Is the promise of 2007 an indication it will happen before the general election?  Can the T&aacute;naiste clarify that Bills down for 2007 are now effectively not being promised because they will come after the general election?  In the context of 2007, can he give an indication of the difference between pre and after the general election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>A proposal to publish legislation in 2007 means what it says on the tin &mdash; 2007 is a 12-month period.  The way things are going, the general election should not be an impediment to these parties being in a position to tender all of these pieces of legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very holey tin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>How cocky can you get?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to see the T&aacute;naiste is pre-empting the electorate.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste about a landmark decision in the High Court this week which overturned the Deceased Wife&rsquo;s Sister&rsquo;s Marriage Act 1907.  When I raised this matter five and a half years ago with his illustrious predecessor, Deputy <Col N="1888"/>O&rsquo;Donoghue, I was told that the issues would be dealt with under the family law Bill which forms part of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, as announced by the Chief Whip on 25 January 2001.  In the absence of the Government doing its job, the people concerned had to go to the High Court.  What is the delay with the family law Bill and when will we see it published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not have much to say about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Stagg was offering yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was for the Taoiseach because he sent me a very nice letter arising from a question stating that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, would be in contact with me about the possibility of taking out the section from the communications Bill that deals with broadcasting to the Irish in Britain.  The Minister has not contacted me.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will talk to the Minister and he might contact me about the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy could read the Broadcasting Bill in the e-consultation process that is under way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The arrogance is catching.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Attorney General reported back yet on his consideration of the use of D&aacute;il privileges and means of publishing the full text of the report of the Leas Cross inquiry?  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that he is also considering the Dunne inquiry for publication in full by the same means?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, the Leas Cross inquiry report is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  It is not a matter for the Government to publish that &mdash; it is the HSE&rsquo;s report.  It is a matter for the HSE to take legal advice and decide on publication.  I am told today that the Health Service Executive hopes to publish the report &mdash; or nearly all of it &mdash; in the next couple of weeks.  It is taking independent legal advice on the matter.  It is not a question of the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion on this matter being relevant, it is for the Health Service Executive to form its own separate conclusion on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Dunne inquiry report on the retention of human organs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to deal with that.  I will communicate with the Deputy in writing in regard to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that a landmark decision was made by the Revenue <Col N="1889"/>Commissioners on refunding VAT to optometrists to the tune of &euro;50 million.  In light of this ruling to refund VAT on spectacles to optometrists and not to consumers, will the T&aacute;naiste indicate when the consumer protection (National Consumer Agency) Bill will be introduced so that we can have somebody standing up for the consumer?</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That legislation is due this session but I doubt it will deal with that particular chestnut.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who will deal with it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week it emerged that interest on SSIAs was being counted as means for third level grants.  Today there is a report that families are having to borrow heavily to put their children through third level education.  The third level student support Bill is on the A list to which the T&aacute;naiste referred.

	<P>A question does arise &mdash; if the idea has not receded into the dim distance &mdash; on delivering better government.  Does the T&aacute;naiste remember that concept?  It was big on the agenda a couple of years ago.  I refer to this in view of the energy costs that are now affecting us, as referred to by other speakers.  In view of the urgency of the situation, something must be done about this before it is too late.  Can the T&aacute;naiste indicate what will happen in regard to the minerals development Bill?

	<P>The parole board is functioning satisfactorily at present on a non-statutory basis.  The Deputy will appreciate we currently have other priorities.</P>
        <P>In regard to the St. Andrews agreement, the Attorney General is considering all of the issues which arise from that agreement, including whether any changes to or developments in the Good Friday Agreement would be of such an order as to require a constitutional process in this State.  That is an issue on which he will advise the Government when all of the outworkings of the St. Andrews agreement, including the legislative changes which will be coming forward at Westminster are to hand and we have a clearer picture of the extent of the developments and changes embodied in the process that was agreed between the parties.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 7, to delete &ldquo;(including statutory declarations)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I asked the Minister of State about this matter on Committee Stage.  Why are we putting elderly patients through the need to see solicitors or commissioners for oaths to get application forms signed as statutory declarations?  It would be an unnecessary burden.  The Minister of State stated on Committee Stage that this provision might be needed in some cases, but he has not clarified what proportion of cases would cause us to target elderly people in this way or make the system more bureaucratic.  Will the Minister of State give the House additional information?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not accept the amendments, both of which relate to the application process for subventions.  It is reasonable to request a statutory declaration, particularly if significant sums of money are involved.</P>
        <P>A statutory declaration may help a person to focus on the necessity to include all income assets and so on in his or her application.  This is a standard provision included in Bills.  While the measure provides certain powers, it would only be enforced in exceptional circumstances and not as a matter of course.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 was not accepted on Committee Stage because the Health Service Executive is obliged to act reasonably and fairly when processing applications, which it does.  It is not considered necessary to include the provision set out in the amendment.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 3 is in the names of Deputies Twomey and Gormley.  Amendments Nos. 3, 7, 12 and 16, which arise from Committee Stage, are related and will be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) (<i>a</i>) A person applying for a subvention, or a person acting on his or her behalf, may appeal, to an appeals officer designated by the Minister, on the grounds of&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="5">(i) his or her means and circumstances, or</P>
        <P LI="5">(ii) any abatement of the rate of subvention to that person of the maximum rate appropriate to that person&rsquo;s level of dependency, against a decision of the Executive&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="5">(I) not to pay a subvention, to pay a lower amount of subvention than the maximum rate,</P>
        <P LI="5">(II) to withdraw a subvention, or</P>
        <P LI="5">(III) to reduce a subvention, within 28 days of the date on which the Executive notified the person of its decision and the grounds for its decision.</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) The designated appeals officer shall consider an appeal under paragraph (<i>a</i>) and shall inform the person making the appeal of his or her decision within 28 days of the receipt of the appeal.</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) For the purpose of deciding the appeal, the designated appeals officer may request information from the Executive and from the person to whom the appeal refers or a person acting on his or her behalf.</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) A decision of an appeals officer shall be final and conclusive.</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>e</i>) Where the Executive has determined that a person does not qualify for a subvention, or qualifies for less than the maximum rate of subvention, it shall inform the applicant of his or her right to appeal the decision under this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">All of our arguments on Committee Stage centred on these amendments.  While I was expecting clarity from the Minister of State in the meantime, he only provided it in two respects.  The HSE&rsquo;s appeals procedure for nursing home subventions is not the new procedure we expected.  It states that an appeal is a request by a person for the re-examination of a decision made on his or her application for a nursing home subvention in respect of a refusal of the amount <Col N="1895"/>awarded under the 1993 nursing home regulations, but these regulations will be out of date once this legislation is enacted.</P>
        <P>My second piece of information concerning the Minister of State&rsquo;s thoughts is the press release we dragged out of him by making the charge that this legislation will force elderly people who live alone to sell their homes if they require subventions.  He stated that this matter has been agreed with the social partners.  Not only do I not know which social partners were involved in the discussion, but I do not know the views of elderly people&rsquo;s advocacy groups such as Age Action Ireland and the Irish Patients Association or whether they have spoken to the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>Not only is the legislation piecemeal and scattered, but the Minister of State is trying to take houses away from elderly people.  He has given no indication otherwise.  I tried to make sense of his press release, but he has his party leader&rsquo;s habit of talking in riddles.  It is the same old story.  While the Minister of State says the legislation will improve matters, it will copper-fasten provisions that make it difficult for elderly people to get subventions.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 relates to the HSE guidelines.  Deputies will traipse into the Chamber to vote on the Bill at 1 p.m., but is it realistic to expect us to do so before the appeal guidelines are published?  This is a disgrace.  This morning, Deputy Rabbitte stated the Government cannot put legislation together and the T&aacute;naiste told the House that the amount of work we will do in 2007 will be brilliant, but this legislation is not clear and the Minister of State refuses to answer straightforward questions.  He should not table such legislation until the guidelines have been published.  He has no social service inspectorate and no HIQA legislation.  The protections we are talking about for elderly patients, not only in nursing homes but when they are trying to get into nursing homes, do not exist.  I do not know whether these come under the amendments being discussed, but there are a number of other matters that have been highlighted here in this regard.</P>
        <P>When I first looked at this legislation, I assumed it was only elderly people who were living alone who were at greatest risk of having their house, of any value as opposed to of the value of &euro;300,000 in some areas and &euro;500,000 in others, taken from them.  Often I assumed they were the only people under threat.</P>
        <P>This also needs to be explained.  If an elderly person living in a house of substantial value with a daughter or son ended up going into a private nursing home, the State might force that son or daughter to sell that house.  The legislation uses the words &ldquo;could reasonably give rise to destitution or homelessness of a person having a close connection with the applicant for a period of not less than 12 months&rdquo;.  On giving rise to destitution <Col N="1896"/>or homelessness, the Minister of State might well state the value of the house is so high that if they downsized to a smaller house, that would not lead to destitution or homelessness.  Even a relative could be forced to move out of their house to a smaller house.</P>
        <P>The same applies with the financial assessments made on 50%.  That means the State will also possibly be looking at the income, for instance, of a gay couple living together.  The Minister of State has not made that clear either.</P>
        <P>What is going on here needs to be made crystal clear to everybody and that is why I will keep pushing these amendments until the Minister of State gives me a full and proper explanation.  I will wait to hear some of the Minister of State&rsquo;s answers on this.</P>
        <P>When he made a press statement last week, I went to the trouble of going through his Second Stage speech to see exactly whether he was making this clear.  He stated that I was wrong in some of my statements, but he is making it quite difficult here for elderly people and he must explain some of the matters which he did not explain clearly on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>There is one important point I want the Minister of State to make crystal clear for us.  On Committee Stage, he stated &ldquo;The principle of co-payment for long-term care is one that was accepted by the working group on long-term care which we established and is reflected in the social partnership agreement.&rdquo;  What does he mean by co-payment?  This is his opportunity to add clarity to this.  I do not want to hear any more about a Cabinet sub-committee looking at funding for long-term care of the elderly.  He is making that decision on this legislation.  He is taking the house from the person and this is the core principle of much of what he is talking about.  If the Minister of State is stating that co-payment is the way forward in funding long-term care, it is time for him to stand up and state exactly what is co-payment.  Co-payment, as the legislation stands, means basically that elderly persons who own their homes are in trouble when it comes to getting subvention.</P>
        <P>Since some of these regulations were more or less passed on to the HSE last Christmas we have been aware there are difficulties.  Some people are saying this is not being implemented uniformly across the country, but this legislation will make it apply uniformly and it will be a great deal more difficult for elderly people.</P>
        <P>In some respects, if this information is not disseminated from this Chamber, the Minister of State will get away with it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Deputy Twomey should not talk nonsense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>He knows that.  Unfortunately, some of the advocacy groups have not been saying as much as they could because perhaps they receive their funding directly from the Minister <Col N="1897"/>of State, which is another issue at which we should look.  We need to get clarity on this before his party colleagues come marching in here to vote on this at 1 o&rsquo;clock.  I will hear what the Minister of State has to say first before I pursue this issue further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the concerns expressed by Deputy Twomey.  There are many questions about this legislation.  Generally, there is not an argument about having some kind of rational, fair, humane system of assessing subvention across the country because at present it is quite clear there are variations that militate against individuals living in different parts of the country.  However, the one aspect we cannot accept is a regime that will be harsh on people who are vulnerable already.</P>
        <P>We must remember that the Government record on protecting the rights of the elderly, and making sure they feel secure and safe, is not good.  The illegal taking of money from residents in public nursing homes and public welfare homes extended over a number of Governments.  Nobody argues that point.  However, the record of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats is particularly shameful, both in terms of when this matter was first raised at a Cabinet meeting by a previous Government, the incoming Fianna F&aacute;il Government dropping the entire issue, and then the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, not reading his brief, or stating he did not read it, and nobody around him seeming to have the capacity to read a brief either, resulting in the bill increasing significantly and the taxpayer now paying the price.</P>
        <P>It should be pointed out that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, insisted on essentially privatising the payback scheme.  I was given a letter, which my colleague, Deputy Quinn, wrote in response to a constituent, which clearly shows that the payback scheme &mdash; one must remember this is elderly people getting back the money which was robbed from them &mdash; is not operating in an open and accountable way.  The letter Deputy Quinn wrote showed clearly that when a Member of this House went looking for simple answers about a scheme for elderly people, it was impossible for him to get the information and he wrote back to his constituent stating &ldquo;I really do not know how to help you because I cannot get the answers.&rdquo;  This person wanted to know when payment would be made.  In particularly tragic circumstances where the individual who is in a public nursing home is very ill, there is a certain urgency on it and none of the family can get answers.  That is quite disturbing.</P>
        <P>This is the Government that refuses point blank to publish a report on Leas Cross nursing home, which it promised would be published.  There is nothing to stop the Minister from publishing this report.  It should have been published long ago.  It was given to the HSE in May.  Under <Col N="1898"/>the Health Act, the Minister has the power to publish.</P>
        <P>The record is not good.  When we come to this legislation, there are legitimate concerns being raised by Deputy Twomey, others and myself about how people&rsquo;s income will be assessed and whether or not somebody with a family home is being penalised.  Given the provisions in the Bill, that is exactly what is happening.</P>
        <P>We should be clear about this.  Organisations which exist as advocates for elderly people are also expressing grave concern that this legislation will lead to elderly people being forced to sell their homes in certain circumstances.  One must remember that these are not necessarily elderly people who will remain in a nursing home forever.  They may become sufficiently well to move out again, but will not be able to do so because the family home has been sold to pay the bills.  Quite apart from compassion, there is no logic in that kind of scenario unfolding.</P>
        <P>It is important to put on the record what Age Action Ireland has to say about this Bill.  The Minister of State can say he is looking after the interests of the elderly but we must look to the advocates of the elderly who have a great deal of experience and a good track record and reputation in making sound judgments.  Age Action Ireland is urging that this Bill be amended because, if implemented, it will force a number of people to sell their homes or enter into equity release arrangements against their will.  The organisation makes a bald statement, with which I agree: &ldquo;Nobody should be forced to sell their home in these circumstances&rdquo;.  The head of advocacy and communications of Age Action Ireland states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Older people, many of whom have paid their taxes for 40 years, did so in the belief they had a social contract with the State which included provided for their basic health needs.  That contract cannot now be torn up.  In many cases, older people have spent their entire savings to pay their nursing home bills and their home is their last asset.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Age Action Ireland believes that people of all ages should be treated equally by the State when it comes to health care.  If a person in their 30s or 40s were to become to seriously ill, leaving them in need of nursing home care the rest of their lives, the state would not force them to sell their home.  Neither should older people in need of nursing home care.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Only five per cent of older people are resident in nursing homes.  Many of these would prefer to live in their homes, but are unable to do because of inadequately funded community care.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is important that we get this right and recognise there must be a fair system, which does not force people into taking actions contrary to their will.  However, there must also be a good, sound appeals system to make sure where somebody has <Col N="1899"/>not secured the right decision, he or she has the capacity to come forward and trust the appeals system in place.  The issue of the family home pervades the legislation, whether that relates to somebody else living in the home or the thresholds that apply to the value of the home, which are ridiculous.  It makes no sense that the threshold in Dublin is &euro;500,000, while the equivalent in Galway city is &euro;300,000.  Deputy Wall and the Minister of State are both from Kildare and the threshold of &euro;300,000 for that county makes no sense.  I live in Wicklow and a similar threshold applies but one would not buy a house for that amount in the county.  Once the value of the house exceeds the threshold, the entire valuation of the house is taken into account.</P>
        <P>I support the amendments.  They try to pin down a fair regime, for which the Government has not provided, but the core issue of the family home has not been addressed.  We need to deal with that if the legislation is to be fair.  We need to recognise the contribution made by elderly people and the necessity to provide services for them so that they can remain at home and, where they are unable to stay at home, to make sure they receive residential care.  Patients will be charged for residential care but proper safeguards will not be provided regarding inspections and a statutory-based system of safety.  That is not good enough and the Minister of State must take responsibility for where he is now.</P>

	<P>In welcoming this legislation on Second Stage, I contextualised my remarks saying they were being made on the understanding that we are examining placing the existing scheme or schemes on a sounder footing and providing for the current subvention arrangements in primary legislation so that the approach to them would be standardised across the State.  Those are important premises on which to make a judgment of the legislation.  Amendment No. 3 is tabled in this spirit because we want a sounder basis in every respect.  When I make a judgment call on legislation, and its intent is to improve, which it should always be, I am prepared to evaluate it soundly.</P>
        <P>Deputy Twomey&rsquo;s amendment seeks to do exactly that regarding the appeals process.  He is quite precise and particular.  The amendment states clearly, &ldquo;an appeals officer designated by the Minister&rdquo;.  That is a particular.  Somebody has a clear designation and responsibility and he or she will have the required training, credentials and experience to act in that capacity and undertake the role of an appeals officer.  What does the Minister of State propose?  The proposed new section 7E(3) states, &ldquo;Where the Executive receives an appeal under subsection (1), it shall appoint a person (who may be an employee of the Executive) to consider the appeal&rdquo; while section 7E(4) provides that the person appointed pursuant to subsection (2) to consider an appeal <Col N="1900"/>under subsection (1) shall comply with guidelines, consider any written or oral objections, make a decision and send a copy of the relevant decision to the relevant person and the executive.  I am concerned that the preparation of the legislation in regard to the appeals process is weak and open to abuse and misuse and is, in no way, firm or directional.  Appointing a person, perhaps an HSE employee, who must comply with the guidelines, consider objections, make a decision and forward a copy of the decision means there is a huge gap between the legislation, which is before us for final consideration, and the amendment tabled by Deputy Twomey, which is quite specific that an appeals officer, not simply &ldquo;a person&rdquo;, shall be appointed.</P>
        <P>On receipt of an appeal who will be appointed?  It could be a case of Johnny or Mary running by and, because he or she is not doing anything, being asked to take the appeal and make sure he or she complies with the guidelines, consider any written or oral objections, make a decision and send it to the relevant person.  Where in the wording will people find confidence, assurance and the certainties that are required?  On Committee Stage, the Minister of State responded to these proposals by saying appellants would have recourse to the courts.  We do not want to commend such a course to them.  We want to recommend to them a safe, sound and solid basis for appeal within the system.  That is not clear in the legislation.  It requires to be addressed and it absolutely requires amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 meets the criteria necessary to give the required assurance to people that a proper appeals mechanism is in place.  I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider his rejection of the amendment on Committee Stage.  Nothing he said at the time gives me an understanding of the reason he and his colleagues in the Department rejected this reasonable, important and necessary amendment.</P>
        <P>My hope is that the Minister of State will not trundle out the same inadequate responses he did on that occasion.  They simply do not measure up to the requirement.  This Bill, if it is to proceed on the basis the Minister of State commended to the House up to this point, will be significantly flawed and open to abuse by officials and those who would be more dilatory in their approach to their responsibilities within the system.  Public confidence will be sorely and severely affected as a result.</P>
        <P>One role we, as elected voices, have is to act as a buffer between the system and the people.  If this wording stands and becomes the substantive wording within the final, passed legislation, how can we put our hand on our heart and claim we have confidence in it and commend it to our respective electorates?  We cannot do so.  The wording requires address.  The issues other speakers and I have articulated to the Minister of State during the debate must be taken on board.</P><Col N="1901"/>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment in the spirit of ensuring the best legislation and meeting the criteria I laid out in my considered welcome of this legislation on Second Stage, namely, that it seeks to place the whole subvention process on a sounder basis.  That must be the objective.</P>

	<P>That is okay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will be delighted to know that.  The message is clear.  A proper appeals mechanism is required, as far as the Opposition is concerned.  I appended my name to the amendments because I do not see provision for such a mechanism in the Bill.  In any system we need to have fairness and justice, and also what we call a separation of powers so the same people who are making decisions in regard to subventions are not those who will make later decisions.  The amendment is based on common sense and I do not know why the Minister of State would reject such a sensible provision.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support the amendment put forward by Deputy Twomey.  The Bill has worried me from the beginning.  I have at every opportunity tried to create interest in it among various groups from the perspective of members of the public pressuring elected representatives in their home areas as to the magnitude of the concern this measure will cause among senior citizens.  It is not correct to accept that the only means available to a senior citizen is to go to the courts in this regard.  At the time a person is seeking nursing home subvention, that person is at his or her weakest.  People are seeking assistance and do not want to have to get a court decision with regard to means for nursing home subvention.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the difference in the valuation of houses.  As the Minister of State knows, virtually every applicant for nursing home subvention in County Kildare would exceed the &euro;300,000 bracket due to the valuation of houses in the county.  There is no doubt the limit is not high enough or reflective in any way of the valuation in houses in the Kildare area, where the Minister of State and I are public representatives.</P>
        <P>Cases where the residential home becomes excluded with regard to its valuation are also of deep concern.  For example, a single parent residing with a father, mother or other loved one and who is taking part in a VTOS course would be excluded from the assessment of the valuation of the house.  How in God&rsquo;s name can we make a decision that a house could be sold without reference to a single parent who is trying to better himself or herself, just because he or she is in receipt of extra payments and has gone outside the assessment valuation figure?  How can we sug<Col N="1902"/>gest that the Bill properly covers such aspects if we do not include a proper appeals mechanism to allow such cases to be determined and evaluated?  That is the nature of this measure.  A person on a single parent allowance is not included, which means his or her home would be excluded from the valuation.</P>
        <P>The same could be said with regard to a carer.  A person could have minded a parent for 20 years and arrived at a position where he or she could not care for the parent any longer.  When the parent entered the nursing home, the son or daughter would no longer be a carer and might obtain employment.  If, as a result of the employment, he or she moves outside the limits of the very tight exemptions, the family home could be sold over that person&rsquo;s head, despite the fact he or she had looked after the parent in that home for 20 years.  The position is the same for anyone on low income and not in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance who works and then goes home and cares for a loved one.  If nursing home subvention is needed, the house could be sold over that person&rsquo;s head.</P>
        <P>There is no logic to trying to deal with the family home in this way.  The entire Bill is frustrating and destroys the one thing we all consider most valuable, namely, the family home.  As I stated previously in the House, no legislation should provide that the family home is included for assessment.  It is one value we possess, the one pearl in our crown, and it should not in any way be used in the valuation mechanism.</P>
        <P>If we do not put a proper mechanism in place, we will cause concern across the spectrum among those seeking nursing home subvention.  They will not seek subvention because they will feel that the family home for which they worked so hard and which they want for themselves and their children will be sold over their heads just to get them into a nursing home.  There should be no connection between the assessment of a family home and a person trying to access medical care.  The family home should be excluded from any assessment in this regard.</P>
        <P>I would like clarification from the Minister of State with regard to the assessment of the degree of dependency, a matter I fail to understand.  If I were to attempt to obtain nursing home subvention for a loved one or parent, I would contact a matron, director of services or director of nursing in the nursing home to tell them I was seeking a placement.  The official would tell me the cost was, say, &euro;700, as it currently is in my area.  There are three different aspects of dependency but the owner of the nursing home will not ask an applicant the category of dependency he or she has because one&rsquo;s level of dependency is reflected in the cost of one&rsquo;s care.  If an applicant&rsquo;s nursing home subvention is &euro;700, it will be that amount regardless of the applicant&rsquo;s category of dependency.  Those who grant the subvention will not relate it to the applicant&rsquo;s level of dependency.  Given the different categories of dependency <Col N="1903"/>identified in nursing home care and the mechanism to be put in place under this legislation, the cost of nursing home care will be greater for some families than for others for the simple reason that a resident in a nursing home can shave himself.  It is unthinkable that we would deprive a person of something because he can shave himself.  It is the Government and not the nursing home that is effectively saying that a person who can shave himself will have to pay more for his care.  There is no logic to requiring that a person must pay more out of his own pocket for care because he can shave himself and go to the toilet without assistance.  That is what this legislation is effectively saying and I do not see a way around that.  I have yet to receive word from a nursing home that because an applicant, be it a parent, brother or sister, has medium dependency the cost of his or her care will be lower.  That does not happen.  I cannot understand the logic of categorising a person who needs nursing home care -the person would not have submitted an application in the first instance if he or she did not need care &mdash; and charging them more for such care.  The cost of such care will have further financial implications for that person&rsquo;s family for the simple reason that person can walk to the toilet without assistance, shave himself and look after himself.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must put in place a mechanism to allow an applicant to appeal under the normal criteria.  I have spoken here on numerous occasions on the effect of the social welfare appeals system.  The inspectors there are a credit to the system.  I have attended more appeals than I can almost count and on leaving them the person I accompanied has said on every occasion that the appeal was not bad, that the appeals officer did a good job and gave the person every opportunity.  We are not giving the most vulnerable people in our society, namely our senior citizens who are responsible for us achieving what we have today, that opportunity in this legislation.  I fully support the provision of the appeal system proposed by Deputy Twomey.  This opportunity must be available to people.</P>
        <P>The option of going to court is not a runner because in many cases they suffer from dementia or the early onset of it.  Therefore, they do not know about the court system nor do they want to know about it.  Even if a person&rsquo;s family mentions that the court option is the only way to appeal a decision to try to save the family home, the person will not want to know about it.  They will want to stay at home and create further problems for those who have cared for them for so long.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to give due consideration to this amendment.  If accepted, it would allow people the due process of appeal under a properly orchestrated mechanism and allow them to make every effort to obtain what is a necessary payment, given the value of the nursing home subvention.  In my area it has increased from &euro;500 to &euro;750 and is rising.  The cost of providing nurs<Col N="1904"/>ing home care for one&rsquo;s loved one is outside the means of a person on an ordinary income.</P>
        <P>In regard to the family home, I stress as I have previously, that the home is the one asset an old person has, with all that means to the person.  Consideration of it should not be even included in the legislation.  Notwithstanding that, I ask that due consideration be given to accepting amendment No. 3.</P>

	<P>I thank the Members for their contributions.  I will deal with the issue raised.  Some people have accused me of saying things I did not say, but that is not unusual in this House.</P>
        <P>I want to make it clear that I never indicated at any stage that this Bill would be the be-all and end-all and that it would bring about major changes.  I explained at the outset that we had taken advice from the Attorney General.  That advice was that the scheme had operated by way of regulation since 1993 and that it was important that it be put into primary legislation.  That is exactly what we are doing.  I did not indicate that we were making any major change to the scheme.  A number of small changes and adjustments are being made but by and large the operation of the scheme when the legislation is enacted will be similar to the operation of it prior to its enactment.  To say the introduction of this legislation will force old people to sell their houses misrepresents the situation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation is not being brought forward in lieu of the publication of the report of the interdepartmental group on long-term care.  This group reported to Government, which has agreed on a number of principles.  These were reflected in the agreement with the social partners, Towards 2016.  Such principles include appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment and that the level of State support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is being provided in a public or private facility.  The co-payment, about which Deputy Twomey asked me, has existed for a long time.  If one is being cared for in a public bed and one is in receipt of a pension, a percentage of one&rsquo;s pension is taken as part payment for the care one receives.</P>
        <P>I mentioned on Committee Stage the details of the scheme.  I accept it is far from perfect.  It was introduced by way of regulation in 1993.  Like <Col N="1905"/>Deputy Wall, I am familiar with many applicants and families who apply for subvention and the difficulties they encounter in obtaining it.  In many cases the subvention payment granted covers only a small percentage of the overall cost of care and I know the burden that places on families.  It is for that reason that we set about introducing a new long-term residential scheme.  We hope to do that in the near future, but in the interim we were advised to put this measure into primary legislation.  That is what we are doing.</P>
        <P>The talk of the inclusion of the family home in the legislation is a little rich.  The Minister who introduced the regulations in 1993 was Deputy Howlin.  The home was included at that stage and with the exception of a subsequent Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, who revoked certain aspects of that scheme, very little change has been made to it.  We all appreciate that a new scheme is required and, hopefully, we will be in a position to introduce that in the near future.</P>
        <P>None of these amendments was accepted on Committee Stage because the Bill provides for one single appeals process and it is not considered necessary to include a separate appeals provision under each section of the Bill.  The appeals provision in section 7(<i>e</i>) provides for a most robust and transparent appeals procedures in accordance with legal advice received and in compliance with article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The appeals process provides that a person can appeal any decision made by the HSE in regard to a decision on a subvention under section 7(<i>a</i>)(iii), 7(<i>c</i>)(i) and (iv) and 7(<i>d</i>)(ii).  Under the appeals provision at section 7(<i>e</i>), the person appointed by the HSE to consider the appeal must comply with the HSE&rsquo;s guidelines in respect of procedure.  I have a copy of those guidelines if Members wish to have them.  I made some copies of them available yesterday.  Much of the criticism thrown at the HSE in regard to appeals is unjust.  The HSE has advised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>

	<P>When I asked if guidelines were in existence, the Minister of State told me the HSE would produce them.  There are no guidelines.  As we outlined with regard to section 7E, the HSE has no guidelines&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I was coming to that point, if the Deputy would just listen.  He may have tabled the <Col N="1906"/>amendment but other Deputies also spoke and asked questions and it is appropriate that I reply to them as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This was the first question I posed.  It is not asking too much that the Minister of State answer it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE has advised the Department that a new appeals process and associated guidelines will be in place within eight weeks.  It is unlikely that there will be significant changes in the current appeals process on foot of this Bill.  The HSE has advised that the current appeals officers will continue to consider appeals under the new system.  It has advised that a single appeals process will be in place throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I draw Deputies&rsquo; attention to the fact that individuals will now have 60 days to make an appeal, as opposed to 28 days under the current system.  It is considered that the provisions currently contained in the Bill provide for a fair, transparent and robust national appeals system.  Therefore, it is not considered necessary to make any amendments to them.</P>
        <P>The appeals system is similar to that which operates for social welfare claims.  We are quite clear on the guidelines and thresholds.  People will have a reasonable idea before they make an application as to whether it is likely to be successful.  Having more than one appeals provision in the scheme would be unusual and unnecessary.  I am not in a position, therefore, to accept the proposed amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State said the system is similar to that which operates in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  However, as I understand it, the appeals system provided for under this legislation is a written system.  The appeals system in the Department of Social and Family Affairs involves an oral hearing where an appellant appears before an inspector, who is totally independent of the Department.  Therefore, it is incorrect to say the appeals systems are similar.  Under the system operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs an appellant can bring a public representative, solicitor or family member to the hearing, sit down with the inspector and tease out the problems.  I have always praised the appeals system for social welfare claimants precisely because it allows people to tease out problems.  My understanding of the legislation before us is that the appeals process is a written system that is not in any way comparable to the social welfare appeals system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Forcing elderly people to sell their homes to pay for health care is an incredible policy decision for a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister to make.  This issue was not discussed in the D&aacute;il.  I do not know which of the social partners allowed this decision to go through and the Minister of <Col N="1907"/>State has not told us what social partners agree with him on this issue.  This is not about regulations.  The Minister of State referred to Deputy Howlin introducing regulations but those regulations were very much implemented at the discretion of the chief executive officers of the health boards at that time.  The health boards had an enormous amount of latitude.  As a Government Minister pushing through legislation, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power should know that what he is doing here is framing the law.  It is not just some regulation or something that can be changed again on a whim.  This is legislation and if the Minister of State cannot understand the difference between legislation and regulations, he should not be in the position he occupies.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has been promising people that they will not have to sell their homes but by next May she may not even be in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  She certainly will not be in Government.  We will be left with blankety blank Fianna F&aacute;il people or maybe an Opposition that cares about what happens to elderly people.</P>
        <P>Right now the Minister of State is not giving any protection to elderly patients, who will be forced to sell their homes.  He has not answered the fundamental question.  It is not a matter of &euro;300,000 or &euro;500,000 for a home in Dublin; it concerns any home.  It is 5% of any house of an elderly person living alone.  If the Minister of State examines the criteria concerning means, which he surely has done, he knows it will not take a very expensive home before people begin to come under pressure.  I estimate that at anything over &euro;100,000 people will be forced to sell their homes.  When they run out of funds they will then have to apply to the HSE for subvention.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is telling me to rely on the HSE.  Any company that is properly run writes and publishes a corporate governance policy.  Can the Minister of State tell me when the HSE&rsquo;s corporate governance policy was published?  The HSE has been in operation since 1 January 2005.  I ask the Minister of State, who oversees the HSE, to tell us when that policy was written.  Then he can tell us to trust that the HSE will bring forward guidelines in six weeks.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is being disingenuous and is trying to throw out untruths about the Opposition.  He knows as well as I do that what he is doing with this legislation is going after the homes of old people.  He is trying to slip out of it but has been caught out.  He tried to slip out of it on Second Stage and on Committee Stage but he got caught out.  He is trying to slip out of it again in the House today but we will call votes all morning to see if Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers will learn to understand.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the points other Deputies have made with regard to the family home.  I will not repeat them because they have <Col N="1908"/>been well made.  The Minister of State has not responded to the salient points I made in my earlier contribution regarding the deficiencies in the provision in section 7E on page 12 of the Bill as presented at this stage.  This is important because the Minister of State has drawn comparisons with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The appeals office for social welfare claims is independent of the Department but what the Minister of State is proposing here is different.  One must look at the formulation of words.  The Bill states that &ldquo;Where the Executive receives an appeal&rdquo; &mdash; which is almost suggested as an improbability &mdash; &ldquo;under subsection (1), it shall appoint a person (who may be an employee of the Executive) to consider the appeal.&rdquo;  </P>
        <P>Deputy Twomey&rsquo;s proposed amendment states very clearly that the appeals officer, as opposed to a person appointed to examine an appeal when it presents, is designated by the Minister and not by the HSE.  Where do we ever draw the line on the police policing themselves?  Here we have the HSE acting as it may in terms of appointing an employee of the executive to consider an appeal.  It should be at some remove from that.  Amendment No. 3 clearly states &ldquo;designated by the Minister&rdquo; and not by the HSE.  This is another very important point in ensuring public confidence.  That is what is required and it is absolutely necessary.  I understand that is the way the social welfare appeals system operates.  Let us recognise the deficiencies and not try to defend the indefensible.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that this Bill is not the be-all and end-all and quite clearly, that is the case.  Let us at least ensure that key and critical elements of this legislation meet the requirement of providing a sounder basis than that which has previously applied.</P>

	<P>The appeal system is quite similar to the system operating in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  In this case we appreciate that in many cases, the people on behalf of whom subventions are being made might not necessarily be in a position to make the application themselves.  For that reason we have the facility where family members or friends can make an application on their behalf.</P>
        <P>I will make a couple of points about the scheme.  The first relates to people dealing with the appeal having to comply with guidelines issued by the HSE in respect of procedures to be followed relating to the consideration of any appeal.  I have stated that the HSE has advised that the new appeals process and associated guidelines will be in place eight weeks from now, not six weeks.  An appeals officer would have to consider any written or oral objections made by the appellant in support of the appeal.</P>
        <P>We are not trying to encourage people down the legal route, but we must make that available <Col N="1909"/>to them or their families in the event they are not happy with the existing appeals system.</P>
        <P>I have been honoured to be elected to occupy a seat in this House since 1989.  I have sat on both sides of the House, and I have felt privileged to have the opportunity.  If I am fortunate enough to be re-elected after the next election, I will not be changing my jersey, whatever about my seat.</P>
        <P>Members have mentioned the selling of homes.  By bringing in this legislation we are not forcing anybody to sell their home.  There was a comment earlier about Age Action Ireland.  That group has acknowledged on its website that my colleague the Minister, Deputy Harney, has stated that individuals would not have to sell their homes to fund nursing home care.  That still remains the case.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that we are not forcing anybody to sell their homes.  By introducing this, we will bring into primary legislation something which has existed by way of regulation.  It was introduced by the Deputy&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Howlin, when he was Minister for Health.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not delay the House too long.  I wish to contribute in particular to the question of the family home.  We should remember who we are dealing with on the issue of subvention for nursing homes.  We are dealing with elderly people who over the past 20 to 60 years have contributed to what we now enjoy.  They have contributed to the building of the Celtic tiger, and in their old age are entitled to a fair crack of the whip.</P>
        <P>In very many cases these people are medical card holders who are effectively being forced from our hospitals into private nursing homes because there are not enough public beds in our system.  The vast majority of people in private nursing homes are not there by choice.  They would rather either to remain at home or go to a public facility.  The fact remains that these people, in very many cases medical card holders, are deprived of the opportunity either to remain in their own homes or avail of publicly-funded facilities because there are not enough beds available.</P>
        <P>We are also considering the most vulnerable people at a vulnerable and pressurised stage in their lives.  It is a time when their families are under severe pressure of all kinds.  I deal with people on a daily basis, as I am sure every other Deputy does, where relatives inform us they have to take their relative, mother or father out of the local hospital and there is no bed available in the geriatric facility.  These people are faced with paying huge sums in private nursing homes.  The vulnerable people are not just the individuals themselves, but their families.</P>
        <P>The family should be completely excluded from this legislation.  There are clear precedents.  The whole social welfare system excludes the family home on any assessment of financial needs.  The medical card system itself excludes the family home from any financial assessment.  It is only right, just, fair and decent that the family home be excluded from the subvention issue.</P>
        <P>What is contained in this Bill worsens the issue in regard to the family home.  Currently, the Health Service Executive has discretion to exclude the family home.  To be fair, it does so in many cases, having regard to the circumstances.  If this legislation is passed in the current form, it will exclude this discretion.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Twomey has stated, we would then be dealing with legislation which must be implemented.  Officials from the Health Service Executive will have no discretion whatever in excluding the family home.  Those circumstances will mean family homes will have to be sold, as there will be no discretion.  In numerous cases the <Col N="1911"/>homes will have to be sold to fund elderly people in nursing homes.</P>
        <P>With regard to the exclusions, I am currently dealing with a case where a son over the age of 21 is living in a family home.  This man is in a low-paid job and is barely getting the minimum wage.  He will be excluded under these regulations, and he will effectively have to pay, despite being on a very low income and living in the family home where he was born and raised.  There is also the situation raised by Deputy Wall, which involves a single parent, a carer, or somebody on a community employment scheme being excluded under the details of this Bill.</P>
        <P>In very many cases, the family home may have fallen into disrepair over a long number of years.  In some cases, to get over the problem of a family home being vacant, the owner &mdash; the elderly person &mdash; may be in a position to rent it.  In many cases, homes that have a significant value because of location or size, for example, may be in a state of disrepair and so cannot be rented.  Currently, Health Service Executive officials have discretion to exclude the family home, but that will not be the case if this Bill goes through in its current form.  I appeal to the Minister of State to exclude the family home from the legislation and, accordingly, to accept Deputy McManus&rsquo;s amendment No. 6.  It is most unjust to elderly people, who built up this country over the years and of whom many are medical card holders forced into private nursing homes because of the lack of public facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, the Minister of State will not answer my questions.  He will not answer the question I asked him about the corporate governance of the HSE.  He will not tell us whether we are right or wrong that the legislation refers to a house of any value, so obviously he accepts we are right.  </P>
        <P>Given that the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Harney, have been in the Department of Health and Children since June 2005, has <Col N="1912"/>he read the Leas Cross report?  He takes the attitude of &ldquo;See no evil, hear no evil&rdquo; and believes if he plays dumb he will get away with it.</P>

	<P>He sounds like the Taoiseach in waiting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not acceptable.  The Minister of State hopes he will get away with ramming this legislation through, believing he can tolerate a couple of bad days in the process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Get away with what?  The Deputy is talking rubbish. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State does not know what he is doing.  He has not read his own legislation.  I have pored over the legislation to check whether I have been wrong but all the Minister of State does in response is issue press releases.  He did not respond to my questions on Second Stage, on Committee Stage or in the House today.  He will issue a press release at approximately 3.30 p.m. today, hoping that will be the only response necessary to the difficult questions being asked of him in the House.  He has done that since last May.</P>
        <P>We have pored over this legislation and make the assumption that an elderly person, living alone or with somebody over 21 who has any significant income, will lose his or her house whatever the value.  The Minister of State has not challenged that assumption at all during the course of this debate.  He bluffs us with regulations and tells us to trust the HSE.  It is a disgraceful way for a Minister of State to conduct himself when pushing legislation through the House.</P>
        <P>I understand why the T&aacute;naiste this morning spoke about legislation passing through this House.  The Government has probably the worst record in recent years for having legislation thrown out by the Supreme Court.  Now we are dealing with legislation that the Minister of State cannot fully explain to the Opposition.</P>

	<P>I wish to comment.  My amendment addresses a fundamental issue in the Bill.  It is irrational that, on the one hand, my amendment which sought to exclude the principal residence from an assessment is disallowed, while, on the other, several amendments which have a financial impact are not excluded.  All the Deputies who spoke in this debate raised this fundamental issue, yet we are not allowed to discuss an amendment which has been included in the list because it is such an important issue.  It is incongruous not to debate the most important issue at the heart of this Bill on foot of an amendment while other surrounding issues are discussed. </P>

	<P>Amendment No. 8 arises out of Committee Stage proceedings.  Amendments Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive, are related and may be taken together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, line 7, after &ldquo;the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Greater&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to include reference to the &ldquo;greater Dublin area&rdquo; as opposed to the &ldquo;Dublin area&rdquo;.  Section 7C (4)(<i>b</i>)(i) specifies a distinction between two specific groups of people, those who live within the &ldquo;Dublin area&rdquo;, for whom a cut-off limit of &euro;500,000 on the value of the family home applies, and those who live outside the &ldquo;Dublin area&rdquo;, for whom a limit of &euro;300,000 applies.  I asked the Minister of State about this on Committee Stage and he told me that the term &ldquo;Dublin area&rdquo; is used by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in reference to house prices.</P>
        <P>If such a major distinction is to be made between the Dublin area and the rest of the country, we need something more accurate than this.  This uncertainty will give rise to situations where houses on one side of the street in a borderline area are eligible for the higher threshold while those on the other side fall into the lower threshold category.  Some towns that have a case for inclusion will be excluded from the higher limit.  During the debate on this issue on Committee Stage, Deputy McManus asked whether Wicklow or Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, for example, are included.  Does it encompass the commuter zone of the greater Dublin area, which includes counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, as well as parts of Carlow, Wexford and Louth?</P>
        <P>We must have clarity on this point before the legislation is enacted and implemented.  I am aware there are no regulations from the HSE in this regard and that the Minister of State is not sure whether the homes of elderly people will be taken from them.  There must be certainty as to the precise scope of the area to which the higher threshold applies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Acting Chairman, Deputy Glennon, has indicated to the Minister of State but he will find there are other Members who wish to speak on this amendment.  I understand the Acting Chairman is now more relaxed and I wish him well in the future.</P>
        <P>This is an important issue that must be addressed if there is to be any justice in terms of assessing the income of elderly people.  The Bill provides for a differentiation in terms of the valuations of family homes.  A house that is worth less than &euro;500,000 in the Dublin area will be excluded from assessment whereas the threshold is &euro;300,000 for houses elsewhere.  I do not know <Col N="1918"/>on what planet the Minister of State lives although I am told his home address is in County Kildare.  He knows as well as anyone else that houses in counties Kildare, Wicklow and Meath, particularly in the areas close to Dublin, are reaching the same prices as those in parts of Dublin.  Likewise, Galway city has had a track record for decades of high house prices.  Kilkenny city is probably the same.  Under the provision of this Bill, however, the lower threshold will apply to cities such as Galway.</P>
        <P>This is unacceptable.  As a representative of County Wicklow, I resent the notion that home owners in Dublin will have preferential treatment relative to those in a county that is under similar housing pressures.  One of the solutions is simply to ensure parity across the board, which is what I propose in amendments Nos. 9 and 10.  This is not, however, the ideal solution.  My party sought to have the family home excluded and these amendments, therefore, represent second best.  However, they at least give some recognition to the fact that high house prices are not a Dublin-only phenomenon.  This type of Dublin-centred view contained in the Bill is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>There is another issue in regard to the way valuation of the family home is being used as a yardstick in terms of assessment of income.  When I first considered the Bill, I thought that if one&rsquo;s house was valued at over &euro;500,000, 5% of the excess would be assessed as income.  However, on Committee Stage, the Minister clarified matters and said that the entire valuation would be subject to the 5% levy, which is really quite daft.  If the valuation of a house is &euro;500,000 or under, it does not enter the equation, but if it is &euro;510,000, the entire value of the property is taxed, and that makes no sense whatsoever.  The margin is slight, and yet the effect is extremely significant.</P>
        <P>If the valuation were only from &euro;500,000 upwards and only that element of the house&rsquo;s value were taxed, that might be fairer.  However, at the moment there is an arbitrary cut-off point.  It is so arbitrary that, if one does not have a Dublin address, one loses out.  It used to be that Dublin 4 was a desirable address, but now it will be a Dublin address, full stop.  If one happens to have a house valued at &euro;10,000 more than that of one&rsquo;s neighbour, one may find that one&rsquo;s income is assessed in a completely different manner from that of someone with a house worth &euro;500,000 or under.</P>
        <P>Only yesterday a woman contacted me who had been trying to find a house for &euro;300,000 in north Wicklow but given up in desperation.  This is to be fixed in legislation, but where is the index-linking?  Perhaps the Minister might clarify if it is index-linked and recognises the fact that house prices are rising inexorably and that people are having ever more difficulty keeping up.  This matter has not been thought out at all.  It is arbitrary and theoretical, as if we were not dealing <Col N="1919"/>with human beings but merely with keeping costs down.  It does not recognise the reality of people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>What is the point of establishing an interdepartmental group to examine the entire issue of funding for elderly care without ensuring that the report is published and debated in full, with consultation on its findings before decisions are taken?  That does not seem to make any sense whatsoever, and it is yet another example of muddled thinking on the part of a Government that has given up making commitments to caring for the elderly in a humane manner appropriate to our status as a rich country that can afford to provide decent, high-quality care, something of which there is currently no guarantee.</P>
        <P>There is too much emphasis on the private sector, but at the same time as the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is driving her ideological carriage through the health service, she fails to provide the proper statutory framework for the inspection and regulation of nursing homes.  It is not as if most things were right in the sector, and the Government does not have a good track record.  Now it has produced a Bill that is not fair and will not deal with elderly people in an appropriate fashion.  We are expected to stay quiet, and I ask that the Minister consider what has been said to him, even at this late stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to support amendments Nos. 9 and 10 in the name of Deputy McManus in preference to No. 8 in that of Deputy Twomey.  I absolutely agree with the view that there can be no demarcation regarding property values.  The reality throughout the jurisdiction is very different from that suggested, either in the legislation as presented or in amendments Nos. 8 and 11, if taken on board.  We should insert &ldquo;or elsewhere in the State&rdquo;, since property values can be quite particular to many areas throughout the jurisdiction.  Recent years have seen the greater Dublin area expand into the south east and south of Cavan and Monaghan respectively.  If the Ceann Comhairle were here, he could confirm that, being a commuter himself.</P>
        <P>The property issue is not as straitjacketed as the legislation or certain amendments might suggest.  The deletion of (<i>b</i>)(ii) is required to give effect to the inclusive designated demarcation line for property values.  Those high prices are a consequence, I remind the Minister, of Government policy over the past nine years in particular, which has put property beyond the reach of many young couples.  This is not merely a Dublin phenomenon but one seen throughout the State.</P>
        <P>I record my support for amendments Nos. 9 and 10 for those reasons.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1920"/>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment as far as it goes, but I would also like to say something further.  I live in a second-hand council house in Straffan, County Kildare, outside the Dublin area, which is valued at approximately &euro;400,000.  If any of my neighbours had to go to St. Vincent&rsquo;s in Athy, or the excellent State facility in Maynooth, they would have to sell their house to pay for it.  Such is the effect of this measure.  I want the Minister, who is from Kildare, to explain to me how a line was drawn around Dublin with a &euro;500,000 limit.  If he goes to Leixlip, a place with which he is very familiar, for those on one side of the bridge, the limit is &euro;500,000 but for those on the other side &euro;300,000.  The penalty is quite extraordinary in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is also extraordinary that this is the only example that I can find in legislation where a means test takes into account the value of the family home.  The most stringent means test that one can have applied is that of a community welfare officer, and he does not take any account of the value of one&rsquo;s house.  The house can be worth &euro;2 million, &euro;3 million or &euro;200 million, and if one has no other income, the community welfare officer will assist one.  He will not ask one to sell one&rsquo;s house to feed oneself.  Essentially, this measure states that people in modest homes will have to sell their houses, because they are sick and old and unable to stay at home, to get into a nursing home or State long-stay facility.</P>
        <P>Universalism in many areas takes no regard of the value of homes.  In education, the sons of the wealthy can have free first, second and third level education without anyone saying that their houses should be sold to pay for their schooling.  The same is true in health, since up to the age of 65 there is no extra charge for Tony O&rsquo;Reilly, a neighbour of mine in Kildare.  If he falls ill, he goes into hospital and pays a minimal charge the same as everyone else.  Why, when people are old and unwell, at their most vulnerable, are they expected to sell their house to pay the State for care?  We do that to no one except old people who are ill, which is the only reason they are in nursing homes.</P>
        <P>Nonsense has been spoken about whether someone&rsquo;s house is worth, &euro;1 million, &euro;2 million, &euro;5 million or &euro;200 million.  The vast majority of people are not in that category but will be caught in the trap set by a Minister from County Kildare, who should know the price of houses there.  I am sure that he does, although I do not claim that the provision was his creature in the first instance.</P>
        <P>We will certainly vote against this Bill and in favour of the amendment before us, which goes some of the way towards what we would like to see.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the effect that this crazy measure will have on his own constituents in County Kildare, if on no one else.</P>

    <Title>Nuclear Test Ban Bill 2006: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>This side of the House supports this welcome Bill.  Ireland has played a fine part internationally with regard to nuclear issues, particularly at the United Nations, in maintaining a constant vigilance and presence above and beyond its numbers in terms of the size of the country.  We have been peace leaders in the world.  The Government and parties on all sides of the House have been strong and clear in their views on nuclear safety and related issues.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The issue of Sellafield, which I addressed earlier, engages us at all times.  The Government needs to internationalise the problem and bring it to the attention of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations.  In the context of nuclear issues relationships between countries like Britain and Ireland require more than government to government representation and meetings, we need an international policeman.  The United Nations, through the IAEA, should use its powers effectively and efficiently and be a guarantor of our security and safety.  It is not that we do not trust the British, but they cannot tell us what we need to know.  I understand why they may not be able to tell another sovereign government, but there is no reason they cannot be responsible to a higher body, namely, the United Nations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to bring this matter before the House.  We thank the Minister for providing the history of the treaty and its operations.  It is useful to have this information on the record.</P>
        <P>This is a timely debate.  Recent developments internationally on the development and testing of nuclear weapons by a number of countries have received much attention.  Only last week we were informed of the successful nuclear test conducted by North Korea and this morning we hear that it is to carry out further testing.  This test was a deeply distressing act that undermined security in Asia and was provocatively in clear defiance of the United Nations.  Moreover, such developments also underline the precarious position of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which Ireland was an author.</P>
        <P>It is the Labour Party&rsquo;s belief that all countries intent on developing and testing nuclear weapons should be dealt with in the context of international law.  This applies as much to Israel, India, <Col N="1922"/>and Pakistan as it does to North Korea and Iran, all of which have yet to officially declare their nuclear capability.  It is striking how little we now hear of Israel&rsquo;s nuclear capability, in contrast to the frequent media reports and justifiably frenzied fears expressed about North Korea and Iran.  In regard to the Iranian situation in particular, while the Bush Administration in the United States rhetorically tells the world it is seeking a diplomatic solution to Iran&rsquo;s nuclear threat, it is becoming increasingly evident that this may well be used as a cover for forcing regime change there.</P>
        <P>To return to North Korea, in the short term, given the small number of nuclear weapons in its possession, it is to be hoped that diplomacy rather than direct intervention can deal with this threat.  That being said, the international community through the United Nations must express its total outrage and abhorrence at the use of nuclear weapons.  Aggressive acts such as nuclear tests undermine efforts towards stability in Asia and could precipitate conflict between North Korea and its immediate neighbour to the south.  Regional security must therefore be the immediate priority, as well as ensuring the safety of the millions of people living in the area.</P>
        <P>North Korea is currently isolated from the wider regional and international community.  It is appalling that a country so desperately in need of food responds to its isolation by developing weapons for malign purposes.  Serious concerns must be expressed about the motives of the government in carrying out these tests, the regime itself, and the welfare of the North Korean people.</P>
        <P>The tests have rightly been condemned at the highest level.  The United Nations must now be given the lead role in placating the North Koreans and ensuring security in the region and throughout Asia.  The North Korean situation emphasises the need for countries such as Ireland to return to the nuclear non-proliferation discussion as a matter of urgency.  While the nuclear powers have not fulfilled their decommissioning and disarmament commitments, as was their obligation under Article 6, the treaty has been of immense significance in stopping proliferation.</P>
        <P>The nuclear suppliers group, founded in 1977, has 45 members, of which Ireland is one.  The group operates by consensus and Ireland can thus block any attempt to dilute the conditions of the NPT.  The treaty imposes disciplines to what are called the &ldquo;Full Scope Safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>India, along with Pakistan and Israel, has not signed or ratified the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, while North Korea has withdrawn from it.  These countries are therefore not subject to the full scope safeguards.  Earlier this year India offered to allow the IAEA to examine some of its nuclear installations.  While this would have placed on India a requirement similar to that <Col N="1923"/>which the nuclear powers, USA, France, Russia, UK, and China, are subject, it would not have bound India under the non-proliferation treaty.</P>
        <P>The international community cannot settle for fudges such as this.  Ireland led the way in developing and enshrining the principles of nuclear non-proliferation and we must ensure that all countries in possession of nuclear weapons are governed by the full rigours of the treaty.</P>
        <P>Turning to the legislation before us today, the Nuclear Test Ban Bill 2006 gives effect to our national obligations under the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.  The Labour Party fully endorses this legislation which will ban nuclear explosions in all environments for military or civilian purposes.  It is regrettable that given the large number of countries that are signatories to the treaty but are unlikely to follow Ireland&rsquo;s lead and enforce it nationally, it will not come into force for some time.  This is all the more regrettable considering that arms controls advocates have been advocating the need for such a global treaty since the early 1950s.  In this regard it would be most helpful if the United States, a signatory to the original treaty, moved to ratify it in Congress.  This would help to establish an international norm and would, perhaps, encourage other countries such as India, Pakistan, Iran, and North Korea to do likewise.</P>
        <P>I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to ask the Government to continually press the United States Government to ratify the treaty.  Given the current international climate, this may be unlikely, but if we are ever to make a breakthrough in containing and arresting the spread of nuclear weapons, then major powers such as the United States must respect international obligations they have already signed up to at the United Nations.</P>
        <P>Sadly, the failure of the United States to do this is typical of its attitude towards the UN and its treaties and agreements in this regard.  Perhaps it will take a much needed change of government and the removal of the current administration before this can happen.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, the issue of nuclear non-proliferation, specifically with regard to weapons of mass destruction, has gained increasing importance in recent years.  The Labour Party continues to believe that multilateral engagement rather than confrontation is the best means of addressing the spread of nuclear weapons.</P>
        <P>In considering this Bill I am struck by the fact that it is impossible to divorce nuclear weapons from the wider issue of the use of nuclear energy.  Too often the development of nuclear power and trade in uranium specifically is used as a cover for the simultaneous manufacture of nuclear weapons.  Ireland remains opposed to the nuclear option.  Nuclear power carries with it a great <Col N="1924"/>threat to the environment and public health and safety.  The day before yesterday this issue was highlighted once again, with the British Nuclear Fuel group receiving a significant fine from a local court for ongoing radiation leaks at the Sellafield reprocessing plant.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has led the way in calling for the closure of this nuclear junkyard.  I take this opportunity to repeat that call.  Sellafield continues to pose a major threat to this country, either by way of an accident at the plant, through waste being pumped into the Irish Sea, or through the threat of a terrorist attack on the plant.  It remains official Government policy to seek the closure of the plant.  I remind it of that commitment.  It should use all available opportunities to raise this issue with the British Government and to seek the closure of Sellafield once and for all.  I welcome this Bill before the House; it will have the support of the Labour Party.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this welcome proposal by the Government to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty.  I concur with the view expressed by my colleague, Deputy Stagg, in regard to Ireland&rsquo;s international policy in this general area.  In the very near future we will attend a meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group which will discuss, among other issues, the implications of the US-India agreement of July 2005.  The issue that arises is whether we will use our position on the Nuclear Suppliers Group to assert the principle of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.</P>
        <P>This treaty is perhaps best known internationally in the name of Ireland as we were one of its authors.  Finland was among the first signatories.  It is a most important treaty, and has been from its initiation in 1968.  It was reviewed in 1995 and in the year 2000, 13 steps were agreed which were to move the treaty towards universal acceptance.  The 2005 review was ineffectual and barely moved beyond the agenda.  I do not wish to dwell on this matter as I want to move on to what is centrally before us, but there are issues to be decided in regard to that treaty.</P>
        <P>At this stage, if one takes the discussion that has taken place on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is at the heart of the matter, the question is whether we take a stand and describe this as the bedrock of the Irish approach or accept other formulations such as that of Mr.<?oasys _jy ?>Baradei.  He wrote recently in a newspaper in the United States about the need to think outside the <Col N="1925"/>box and accommodate, as it were, the US-India agreement.  It is not possible to do both.  The question is whether we will stick with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and seek universality.  We have attended meetings organised by Sweden and New Zealand in seeking to bring that agenda forward but there should be a public announcement on our attitude towards the meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind the background to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  Since the first nuclear test was conducted in July 1945, more than 2,000 nuclear test explosions were conducted, most recently in North Korea.  Tests were initially conducted in the atmosphere, underwater and later underground, and mostly by the major powers, then the United States and the Soviet Union, but also France, China and the United Kingdom.  The nuclear weapons states have not conducted any nuclear tests since the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was opened for signature in September 1996.  The most recent tests prior to that of North Korea were conducted by France and China in 1996 and India and Pakistan in 1998.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt we are at a dangerous time in terms of freeing the world from the threat of nuclear contamination and destruction.  Ireland is late in ratifying this treaty.  It was opened for signature in 1996 and was signed by 71 states, including the five nuclear weapons states.  As of April 2006, the number of signatories, without obligation of ratification, had grown to 176.  A total of 132 ratifications have been made.  The difficulty is that the treaty will only enter into force 180 days after it has been ratified by 44 designated states.  The conclusion that arises is that the entire planet is held to ransom by those countries that possess nuclear capacity and refused to ratify.  That is a blunt fact.</P>
        <P>The question arises as to what one can do regarding international policy.  In terms of domestic policy, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s ratification, but significant steps should be taken in regard to the implications of international policy.  Ireland should reaffirm its commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as the bedrock of its approach and it should state explicitly that it will be guided by that principle in the resumed talks of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.  It should state also that it is in favour of a new international convention on fissile material.  In addition, it should return to the principle of universality.</P>
        <P>Models exist in regard to verification.  Like my colleague, Deputy Woods, I had the opportunity to meet spokespersons for the recent Indian proposals.  Inspection of eight of the 22 nuclear installations is not on offer as they are military &mdash; the other 14 installations are civilian.  Neither is the close scrutiny on offer in respect to members which have signed the protocols to the Nuclear <Col N="1926"/>Suppliers Group.  All this is very important.  The Chemical Weapons Convention provides a model as it has a verification regime and a set of obligations that could be used.  That model exists and we should canvass support for it.</P>
        <P>Confusion also exists in regard to international politics in respect of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and testing.  It is hard to reconcile the position currently adopted by the United States, for example, on North Korea, where it appears to advocate a regional dialogue, and in regard to Iran.  We have yet to see clear evidence of the breaches of principles of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by Iran.  A further issue relates to those non-signatory countries, not just to India but to Pakistan and Israel.</P>
        <P>It is time the lamp shone on all the countries with nuclear weapons and required of them a common obligation.  I have great difficulty with Mr. Baradei&rsquo;s inconsistent views in regard to India, on the one hand, and Iran on the other.  I note a considerable difference between his position and that of Hans Blix in the most recent report on the independent Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission.  Both share agreement on something to which I do not subscribe, the use of nuclear as a source of energy, but the difference relates to whether Mr. Baradei favours the evolution of mechanisms that are not just parallel to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty but may constitute alternatives to it.  In that sense, he is weakening the forward movement of restoring the authority of that treaty.</P>
        <P>Welcome developments are apparent.  I wish to speak positively.  It is interesting that one government after another in Latin America has decided not to go down the road of nuclear energy which gives rise to the reality of a continent that is nuclear-free.  It would be a most worthwhile objective to pursue this notion, let us say in the case of the Middle East, which is a region where the conflicts are a threat to international stability in the most general sense.  For that region to become nuclear free, it would require people to have the courage to speak about Israel&rsquo;s capacity.  I do not make the case for Iranian capacity, I simply say that if one is to address the issues of the region, one must look at the nuclear capacity in the region that is currently admitted.  We must remember that Iran is a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  The accusation has been made about non-disclosure.  One can well ask, if it had not been for Mordechai Vanunu, whether we would know about Israel&rsquo;s capacity.  What is the attitude of the international community in the sense of balance in regard to this issue?</P>
        <P>I favour the idea of regional nuclear free zones.  It is an appalling colonial legacy that the 2,000 tests since 1945 took place in the context of the abuse of the ecosystems of some of the poorest regions of the world.  France carried out tests in areas where the capacity to object was weak and <Col N="1927"/>only with courageous and innovative opposition was attention directed to them.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of this Bill is significant in that it is an acknowledgement of the importance of the rule of law internationally.  The difficulty lies in that Dr. El Baradei is speaking about bilateral alternatives to the rule of law when it is equally clear that the independent commission on weapons of mass destruction chaired by Dr. Hans Blix is stressing that our proposals and futures are best protected within the framework of international law.  We must be unequivocal in our statements in this regard, for which reason I stress the importance of achieving clarity before going to the nuclear suppliers group&rsquo;s meeting.  It is interesting that the group takes its decisions by consensus.  A single opposing member country is capable of returning the US-India agreement to the blocks.</P>
        <P>The Government was comfortable in its assumption that the American Bill would not get through the committees of the Senate or the House of Representatives.  It believed it could get away with not having a position, but the Bill has cleared both committees.  While it requires an amendment of the 1954 American legislation, the time has come to declare our hand, as uncomfortable as that may be.</P>
        <P>This is a cross-party matter and, with all respect for the Government, it should have no difficulty in declaring the Irish position, taking its departure point from the bedrock of the NPT, stressing the importance of the framework of international law, announcing that it has transposed into law the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and attempting to achieve universality in respect of the treaty.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Stagg, made an important comment.  If international policy is in difficulty and the discourse, to use an unfortunate word, has been contaminated, it is due to the bad faith of nuclear countries.  The NPT concerned the non-proliferation and eradication of nuclear weapons rather than their acceptance.  There has been an absence of good faith on the part of the nuclear powers under the Article VI provision.</P>
        <P>Many instruments and United Nations General Assembly resolutions underline the need for a comprehensive test ban.  For example, the preamble of the Partial Test Ban Treaty refers to the goal of &ldquo;seeking to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time, determined to continue negotiations to this end&rdquo;.  A key component of the deal that led to the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 was a call for the completion of negotiations on a comprehensive test ban treaty in 1996.  While the treaty was adopted by the General Assembly and opened for signature in September 1996, it has not entered into force.</P><Col N="1928"/>
        <P>Deputy Stagg stressed the importance of both urging the United States of America to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and of countries restoring the dialogue necessary to accept a general verification scheme that is impartial in its implications or obligations.  While bilateralism in international policy can resolve seemingly intractable problems, it brings dangers because the matter may descend into a dialogue between the powerful and the less powerful.</P>
        <P>The threat of force and sanctions in the Iranian case before the diplomatic possibilities were exhausted is an unwelcome development.  Ireland has not been well served by those who have spoken for the European Union in the negotiations.  We have ceded the discourse to them on the basis they might be counted upon to have the technical capacity to verify and assess threats.</P>
        <P>More significant issues must be discussed, that is, the future of the region, the EU&rsquo;s relationship with the region and global peace.  All of the options open to Mr. Ali Larijani and the representative of the Union in this respect should be evaluated carefully, such as the supply of materials, the Iranian enrichment facilities that are under international scrutiny, the time periods in which there would be full international verification and so on.  Models exist and one should not fall easily to the suggestion that one is dealing with an eternally hopeless case.  Who are the hopeless cases?  They are the ones who have not fulfilled a jot of their NPT Article VI obligations.</P>
        <P>If we are to start building block on block, the actions of the Government and Oireachtas are important in a practical sense domestically and a moral sense.  In Dr. Blix&rsquo;s recent report, he quoted former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who stated in 1956: &ldquo;If men can develop weapons that are so terrifying as to make the thought of global war almost a sentence for suicide, you would think that man&rsquo;s intelligence and his comprehension...would include also his ability to find a peaceful solution&rdquo;.  It is unwelcome that countries are not only ignoring forward movement in treaties such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the development of the 13 steps in the 2000 review of the NPT, but they are also renewing their nuclear weapons, including our nearest neighbour.  There is the possibility of putting this poisonous development into space, which is a new horizon in terms of threat and potential destruction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recently, we participated in a conference with Sweden and New Zealand to give new energy to the attempt to universalise the NPT.  We should have more such meetings, as they would be welcomed internationally.  Initiatives external to this debate can be taken.  For example, the creation of greater security in the Middle East is more than an aspiration.  The desperate need to solve the Palestinian issue would be a contribution to security.  Removing the need for security would <Col N="1929"/>remove arguments for developing nuclear capacity and putting a verification system in place would remove another.  Committing to a timescale that does not include threats can open a dialogue, which is the way to proceed.</P>
        <P>Even if one believes in none of this and seeks to achieve consistency, there cannot be a different approach to North Korea as there is to the Middle East.  It is equally important in this regard that sovereign governments which sign and ratify the treaty also accept the discipline of other existing international instruments on the control and flow of materials and the input of scientists who are involved at different stages.  I am speaking plainly about Pakistan, for example.  This is a discussion that we need to have.</P>
        <P>I do not want to single out what I have stated about the US-India agreement.  The United States has also sponsored a separate set of signings in the form of the PSI, the proliferation security initiative, which is in effect an alternative to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</P>
        <P>In diplomacy, the Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet should avoid the language, which is frequently used about some countries which are non-signatories to the discipline of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, on the suggestion that in so far as they have not signed anything, they cannot be accused of being in breach of anything.  The principles are too important for sophistry and diplomacy and international relations are tested by this issue.</P>
        <P>I welcome the all-party agreement on issues and legislation such as this.  Moderate language is most valuable and none of us is assisted by statements such as that of President Chirac, who suggested that France would not confine itself to conventional responses to threats, thereby automatically brandishing the nuclear capacity as a weapon or threat of intimidation and as a substitute for diplomacy, for which France once had a great record.</P>
        <P>Let us be positive.  We have made some progress in the elimination of the threat of war, but what we seek to achieve is a nuclear weapon-free world, with an end to testing as an important step in that direction.  We are far from that target at present.  The Government and the parties in the Opposition who are agreeing to the Bill are taking a small step.  While there are 27,000 nuclear warheads, thousands of which are on hair-trigger alert, in the world, while those with nuclear capacity are replacing their weapons, and while the intelligence of scientists is being deflected into this appalling business at the same time as world hunger, world poverty and communicable diseases could be eradicated, it is a great stain on the world.  This small step is to be welcomed and has my support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Connolly.</P>
        <P>I, like my colleagues on the Opposition side, am happy to address this issue and this timely debate, given developments in Korea, Iran and elsewhere on the issue of testing and the related issue of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  It is also appropriate that this Parliament shows a lead in this area.  We have a proud history on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in particular, in that our Government, in the person of Frank Aiken, was the first signatory in recognition of the good work we had done in promoting the issue.</P>
        <P>The Green Party would wish to support the Government in this proposed legislation but also urge it to go further and engage in real diplomatic effort with countries well disposed towards us &mdash; our near neighbours Britain and France and our neighbour the United States on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean &mdash; who need to hear a message of sanity that there is an alternative approach.  We should not spare resources or effort in that regard because we are faced with an issue of considerable import, concern and security.</P>
        <P>Having listened to Deputy Michael D. Higgins, I am drawn to recent comments by the Kerryman, John Moriarty, whom I suppose I would call a philosopher.  On some issues like this, he questions whether we are actually <i>homo sapiens</i>, whether we are able to step back and, using reason and understanding, come by agreement to an approach which saves ourselves from stepping over a brink, in this case into nuclear conflagration.  That is a matter which is at issue and of concern at present, perhaps more so now than for the past 20, 25 or 30 years.  A recent UN report states that we are on the point of the erosion of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which could become irreversible and result in a cascade in the possible proliferation of nuclear weapons.  I read that with real concern.</P>
        <P>It seems clear the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was a well struck agreement between the then nuclear powers and those countries which did not have access to nuclear weapons.  In return for the nuclear weapon-holding countries withdrawing, under Article 6, from the proliferation of those weapons and engaging in a process of dismantling the weapons, access to nuclear power would be allowed to other countries, which did not then have nuclear weapons but which, under Article 4, were given the right to use nuclear fuel for domestic power generation rather than weapons multiplication purposes.  It is clear that that deal is on the point of being broken down.</P>
        <P>First, the reaction of our friends in the United States to the reviews of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapon, particularly the 13 conditions set out in the 2000 review, can only be seen as one of a state which is not in com<Col N="1931"/>pliance, support and accord with the will existing across the board in this House on the nuclear proliferation issue.  The 2002 US nuclear posture review, which looked at their development of new additional nuclear weapons including smaller bunker bombs, clearly goes against the intent and spirit of that proliferation theory in terms of halting the development of new weapons and reducing, rather than increasing, the number of weapons.</P>
        <P>The US position in support of bringing India into the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, despite the fact that India has avowedly developed the weapons, can only be seen as putting commercial or other strategic interests ahead of the central interests in terms of whether we allow the proliferation.  That breach of faith, with the contract which is involved in that proposed deal with India, is a fundamental breach with the intent and purposes of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</P>
        <P>In its characterisation of the entire debate on those countries it calls &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; states, such as Iran and North Korea, the US has in a sense boxed itself into a corner, where the only position available is to disarm or dismantle the nuclear faclities or opt for military strikes.  It is almost impossible, as we have seen, to police effectively what is happening in a country developing nuclear power and discern whether it is going further.  Indeed, one could state that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons allows countries like North Korea to develop nuclear power to a certain extent, opt out of the treaty and then, within a short space of time as we have seen in recent weeks, announce the development of a nuclear weapons capability and engage in testing material.  The ability of Iran to abide to the letter of the law by the conditions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will not stop it developing the enrichment of materials, which would allow it also develop a nuclear facility.  The US Government&rsquo;s reaction to and position on that does not hold sway because the US itself is in breach of the 13 conditions set out by international agreement to look after its side of the bargain.</P>
        <P>What is needed here is the sort of independent force that a country like Ireland can provide in recognising the insanity and, in many instances, the injustice of what is happening.  Injustice may be the wrong word but it would be that used by an Iranian citizen, who is looking on at a world order in which our neighbour, Britain, wants to develop its nuclear capability for both commercial energy and weapons production.  It wants to develop Trident and other nuclear weapons as well as nuclear power plants while, at the same time, its representatives are telling the Iranians they cannot develop a nuclear programme for fear they will produce nuclear weapons.  An Iran<Col N="1932"/>ian would ask who are the British to say, on the one hand, Iran shall not develop weapons, while they spend billions doing just that.  Who are the British to say Iran cannot develop a nuclear industry on that basis of a fear it will produce weapons when they are developing nuclear facilities?  Calder Hall, the first British nuclear power plant, was built specifically to develop nuclear weapons and commercial energy production at that plant was a secondary thought.</P>
        <P>It is easy to envisage a world order developing where a state such as Iran will say that if it cannot have access to the West&rsquo;s nuclear energy capability, western countries will not have access to its oil supply.  We know what that would do to the price of oil and the world economy.  The current boxing off of positions, where the debate is narrowed to a battle between the axis of evil and the axis of good, is insane.  It is as clear as day to an independent neutral state such as Ireland that there is insanity and madness on both sides.  There is no justification, cause or rational explanation for Britain, which should meet its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and dismantle its weapons, to head in the opposite direction to protect a strategic role globally by deploying the latest, stronger, more destructive weapons.  That way lies madness.  The British are not being sapient in developing our future.</P>
        <P>Increasingly, a global collective approach to energy production is the only way to go for two main reasons.  Two scares have occurred in my lifetime.  I grew up in the shadow of the Cuban missile crisis when there was a rational fear in our society regarding a nuclear holocaust.  Climate change is a similar new fear.  It is almost November and the temperature is 20&deg;C.  While the current temperatures cannot be extrapolated out, I am afraid of the global heating that is taking place and of the future for my children.  The only response to that can be a global, collective, controlled, rationing system, which reduces our use of carbon to bring us to a point where we do not go below a trigger point for global temperatures, which would result in catastrophic climate change.  This is the only threat to mankind on a par with the nuclear threat.  Global multilateral co-operation is needed on climate change which, by definition, implies global co-operation on energy production because energy emissions are causing climate change.  For that reason, we need to work with countries such as Iran, and even North Korea, because it is in all our interests to formulate a global response to such change.  That cannot be done if countries are fighting with each other about whether they have nuclear power or nuclear weapons.</P>
        <P>Nuclear power is a solution to the energy crisis.  It has been estimated by David Goodstein, professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, who is an eminent physicist in this <Col N="1933"/>area, that if the use of fossil fuels were to be replaced by nuclear power, 10,000 of the largest nuclear power stations in existence would be required.  That cannot be done on the basis that they are only built in wealthy countries and that countries in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia cannot build them because this is an energy future for rich people.  Global agreement on energy production will not be reached through such a policy.  If 10,000 nuclear power stations were built, the risk of a plant producing plutonium for weapons or the risk of an accident would be too high.  In addition, the proliferation of nuclear fission material would present a danger.  Such a system needs to be dismantled and an alternative system developed.  The urgency attaching to the Manhattan project to create a nuclear weapon for the purpose of the time should attach to the creation of an alternative, renewable, energy efficient, sustainable energy approach.  That cannot happen if we are globally divided and fighting over the issue of whether different states have nuclear weapons.</P>
        <P>The peak in global oil production will occur in the next decade.  That will have major consequences and, therefore, the issue must be addressed now.  The geopolitical reality, however, is two thirds of the world&rsquo;s oil reserves are in the Middle East but Europe and America are engaged in a dispute with Iran over whether it is developing nuclear weapons.  They cannot get into a battle with such states on the nuclear issue given co-operation will be needed on oil supply.  One of the ways to resolve this difficult conundrum, given that nobody wants countries such as Iran to create nuclear weapons, is to agree proper test ban treaties, which will ensure no state develops these technologies.  That is why I welcome the Government&rsquo;s nuclear test ban.  Why will the American Government not do so?  The Americans are seeking to develop new test systems.  That way lies madness.  How can they push for the dismantling of the Iranian nuclear system or action to be taken against the North Koreans for nuclear testing when they are breaching the nuclear proliferation treaty by undertaking their own tests?  It is all very well and good to take on North Korea and Iran but the Americans, British and French need to put their house in order.  That means following the example of this House in signing a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.</P>
        <P>If Ireland is taking an independent, appropriate stance in the tradition of Frank Aiken on foreign policy, it behoves us to apply it to other aspects of our domestic policy and that includes appropriate monitoring of what is happening in our airports, where we can have control over the use or development of weapons.  If states say they must use Shannon Airport for certain purposes, that is fine but there is no reason we should fail to check such flights to establish the cargo and the military <Col N="1934"/>purpose.  Ireland needs to be strong on that and on an international scheme.  We should ask other states to stop this madness before it goes too far.  There is no reason, as Deputy Michael D. Higgins stated, for having 20,000 nuclear weapons operable and ready to go on the planet and there is every reason to reverse the proliferation of such weapons, which would result in resources being deployed in areas they are needed.</P>
        <P>The UK is investing in a new Trident nuclear weapons system using its military budget, which is approximately Stg&pound;48 billion.  It is running out of oil and gas but it has been spending money on the military like kings.  Such funding will not be available in another 20 years.  Where will it obtain the money for its defence budget?  British officials would be wiser spending the money they have set aside for nuclear weapons on organising its housing stock for the new energy future and on international negotiations to persuade the Americans, French and others that their supposed security system and Security Council are not secure because they do not work.  It leaves us all exposed to the possibility of a rogue state or a rogue terrorist in this climate of distrust, double standards and saying one thing while doing another using a nuclear weapon.  We will then be in a difficult position.  It is not too late to reverse this and begin a sensible strategy.  The Bill is one small step in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, which has been a considerable period in gestation, and its transposition into law.  It is timely in view of the events of the past couple of weeks.</P>
        <P>Multilateral treaties cannot in themselves ensure security but they offer a framework to meet today&rsquo;s extremely serious challenges.  These range from the risks of accidental nuclear war and terrorist use of a nuclear device to global warming and the massacre of citizens.  Multilateral treaties and the regimes they establish contribute to national and global security by articulating norms, creating monitoring and enforcement mechanisms and providing benchmarks for progress.</P>
        <P>Opponents of international treaties caution against binding agreements which other states may not obey, but legal systems must not be abandoned because some parties do not comply.  Instead, violations must be addressed with enforcement mechanisms, including verification procedures that work to detect and deter violations and a range of sanctions.</P>
        <P>The principal question raised by recent events has been what the United Nations can do to ensure compliance by North Korea.  On the part of the United States, the events of 11 September 2001 spawned a revised foreign policy from that of the previous Clinton Administration.  President Bush singled out states suspected of backing terrorists and developing and proliferating weapons <Col N="1935"/>of mass destruction.  He referred to North Korea, Iran and Iraq as states which, with their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, aiming to threaten the peace of the world.  Following 9/11, North Korea was reportedly included, with Russia, China, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya, as a target for the use of nuclear weapons.</P>
        <P>Despite being a party to nuclear non-proliferation treaties, North Korea admitted it had been acquiring the capacity to build a plant for producing highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.  It was unclear whether North Korea had actually built such a plant and, if so, whether it produced any highly enriched uranium as the IAEA monitors were ordered to dismantle their inspection equipment and leave the country.  Having unsealed its irradiated fuel storage and ejected the IAEA inspectors, North Korea put itself in a position to resume a nuclear weapons program without international safeguards.</P>
        <P>At that time North Korea stressed it had no intention to produce nuclear weapons and that its nuclear activities would be confined only to peaceful purposes such as the production of electricity.  The House should note the production of electricity is often used as a cover when parties have ulterior motives.  North Korea&rsquo;s actions violated the provision of the agreed framework under which it agreed to work consistently for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.  However, it may have been lost sight of that all nuclear weapon states made a commitment to eventual disarmament and agreed to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control.  The states committed to a statement of principles and objectives that included systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons.  In 1996 the International Court of Justice ruled that the use of nuclear weapons was generally illegal and that all nuclear weapons states were required to pursue and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects.</P>
        <P>The true motives behind North Korea&rsquo;s recent activities are a matter of conjecture and the rest of the world must decide upon a policy in that context.  However, one must also take into account the open intent of the United States to continue to wield nuclear weapons and threaten their use.  The US insistence that others must fully adhere to their treaty commitments is therefore not very persuasive and undermines the credibility of US demands for compliance.  Only in symmetry of compliance is there any hope for maintaining the strength of the non-proliferation treaty, which is considered crucial in preventing more states from choosing the nuclear option and further jeopardising global security.  In this <Col N="1936"/>regard, the United States should commit to irreversible reductions of nuclear weapon stockpiles and affirm its commitment to a test ban.</P>
        <P>The profile of some of the individuals who have their fingers on the buttons is frightening.  North Korea, for example, is headed by a somewhat eccentric man, Kim Jong-Il, a diminutive playboy at odds with his brutal regime, and a vain, paranoid hypochondriac who wears platform shoes to enhance his height of 5&rsquo; 3&rdquo;.   It is unclear whether he is a master manipulator or an irrational madman &mdash; I suggest the latter.  He is said to have a library of 20,000 Hollywood films and to have engineered the kidnapping in 1978 of a South Korean film director and his girlfriend.  His views of the world are probably shaped by many of the films he watches.  He has been linked by defectors to the 1986 bombing of a Korean Airlines jet in which 115 people were killed.  He is also seen as a clever manipulator, willing to take great risks to underpin his regime, such as his recent decision to test a nuclear device.  Regrettably, Kim Jong-Il is not alone in the world, as is demonstrated by the actions of the Iranian President Ahmadinejad and others who have fingers poised over nuclear buttons.</P>
        <P>The nuclear processing plant at Sellafield, on our doorstep, would be an obvious target for terrorists.  The consequences this plant could have for most of Ireland if a nuclear accident were to occur or if it were to be attacked by terrorists have been highlighted.  An explosion and fire would be just the beginning as the cooling system and tanks would heat up and spew out more radioactivity within hours.  As much as half of the caesium-137 in the tanks could escape into the air, and would amount to 44 times more caesium-137 than was released by the Chernobyl disaster.  We are all familiar with the consequences of that disaster and its legacy for many children.  The resulting 4 million terabecquerels of radioactivity would contaminate most of Britain and, depending on which way the wind was blowing, Ireland, continental Europe and beyond.  Large parts of Britain and Ireland would become uninhabitable and, as they are more densely populated than the Ukraine, widespread chaos would ensue.  In the following 50 years it is estimated 2 million cancers would be caused, assuming the pattern of public exposure was similar to that at Chernobyl.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to voluntary groups in Monaghan who take groups of children from Chernobyl to Ireland for holidays, which is a nice gesture and one that should be noted.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty would provide a unique opportunity to contain the growing threat of nuclear proliferation.  Since 1996 over 158 nations, including the US, have signed the nuclear test ban treaty, yet the world has witnessed nuclear and missile tests in India, Pakistan, Iran and North Korea.  Global enact<Col N="1937"/>ment of the nuclear test ban treaty banning all nuclear test explosions can provide a last line of defence against new advances in weapons development.  Nations can build unsophisticated nuclear weapons without testing but they would be much less likely to do so knowing they could not test.  Without a ban on testing, other weapons states will at some point begin testing again.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>At the end of the Cold War, the ability of two aging superpowers to control their neighbours&rsquo; nuclear destinies had weakened.  Given that there are 27,000 nuclear warheads in the world, one wonders how stable are the minds of those with their fingers on the nuclear buttons.  If we knew the full facts we might not sleep at night, but that is how the world has become.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The case for a nuclear test ban is overwhelming.  It would make the single most important contribution to world peace.  I support the Bill.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods"><NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the Bill.  It is substantial and I congratulate the Minister, his officials and the Parliamentary Counsel on the work done in this regard.  It is important legislation.  </P>
        <P>The Bill is fully in keeping with the country&rsquo;s proud tradition of opposition to the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and of support for nuclear disarmament going back to the original proposal in 1958 at the United Nations by Mr. Frank Aiken when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  That led to the coming into existence a number of years later of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT.  Ireland had the distinction of being the first signatory of the treaty in recognition of our initiative at that time.  We were invited to be among the first signatories because the idea for it had come from Ireland.</P>
        <P>Throughout the decades of the Cold War and the period since, the NPT, while not without its weaknesses, has stood as a beacon of hope for the international community in a world where the nuclear weapons threat has been a major danger to world peace.  The NPT, however, accepts the possession of nuclear weapons by the five major powers which are permanent members of the UN Security Council.  It is also generally accepted that there are a number of countries outside the NPT which have developed nuclear weapons.  Besides these, the IAEA has stated that outside the NPT, India and Pakistan hold nuclear weapons and Israel is believed to be nuclear weapons capable.  The DPRK in North Korea has just carried out an underground weapons test.</P>
        <P>It is against this background that the issue of nuclear weapons testing comes into focus and that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was negotiated and agreed in September 1996.  The treaty resulted from recognition of the need for continued efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally with the ultimate aim of eliminating them and bringing about clear disarmament <Col N="1938"/>under strict and effective international control.  As a key step in this direction, it is foreseen that the cessation of all nuclear weapons tests by constraining the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and ending the development of new types of nuclear weapons would constitute an effective measure of nuclear disarmament and proliferation, in other words, a complete and comprehensive test ban.</P>
        <P>It was considered that the most effective way to achieve an end to nuclear testing was through the conclusion of a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, which has long been one of the highest priority objectives of the international community in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation.  The purpose of the Bill before the House is to give effect, as far as Ireland is concerned, to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</P>
        <P>The main thrust of the basic obligations imposed upon the parties to the treaty is that they undertake not to carry out any nuclear weapons test, to prohibit any such test being carried out at any place under their jurisdiction and to refrain from causing, encouraging or in any way participating in the carrying out of any nuclear weapons test.  The Bill creates as offences any actions contrary to the State&rsquo;s obligations under the treaty and puts in place a system of inspections designed to bring to light any such actions or suspected actions.  The rights and responsibilities of members of inspection teams, observers and authorised officers are set out in detail in the Bill.  In this regard, there appears to be some lack of clarity as to the distinction between persons referred to as international inspectors and those referred to as authorised officers.  Perhaps the Minister will consider amending the Bill to make this distinction clearer.</P>
        <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is designated in the Bill as the national authority for the purpose of the Act and the treaty.  This is entirely appropriate.  I take this opportunity to commend the institute on the excellent work it has done since its establishment in 1992 in activities as diverse as advising the Government on hazards for Ireland from the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant and other nuclear establishments abroad, regulating effectively the ever more sophisticated applications of ionising radiation in medicine and industry, and assessing and bringing to public attention the hazards to public health arising from elevated levels of radon gas in buildings.</P>
        <P>The institute has developed a high level of sophistication and professionalism and is one on which we all rely.  It is important that this excellent work is sustained into the future to ensure the continued protection of the Irish people against the hazards of ionising radiation in the many forms in which it arises.  This need is inten<Col N="1939"/>sified by the likelihood that the UK is about to embark on a major programme of construction of new nuclear power plants.</P>
        <P>The nuclear issue has been a major cause of contention in relations between the UK and Ireland for many years, centring principally on discharges of radioactive waste from Sellafield into the Irish Sea.  This has been a matter of great concern to all of us on the east coast, particularly those who live close to the sea.  We are not happy about the situation, notwithstanding the fact that there is constant regulation, management, control and testing by the RPII.  The levels are regarded as being of very low incidence and they are checked regularly.  Notwithstanding that, it is an uneasy situation.</P>
        <P>We are concerned about the health of our children in particular and of our people generally and the risk of serious consequences for this country from a major accident or terrorist attack at the Sellafield plant.  There are two issues in this regard, one is the major one of such an attack and the other is the continuous discharges of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea, even though they are at a low level.  What will happen when the number of nuclear plants in the United Kingdom is increased, especially if reprocessing is to be done at Sellafield or in that area?</P>
        <P>In 2001 the Government, having taken detailed legal advice, instituted legal proceedings against the UK in regard to a number of issues surrounding Sellafield.  While these proceedings have not yet reached their final conclusion, interim judgments have required the UK to make information about its nuclear activities available to the Irish Government to a degree far beyond anything that had occurred previously.  While we would like to achieve much more from these legal proceedings, this has been a beneficial outcome of them.  I understand it has enabled Irish officials and RPII experts to make very informed representations to the UK authorities on issues of nuclear technology and preparedness for emergencies.  This has also been accompanied by an improved spirit of co-operation on the UK side.</P>
        <P>Another key issue relating to Sellafield arises from the proposed new expansion of nuclear power in the UK.  There is a danger that the expansion programme would give a new lease of life to nuclear fuel reprocessing at Sellafield and so delay perhaps by several decades the day when Sellafield would finally begin to be phased out and decommissioned.  This would be a most undesirable turn of events from an Irish point of view and would almost certainly result in the discharge of more contaminated effluent into the Irish Sea.</P>
        <P>The Minister has rightly made strong representations to the British Government that it should not proceed with plans to build new nuclear power plants.  We must, however, recognise that <Col N="1940"/>the United Kingdom may still decide to do so.  If it does, it will have to decide how to deal with the spent nuclear fuel from the new plants.  The fuel can be sent for reprocessing at Sellafield or kept in so-called &ldquo;dry storage&rdquo;, pending ultimate disposal.  This, I understand, is quite a finely balanced choice from the users&rsquo; point of view.  From an Irish point of view, however, it makes an immense difference.  Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister to expand his representations to the United Kingdom to the effect that should it decide to go ahead with the construction of new nuclear power plants, it should opt for the dry storage approach rather than the reprocessing route for the management of the spent fuel from such plants.  That, ultimately, is the crucial issue for those of us living close to the Irish Sea.  Such a representation would have a real chance of success and could mark a substantial step towards the eventual closure of Sellafield.</P>
        <P>Sellafield and the nuclear industry apart, it is important to maintain the protection of the public against other hazards associated with ionising radiation.  Such radiation plays a vital role in medical and some industrial settings.  In certain cases, it is at such intensities that error or mishap could result in serious danger to patients, staff or members of the public.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is the regulatory body with responsibility for ensuring that the highest safety standards are observed during all usage of radiation.  It can take credit for the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s safety record in this area is extremely good.  However, there can never be room for complacency in matters of safety and the RPII must always have sufficient resources to ensure that this safety record is maintained.</P>
        <P>Another hazard is the risk of lung cancer resulting from exposure to elevated levels of radon gas in buildings.  This gas emanates from the natural radioactive decay of trace quantities of uranium in the underlying rock strata and in some cases can reach dangerous concentrations in individual buildings.  This was tragically illustrated a number of years ago by a case in Kerry of a couple in their forties, non-smokers, who both died of lung cancer.  Their house was found to have a concentration of radon almost 250 times the recommended maximum level.  It is estimated that up to 200 lung cancer deaths in Ireland each year are attributable to radon.</P>
        <P>Much has been done to address the radon hazard.  The RPII conducted a nationwide survey which quantified the problem and highlighted the areas of the country at highest risk.  Since 1997, the Government has had all primary and secondary schools tested for radon, with remedial measures carried out where necessary.  Building regulations introduced in 1998 require that all new houses built since then have radon preventive measures incorporated during construction.  Awareness of the problem is growing but must <Col N="1941"/>increase further so that householders have their houses tested for radon and, where necessary, implement remedial measures.  The RPII has estimated that approximately 90,000 dwellings in the country have high radon levels.  It is very important that such dwellings are identified and made safe.  It is also important that householders open windows regularly to let the air circulate.  It is crucial that the radon tests are extended to all houses that are at risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of our discussions on these issues, I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the fact that yesterday I, with other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, including Deputies Michael D. Higgins, Carey, Mulcahy and Allen, met Mr. Shyam Saran, the Special Envoy of the Indian Prime Minister on nuclear issues.  Mr. Saran was in Ireland to brief the Government on India&rsquo;s policies in the nuclear area.  Members of the joint committee had a most informative meeting with him, in which he outlined to us India&rsquo;s position on a range of nuclear related issues.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will meet the joint committee next week.  This is an issue which the committee takes very seriously.</P>
        <P>In particular, Mr. Saran set out the background to, and a detailed account of, the proposed strategic partnership between India and the United States of America in the area of civil nuclear co-operation, which was agreed during President Bush&rsquo;s visit to India in July 2005.  Mr. Saran told us that the Indian Government sees this partnership largely in the context of its growing energy needs, as the country&rsquo;s economy expands rapidly.  If the proposed partnership goes ahead &mdash; it has not yet been approved by the US Senate &mdash; India would allow 14 of its 22 nuclear reactors to be opened for inspection under safeguard agreements with the IAEA.  However, this would leave eight of India&rsquo;s nuclear installations outside the purview of the IAEA.</P>
        <P>Although India is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has always taken a responsible attitude to its nuclear capabilities.  Ireland, on the other hand, is a strong defender of the NPT and the safeguard regimes of the IAEA and, therefore, has a different perspective from that of India in this area.  I and other members of the committee were able to outline Ireland&rsquo;s views and concerns in this regard to Mr. Saran.  The meeting was very useful as we were given a comprehensive and informative statement of India&rsquo;s position.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on this major and highly valuable legislation, which I am sure will have the full support of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this legislation, which will belatedly bring us to the point where we are signatories to the treaty.  This is our way of contributing.  I know <Col N="1942"/>that we are not a nuclear power, nor should we ever be one.  Some have argued that we should have a debate on nuclear energy but as a spokesperson in the energy and communications area, I believe that since we are not going to become a nuclear-based power, we should not waste our energy on such a debate.  There are only so many ways to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  What part of &ldquo;No&rdquo; can people not understand?  Our energy requirements should never be dependent on nuclear energy for a number of reasons.  First, there was a serious accident in Chernobyl.  Many people have concerns about those nuclear installations which are close to this country and potential damage from them.  The Chernobyl accident was far away and its effects took two weeks to get here but they arrived with no difficulty at all.  There is a lesson to be learned, which is that we do not require that source of energy.</P>
        <P>We must develop other sources.  We have the time and impetus to do so, and now is the time to act.  We have a responsibility to replace imported fuel and energy with a source that is indigenous.  That will occupy our minds for some time, but it will be well worthwhile.  It is happening slowly.  In the end it will be positive, constructive and important.</P>
        <P>Before I move on to the Bill proper, I note much has been said on the energy requirements throughout Europe and the European energy grid.  Very little has been said on the degree to which this relies on nuclear energy.  There is significant reliance in France and the Scandinavian countries, and the UK will become more reliant on it.  Some countries are advantageously positioned as their terrain may have large valleys, and they can generate a great deal of electricity from hydroelectric power without displacing large populations.</P>
        <P>There are two aspects in speaking about nuclear power and energy, the development of nuclear technology for military use and war purposes, and the development purely for energy purposes.  The debate has centred around the countries which are or are not signatories to the test-ban treaty.  Those which are not controlled or within that loop clearly create a greater degree of volatility with regard to how nuclear energy is handled worldwide.  If these countries are not party to an agreement or within a particular group of people with a convergence of thought on how energy should be developed, they are clearly open to persuasion by others.  They are open to whoever is the highest bidder.  We should be aware that science is advancing rapidly.  Nuclear weapons and energy is generally coming within the grasp of people with plenty of money.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Carey, was waving and I thought he was either swatting flies or waving at me.  Clearly he was doing neither, despite Kerrymen having been known to do peculiar things from time to time.</P><Col N="1943"/>
        <P>The major powers have had access to nuclear energy for a long time, not that we have always agreed with it.  We recognise that in many cases these countries have put nuclear energy to good use, such as for domestic purposes and so on.  When we move away from these countries, there are other nations and people who can gain access to nuclear technology.  Many of these nations have no reason for control, and they may have reasons for doing the exact opposite.  They often have a grudge.  Nevertheless, these countries have access to science and financial resources.  They have many reasons, all justifiable on one side or the other, as to why they should have access to nuclear weapons and why they should be allowed to develop them.</P>
        <P>Much was said earlier on the comparisons being made between the US reaction to North Korea and its reaction to Iran.  I cannot personally understand how sanctions are going to stop the development of nuclear weapons in North Korea.  It may slow down the economic development of some of the people further down the social strata but it will not in any way inhibit the development of nuclear weapons if that is the road the North Koreans will go.</P>
        <P>This debate has taken place in this House and other houses over the years.  We can go back as far as the sanctions which were implemented against South Africa and Rhodesia.  I still do not know how those sanctions impacted negatively on the people against whom they were targeted.  For example, to this day in South Africa it remains to be seen if such sanctions were effective at all.  I do not believe they were, rather that they severely impacted on people within that country who were already poor, deprived and impoverished.  What will happen in North Korea will remain to be seen.  The difference between that case and Iran is that the latter is a very powerful country in terms of population.  It has a huge population of perhaps 60 million or 80 million people and has many natural resources, including massive oil reserves.  It is potentially very wealthy.  There is a difference between the North Korean case and Iran.  I do not know whether sanctions or negotiation are likely to come about there.</P>
        <P>I am not proposing for a moment that military strikes will solve the problem.  Negotiation of some type is required at this stage, and that is the feeling of most people watching these developments over the past number of years.  If military strikes come about there will be retaliation of some nature somewhere.  Sanctions, on the other hand, have been implemented against Cuba by the US and that has done nothing to achieve a meeting of minds between the two countries.  It has made people who are already poor much poorer, but that is as far as it has gone.  The point we must examine now and in future, with regard to the two countries concerned, is <Col N="1944"/>whether the procedures now proposed to be followed are likely to have anything other than a negative effect.  In those circumstances we may be far better off to enter negotiations.  It can do no harm to do so right until the last possible moment.</P>
        <P>Other speakers have referred to the numbers which already have access to nuclear energy and, ultimately, nuclear weapons through enrichment procedures.  There may be some countries involved in this that we do not know about.  It is now possible, with modern developments in the science area, to develop miniature nuclear bombs, for example.  That is possible, and they may be in the marketplace already.  We do not know.</P>
        <P>Knowledge of what is happening is very important.  We did not know the facts about the Chernobyl accident for perhaps two weeks after the event.  If the authorities at Chernobyl had announced to the world what was happening in time, it may have been possible to avert the accident.  There are some in this country, and even this House, who may promote the idea of nuclear energy for domestic purposes.  I have read some accounts recently that the Chernobyl accident should not have happened.  We know it should not have happened, but it did.  In promotion of their theory, these people argue that science has moved on and that it is now possible to have safe nuclear energy.  It is possible to have nuclear energy that is safer than it was, but this is not necessarily safe.  The two ideas are very clearly different.</P>
        <P>Without a doubt nuclear power is a simple method of getting access to huge amounts of continuous energy for the reasonably mid-term future.  Having said that, we must question whether our knowledge and ability to control situations are satisfactory and that, at the moment, is not remotely the case.  Somebody will say we already have access to nuclear-generated electricity through interconnectors but I know that.  That will remain the case into the future but we will hopefully have access to outgoing interconnectors so that we can export some of our energy, which is not nuclear-generated, and make a contribution to the international grid based on renewables, which will be better.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s access to nuclear energy through the backdoor is the original Irish solution to an Irish problem.  It could only happen here.  One Minister, not very long ago, discussed the possibility of divining nuclear energy from other electricity generation.  How he proposed to do that I do not know.  Ministers and future Ministers have colossal potential but it has not yet become clear how the Minister in question intended to select nuclear-generated electricity and despatch it elsewhere while drawing only on the organically generated electricity for which he obviously had a <Col N="1945"/>preference.  It is a nice thought but doubtful in practical terms.</P>
        <P>On the subject of maintenance, I am not keen for a nuclear reactor to be constructed in this country at this time.  After all, if we cannot build a tunnel that can keep water out or a swimming pool that can keep water in, I find it difficult to understand how we could build a nuclear reactor safe from the threat of explosions, leakage and contamination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, Hear.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given our history with tunnels and the costs of various projects, I suggest the Minister stays well away from that proposal for some time.</P>
        <P>Sellafield has also been mentioned.  As it is located so close to our shores we need to comment on it.  The highest possible standards must apply to all nuclear facilities.  In a typically Irish fashion we export our nuclear waste to Sellafield to be reprocessed.  One accident is all that is needed and there have already been a number, not only at Sellafield but at various nuclear plants throughout the world; we have already referred to one of especial significance.</P>
        <P>Murphy&rsquo;s law states that if something can happen, it will.  Human nature being what it is, the smallest incident can trigger a big accident.  It behoves us to bear in mind that that possibility remains, even though we do not have nuclear power on our own shore.  As a result of our proximity to the UK, Sellafield has been a bone of contention for a long time and will remain so.  Our colleagues across the water understand our concerns about it.</P>
        <P>I will finish by referring to an area covered by my portfolio, namely energy requirements and the debate for which some have called.  I have no objection to a debate taking place but I read in a newspaper not long ago that nuclear energy was quite safe and that Chernobyl, in scale, was not too important.  It asserted that people did not die in great numbers.  I was amazed that pen could be put to paper to produce what was nothing more than propaganda.  It was a serious accident and will have serious implications for a long time for the people who lived there and will not be able to do so again.  It is not true to say nobody lost his or her life or that people&rsquo;s quality of life was not affected.  That the accident happened and was serious are facts.  Neither is it true to say no resources were available to control it because substantial resources were put into attempting to control the reactor when the accident happened.  However, they were not sufficient, despite people&rsquo;s best efforts.  Some in this House and outside will say that if the authorities had been better organised nothing would have happened but we do not know that.  The authorities were at the <Col N="1946"/>scene at the time and did their best, but it was not good enough.</P>
        <P>I do not know how important the treaty will be.  That will depend on the degree to and the spirit in which it is observed, not only by the signatories but by those are are not.  If there are some who have no intention of restricting their development of nuclear energy for military purposes, or who have no intention of subscribing to any international convention to curb that activity, then we must ask who will police them and how effectively they can do it.  I say this with a simple knowledge of nuclear power and weapons and the nuclear industry in general, and against a background in which substantial sections of Europe rely for their energy requirements on nuclear energy.  Much of that is well policed, or at least so it is claimed, but I was forced to smile a few years ago when an EU member state objected to an incoming country on the grounds that its nuclear technology was not up to scratch.  As Deputy Carey will recall, the incoming country responded that it used the same technology, of the same vintage, as the member state.  We all tend to look over the garden wall and criticise those on the other side when it might serve us better to take note of what actually happens.</P>
        <P>The treaty will hopefully be of some benefit.  That will be the case if its signatories observe it and if those who are not signatories recognise that, with the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the whole area becomes less and less controllable.  The less control there is the greater the potential for accidents or attacks, unprovoked or otherwise.  In such circumstances we must ask ourselves the simple question: &ldquo;Will it work?&rdquo;</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very important opportunity to reflect on the debate about nuclear energy and power, and the differentiation, to which Deputy Durkan referred, between the use of nuclear energy for civil and commercial purposes and for military purposes.  It is difficult to separate the two.</P>
        <P>A global halt to nuclear weapons, as well as test explosions, has been a key security objective of the international community since the early 1950s.  In the 1990s, spurred by a new round of Cold War nuclear testing moratoria and civil society support, multilateral negotiations on a test ban treaty were finally officially opened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ten years ago last month, UN member states overwhelmingly endorsed and later opened for signature the longest sought, hardest fought nuclear arms control treaty, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, CNTBT.  Today, despite widespread support for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and a <i>de facto</i> global nuclear test moratorium, the treaty has not entered into force.  We cannot let the opportunity pass to comment on the broad geopolitical situation.  Independent monitors have established <Col N="1947"/>that a nuclear bomb was detonated underground in North Korea because there are traces of radiation suspended in the atmosphere.</P>
        <P>We must also consider the reaction to that unfortunate event.  North Korea is a partner in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, NPT, process but that did not stop it from detonating this explosion.  It is interesting that China, rightly, condemned this exercise and influenced North Korea to moderate its actions.  China also supported the UN motion to introduce sanctions against North Korea and Russia became involved.  I share Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s reservations about the trade sanctions.  The country which will hold the most influence, oddly, is Japan because it has a significant trade in luxury goods with North Korea.  The roles of Seoul and Beijing are critical too.</P>
        <P>We should not dismiss the latest UN Chapter 7 motion which is important for the international community.  I would not, however, hold my breath waiting to see its effectiveness but it teaches us a lesson about the emerging balance of power in that region where China is taking a responsible role in foreign policy.  We can look forward to further initiatives from that quarter.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Woods said, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs met a representative of the Indian Prime Minister specialising in the nuclear industry.  He explained India&rsquo;s position on its partnership with the United States.  I would be much more worried about this partnership than about North Korea.  The US Senate has yet to ratify the strategic partnership with India and that is unlikely to happen before the mid-term elections.  Whether it will happen in 2007 remains to be seen.</P>
        <P>It might appear that there is nothing to be afraid of in that one of two neighbouring nuclear states, India and Pakistan, is in partnership with the United States for ostensibly sound commercial and economic reasons.  There is, however, a danger if we depart from the accepted norms in respect of working outside the NPT, that Egypt, Saudi Arabia or other countries in that region might do the same.  At the recent meeting of the nuclear suppliers group, Ireland took a strong stand against the ratification of this partnership.</P>
        <P>The United States and the European Union are rightly exerting pressure on the parties in Iran to suspend further development of the nuclear industry there.  We cannot ignore the fact that the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would not be <i>ad idem</i> on how the role of Iran might develop in the next few years, bearing in mind the influential actors surrounding them, Afghanistan is significantly under the US control, Israel has a significant nuclear arsenal, Iraq is in serious danger of fracturing and within Iran and Iraq the Kurdish community is likely to push for greater indepen<Col N="1948"/>dence.  Political or economic discussions may ensure greater progress in Iran than the remote threat of the exercise of the military option against the leadership in Iran. I concur with other speakers that only as an absolutely last resort should we countenance anything remotely resembling what happened to Iraq happening to Iran.</P>
        <P>Other speakers mentioned Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Windscale, as Sellafield was formerly known.  No matter what gloss is put on them, nuclear reactors are dangerous.  They constitute serious risks to global security.  Anybody who has met the children who come here on holiday from Chernobyl needs little convincing to agree with those who are emphatically against the proliferation of nuclear power.  It is difficult to counter the argument that we will be using nuclear power here regardless of whether we like it.  It will not be possible to run nuclear generated electricity down one type of cable and hydroelectricity down another, much as we like to think it will be possible.  Nonetheless it is important to debate the issue.  Earlier in this parliamentary session Dieter Helm, energy adviser to the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, told us that as far as he could establish the nuclear energy debate in Ireland is dead and buried because we do not have the capacity to allow for a modest sized nuclear reactor.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We like talking about it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>From that point of view we can have the luxury of condemning those who promote nuclear power and avoid taking the hard decisions.</P>
        <P>It took 50 years to agree the nuclear test ban treaty which is a simple treaty with profound value for the struggle against proliferation.  By prohibiting any nuclear weapons test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, the treaty would simultaneously help constrain the qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons, curb proliferation, advance disarmament and delegitimise nuclear weapons.  The comprehensive test ban treaty has been signed by 176 states and 135 states have ratified it.  The Bill before the House will give effect to the treaty under Irish law, completing our ratification.  While the international community easily ratifies treaties, it often then does nothing to enforce them.  No country has a monopoly on morality regarding any of those treaties.</P>
        <P>Of the 44 states identified in the treaty&rsquo;s annex II, whose ratifications are required for the treaty to enter into force, 34 have done so.  Nevertheless, ten years after its opening for signature, the treaty is still in a vulnerable position.  Ten key states, including India, Pakistan and the United States, must sign and ratify it to enable the accord to take full legal effect.  As each year passes without the treaty entering into force, the odds <Col N="1949"/>increase that one state or another will resume ongoing nuclear testing.  This debate is an important opportunity to reaffirm our support for the full implementation of the treaty and address the challenges facing it.</P>
        <P>It is important to consider the purpose of the comprehensive test ban treaty, the challenges to its entry into force and the consequences for national and international security if nuclear testing were to be resumed.  A nuclear test ban contributes to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology, as well as supporting disarmament.  It prevents further damage to the environment from the intense heat and radiation of successive nuclear blasts.  I recently read that there were still adverse radiation effects on the environment after some underground tests carried out by the United States.  The comprehensive test ban treaty&rsquo;s contribution to curbing the development of new types of nuclear warheads also helps to reduce dangerous nuclear arms competition between the existing nuclear capable states.</P>
        <P>While treaty signature and ratification by the 44 key states may not close off their nuclear capabilities, it would rule out further development and operational deployment of new weapons that would help dampen destabilising arms races in many regions.  One concern over Israel having an arsenal of nuclear weapons is that if there were ever a temptation to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East, it would be difficult for Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria not to be tempted to follow the same route.  The international community, therefore, must be resolute in enforcing the test ban treaty.</P>
        <P>The comprehensive test ban treaty&rsquo;s far-reaching nuclear test monitoring provisions, including an international monitoring network and short notice on-site inspections, would ensure other countries are not conducting nuclear test explosions.  The full-scale implementation of this system depends on entry into force of the treaty.  It is possible that financial support for the establishment of the treaty&rsquo;s monitoring and verification system will wane if entry into force is indefinitely delayed.  In return for economic support, some countries, such as India and Iran, may be more transparent in allowing inspections.  Mr. Mohamed El Baradei and Mr. Hans Blix have pointed out the fine line between willingness and resistance to co-operate with nuclear inspections.  Politics being the art of the possible, I suggest more diplomacy be deployed.</P>
        <P>Entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty would also prevent additional environmental and health damage from nuclear test explosions and reduce the risk of nuclear war.  Between 1945 and 2000, seven countries conducted 2,046 nuclear test explosions, an average of one test every ten days.  That is a chilling reminder.  To borrow a phrase, &ldquo;they haven&rsquo;t <Col N="1950"/>gone away, you know&rdquo;.  By 2000, the 528 atmospheric tests delivered radioactive materials that will have produced approximately 430,000 additional cancer fatalities, according to a 1990 report by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.  The US National Cancer Institute has estimated that the 90 dirtiest US nuclear tests will cause 10,000 to 75,000 additional thyroid cancers.</P>
        <P>While underground nuclear blasts pose a much smaller radioactive hazard than atmospheric tests, there has been widespread venting from underground explosions.  The US has acknowledged that 114 of its 723 underground tests have released radioactive material into the atmosphere.</P>
        <P>The atomic bombings of 6 and 9 August 1945 illustrate the magnitude of harm caused by nuclear explosions.  Of Hiroshima&rsquo;s population of 340,000 people, 130,000 were dead by November 1945 and by 1950 an additional 70,000 had perished, mainly from radiation-related illnesses.  In Nagasaki, 70,000 people were killed outright or died within the first four months and another 70,000 died by 1950.</P>
        <P>The test ban treaty does not stand or fall by itself.  Rather, it is a vital part of a network of treaties, agreements and norms that underpin international efforts to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction and codify multilateral arms control and disarmament.  Repudiating or weakening one or more elements erodes the overall framework.</P>
        <P>The comprehensive test ban treaty is an essential step toward restoring confidence in the beleaguered nuclear non-proliferation treaty regime, the cornerstone for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament.  The preamble of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty refers to the determination to seek to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time.  The nuclear-weapon states&rsquo; commitment to achieve the comprehensive test ban treaty was a crucial part of the bargain that won the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1995.  Ireland continues to regard these as the benchmarks for nuclear disarmament.  It is important to recall the influential role played by Ireland in the early days of the debate on nuclear non-proliferation.  The then Minister for External Affairs, the late Mr. Frank Aiken, played a critical role in formulating the non-proliferation treaty.</P>
        <P>While widespread repudiation of the NPT is not likely in the immediate future, the regime is vulnerable.  Rejection of the comprehensive test ban treaty by some states may provide an excuse for a government that wished to renounce or thwart its NPT obligations.  For example, inaction on the comprehensive test ban treaty by the United States has already complicated efforts to strengthen the International Atomic Energy <Col N="1951"/>Agency&rsquo;s safeguards on civilian nuclear programmes.</P>
        <P>There are two alternative consequences of the comprehensive test ban treaty not entering into force.  First, there could be no test ban treaty but a continued commitment to moratoria.  Alternatively, there could be a resumption of nuclear testing by one or more countries.  The former may look convenient, but there could be problems over compliance which would be difficult to resolve in the absence of an enforceable regime.  The longer the non-enforcement of the treaty continues, the more likely states, legitimate or rogue, will look for ways around the regime.  The fear is that over time, a commitment to the non-testing norm would be likely to erode and accusations of non-compliance could increase international tensions.</P>
        <P>While it may be possible to sustain the unilateral moratoria undertaken by the nuclear testing states for several years, uncertainties and the risk of a resumption of testing will only grow over time.  For example, the condemnation of nuclear testing remained firm despite the south Asian nuclear tests of 1998.  This month&rsquo;s actions by North Korea, however, will not be met with the same response.  A resumption of nuclear testing by this one state could well lead to a cascade of nuclear capable states acquiring more nuclear weapons, conducting their own nuclear tests or additional states acquiring nuclear capability.</P>
        <P>We must not lose heart.  Progress on difficult nuclear issues is possible.  We must continue to work with determination for the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</P>
    
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Legislation is welcome on this important national and international issue.  It is important that we have an informed debate on nuclear weapons and tests and I have listened closely to the contributions of my colleagues.  This is a topical issue given ongoing events in regard to North Korea and Iran.  Countries such as Israel, the United States, Britain, India and Pakistan must be brought into the wider debate.</P>
        <P>It is essential that we are not selective in our opposition to certain countries and nuclear powers.  Nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction are entirely wrong.  They are criminal and immoral and no state should be allowed to develop them.  All Members should unite in this view.</P>
         <P>On the broader issue of nuclear power, we must face up to the debate that is required and conduct it in an informed manner.  Recent claims that nuclear power is the answer to climate change do not reflect reality.  Nuclear power is not carbon emission free.  The entire nuclear cycle from uranium mining onwards produces more <Col N="1952"/>greenhouse gases than most renewable energy sources, with up to 50% more emissions than wind power.  Doubling nuclear power in the United Kingdom, for example, would only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% because the electricity sector accounts for one quarter to one third of all carbon emissions and the transport industry accounts for most of the rest.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A new nuclear power station takes ten years or longer to generate electricity.  Wind farms, on the other hand, can be up and running in less than a year.  We have seen this for ourselves in the developments in wind energy in recent years.  Nuclear power is also expensive.  The nuclear industry in the United Kingdom, for instance, is massively subsidised by the British public.  The installation alone of<?oasys _jy ?>Sizewell B, Britain&rsquo;s newest power station, cost taxpayers some &pound;3.7 billion.  Furthermore, it will cost an estimated &pound;56 billion to decommission Britain&rsquo;s existing ageing power stations.  The magnitude of these resources must cause everybody to pause and reflect on the worthwhile projects to which they could be applied, particularly in regard to world poverty and disadvantaged communities.  It is important to reflect on economic issues such as these as part of this debate.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Nuclear energy is not sustainable because the reserves of uranium ores used to generate nuclear power will run out.  Only 50 years worth of high-grade uranium ores remain in the world.  There may be only 200 years left of all uranium ores, including poor uranium ores which take more energy to mine and process and thus release more carbon emissions.  We must discard the image that nuclear power is clean.   It is dirty and dangerous, posing a threat to the environment and human health.  It produces significant amounts of toxic radioactive waste, some of which remains hazardous for thousands for years.  No safe solution has yet been devised to store it.  Uranium mining, which is the first step in the nuclear power cycle, has been responsible for the deaths of miners throughout the world and causes environmental contamination, cancers and nuclear waste.  Have we no concern for the health of these miners and the conditions under which they must work?</P>
        <P>We must always remember the terrible nuclear accidents that have taken place, including those at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Windscale, now called Sellafield.  Such accidents will plague a new generation of power stations as it did the first.  Moreover, nuclear power brings with it the risk of nuclear terrorism.  In this age of uncertainty, dirty bombs and attacks on power stations are a terrifying prospect.  We must wake up to this reality.  The proliferation of nuclear weapons is inextricably linked to nuclear power by the sheer need for enriched uranium and through the generation of plutonium as a by-product of spent nuclear fuel.  The two industries have been linked since the beginning and a world free of nuclear weapons requires a non-nuclear energy policy.</P><Col N="1953"/>
        <P>I welcome the positive contributions from Members on all sides of the House to this debate.  What is needed, however, is action to protect the planet.  We must develop a safe, sustainable, global and green solution to our energy needs.  This will involve a combination of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures based on safe, effective and proven technoclogies that are already available.  The Government must live up to its commitments under the Kyoto Agreement by investing in sustainable, clean solutions to climate change.  I raise these points because they are linked to the debate on this Bill.  I appeal to everybody to stop this lunacy and take corrective action.</P>
        <P>The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is an attempt to make progress on nuclear disarmament.  I strongly support the broad coalition of individuals and organisations campaigning to secure full replacement of Britain&rsquo;s nuclear weapons system.  Nuclear power is not worth the risk.  Nevertheless, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, has announced that nuclear power is back on the agenda with a vengeance, ignoring the advice of many independent experts that nuclear power represents a dangerous future for Britain.  As an independent country, we must assert our authority on this issue.</P>
        <P>I strongly oppose any plans to attack Iran and I am concerned by suggestions in the media that the United States may be planning nuclear weapons tasking against Iranian facilities.  There is no evidence to support allegations by the United States that Iran&rsquo;s uranium enrichment programme is for the purpose of developing weapons of mass destruction.  I urge Ireland, the EU and governments throughout the world to support the campaign for nuclear disarmament, CND.  Members must work together with community groups to challenge opinion on these issues.</P>
        <P>A British nuclear powered Trident submarine carries 48 independent warheads, each of which has seven times the explosive force of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.  The cost of this weapon to the British public is  &pound;1.5 billion per year.  One might assume we would have learned the lesson of the tragedy in Hiroshima, where 140,000 innocent men, women and children were slaughtered.  I also strongly support CND in its campaign against the United States missile defence system.  Far from being a defensive system, it is rather a system of offence which threatens to provoke nuclear war.  I also oppose any development of space nuclear weapons which are being promoted as so-called &ldquo;weapons for peace&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We must work to end the plutonium trade.  EU countries, particularly those that are members of NATO, must become part of a campaign for a nuclear-free, less militarised Europe and an end to the expansion of the nuclear powers within NATO.  Ireland could play an important role in <Col N="1954"/>terms of influencing NATO.  We must put across the message that nuclear weapons are not an option.  As part of this debate, we must agree to urge these states to get their act together.  Billions of euro and dollars around the world are being spent on nuclear weapons while people are starving.  In recent weeks many people have been at risk in Darfur, and we must assist them.  Many other poor countries also require investment in health, education and employment.  I want to stop the lunacy of investing money in nuclear weapons with which the vast majority of people on this earth want nothing to do.</P>
        <P>Ireland could punch above its weight on the international stage and assert its authority.  We are a small independent country widely respected around the world, and we must assert our authority, particularly in the debate on nuclear energy.  Atomic power is not the answer to climate change and it is not worth the risk.  It is all very well to say that it is a reality that Britain needs nuclear power in the modern age, but I have put forward other sensible options.</P>
        <P>I stress that a safe energy mix of renewable energy sources, cleaned up fossil fuels and energy efficiency measures, all of which are safe, effective and proven technologies, is available now; it is not an impractical fantasy.  Germany, a massive industrial power, is closing its nuclear power stations and moving towards reliance on a non-nuclear mix, an extremely important development that I welcome.  I applaud attempts by any country to review its energy needs and challenge those directly involved in the nuclear industry.</P>
        <P>In recent days we discussed North Korea, but there is also the scandal of countries that have nuclear weapons and do not say much about it.  Over the summer more than 1,100 innocent men, women and children were killed in Lebanon in the conflict on the border with Israel.  Another hidden reality is that Israel has nuclear weapons.  The official Israeli policy is neither to confirm nor deny the existence of a nuclear weapons programme, although we all know that it has one.  One good man, Mordechai Vanunu, spent 18 years in prison for revealing its existence and is still prevented from leaving Israel.  That Israeli citizen wished to expose what was going on in his country.</P>
        <P>While I also challenge countries such as Pakistan, imagine what would happen if nuclear weapons were used in the Middle East conflict.  We must be extremely careful and strong.  There is a major crisis in the Middle East that we are trying to resolve.  I welcome our sending 150 soldiers to Lebanon to contribute to peacekeeping efforts there and I commend those involved in that magnificent work.  Imagine what would happen if a nuclear power entered the race and flexed its muscles on such issues.  I believe that the main reason that Israel did not deploy its nuclear arsenal in 1973 was that neither the USSR nor <Col N="1955"/>the USA was willing to risk such an escalation, both intervening forcefully with their clients.</P>
        <P>However, such countries must also examine their own consciences when it comes to dealing with nuclear weapons.  Russia and the USA must face the reality that both their citizens and ours want nothing to do with such nuclear weapons.  I seek a change in policy and mindset and a negotiated peace with justice in the various conflicts around the world.</P>
        <P>The Nuclear Test Ban Bill 2006 is entitled &ldquo;an Act to give effect to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 September 1996&rdquo;.  It is important that we support the United Nations in its attempts.  However, there is no point in treaties or deals if one does not implement the recommendations.  We should know from Irish history that when one has deals and treaties, one must implement them, particularly when they promise sensible solutions.  The Nuclear Test Ban Bill 2006 is a major step in the right direction and I urge people to implement its positive recommendations.</P>
        <P>I welcome the international agreements and other positive measures of recent years in the field of nuclear disarmament, including reductions in the arsenals of nuclear weapons as well as in the prevention of nuclear proliferation in all its aspects.  It is important that we row in behind such international agreements.  The verification section of the treaty reads as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">In order to verify compliance with this Treaty, a verification regime shall be established consisting of the following elements:</P>
        <P LI="2">(a) An International Monitoring System;</P>
        <P LI="2">(b) Consultation and clarification;</P>
        <P LI="2">(c) On-site inspections; and</P>
        <P LI="2">(d) Confidence-building measures.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Those four elements are particularly important.  We require an international section with a strong presence monitoring the situation.  We also need consultation and clarification and when I speak of &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; I do not mean lecturing.  The on-site inspections are also essential since the countries and inspectors must have the authority to assess the situation.  However, we must also build up the confidence-building measures under paragraph (d).</P>
        <P>There is currently great mistrust in the Middle East towards many western countries and we must face up to that reality.  It has led to hostility between two cultures and civilisations, and it saddens me to see that happen, especially when I see the many good and noble people of vision on both sides who are trying to break down barriers.  All legislators, Deputies, Senators and Ministers, have a responsibility.  If one has the honour of being elected to the Oireachtas, which is <Col N="1956"/>extremely difficult, it is very important that one is directly involved in confidence-building measures.  We have seen this in our conflict in recent days in the shape of the St. Andrews agreement.  We must be active in assisting those from opposing sides, creating space for them so that they can reach a resolution.  There is an onus on us to do so.</P>
        <P>Regarding the on-site inspections under paragraph (c), section 34 reads as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">Each State Party has the right to request an on-site inspection in accordance with the provisions of this Article and Part II of the Protocol in the territory or in any other place under the jurisdiction or control of any State Party, or in any area beyond the jurisdiction or control of any State.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to comment once more on inspection.  If we had allowed Hans Blix and his team to deal with the Iraqi situation, we would not now be witnessing such a horrific nightmare in that country.  I challenged those countries that undermined the work of inspectors who went to Iraq to try to resolve the crisis in their relations with the country.  They were blown out of the water and their integrity destroyed, although they were ultimately proven right.  There were no weapons of mass destruction there, yet they led to a huge international conflict based on lies and spin.  People should hang their heads in shame at the great numbers being killed daily in Iraq, particularly those who, having supported that war, remain silent on it.  I commend such people as Hans Blix for doing something to prevent war and disputes around the world.</P>
        <P>Article VI, which deals with the settlement of disputes, reads as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">Disputes that may arise concerning the application or the interpretation of this Treaty shall be settled in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Treaty and in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We are all mature enough to settle disputes and accommodate difference on the broader international stage.</P>
        <P>I urge rejection of all nuclear weapons and nuclear powers, and of the weapons of mass destruction dominant in the world.  Any State that uses, possesses or tests them must be challenged and exposed.  There is never an excuse for manufacturing or possessing nuclear weapons, particularly in a world that needs money to invest in health care, anti-poverty measures, education, child care and employment.  That is where we should spend taxpayers&rsquo; money and resources.  We should not be afraid to tell the British, American and Israeli public where Ireland stands and let them know that we are opposed to weapons of mass destruction.  This is not a high moral <Col N="1957"/>ground approach, but a sensible outlook on life and a sensible vision for the future.  It is also a mark of respect to the 140,000 men, women and children slaughtered in Hiroshima.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the opportunity to take part in this important debate.  I hope the treaty will go a long way towards creating international and world peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the opportunity to contribute to the discussion on the Bill.  Much of the content of the Bill and of what is involved in its implementation is highly technical, but that should not stop us from commenting on the general principles involved.  There will be little public interest in the content of the Bill, despite the fact the topic is important to the world at large.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s statement that it is extremely unlikely that the Act will ever be called into play in Ireland.</P>
        <P>A year after the 20-year commemoration of the world&rsquo;s worst ever nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, after various other disasters mentioned by Members and in the current climate of the North Korean nuclear test, the issue of nuclear weapons is clearly an ever-present and more complicated issue.  The Three Mile Island accident and incidents at Sellafield which have been mentioned illustrate the danger involved with nuclear power.  We must accept that a serious accident at a nuclear station has the power to do catastrophic harm to people and the environment.  Human and-or mechanical error could result in an accident killing several thousand people, harming hundreds of thousands in the long term, contaminating large areas of land and costing billions of euro.  It will be too late to discuss the issue after such an event.</P>
        <P>All Members of the Oireachtas will agree that we should have total nuclear disarmament and a ban on nuclear testing.  The least we can do is give a clear indication of our wishes by going ahead with the implementation of our legislation to put the ban into effect.  The ban will enshrine in legislation the nuclear test ban treaty adopted by the UN in 1996.  The treaty was open for signature in 1999, but it has yet to come into force.  As already mentioned, some 176 countries have signed the treaty and 135 have ratified it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It should be a matter of concern to us that the international approach to the issue has taken ten years to reach this point.  There were various attempts in 1963 and since 1968 to get some control over additional nuclear weapons.  This treaty, which tries to ban nuclear tests entirely, is part of the same process.  Those of us looking in from the outside are entitled to question the commitment of some of the countries in the process, particularly those that have not signed up to it.  The USA has been mentioned in this regard.  Nevertheless, we should pay due recognition to the efforts of the US and the Soviet states for the <Col N="1958"/>programme they carried out of dismantling or decommissioning a significant stockpile of nuclear weapons.  We should remember this.</P>
        <P>We are also entitled to question how seriously we in Ireland take the issue.  During discussions last week in the Chamber, at least one Member thought it was an item to joke about.  We often only see the serious side of the issue when things go wrong.  That is when we seriously appreciate the potential danger of nuclear power.  Things are going wrong in a number of countries.  It is important that if any our Ministers or other representatives try to use their position to dissuade a country such as North Korea from carrying out tests and are asked whether we fully support the ban, they can give a positive answer.  If we want to be effective, we would be cheeky and foolish to be in the reverse situation.  It is right and proper to put the legislation through the House now.  In doing so we are not conducting a time-wasting exercise as was suggested last week.</P>
        <P>The major part of the discussion on the nuclear ban issue relates to who is seen as the aggressor.  Deciding who are the aggressors is a matter of perspective.  The bottom line is that in the event of a nuclear battle, it will make little difference whether one supports the United States, Israel, India, Pakistan or North Korea.  The effect will be equally devastating for everyone.</P>
        <P>It is imperative that the US is persuaded to ratify the treaty.  It is little use for the US to call on North Korea to refrain from tests if the US itself does not sign up to it.  In that context, while Ireland may be viewed as a small player on the world stage, we have a relatively powerful voice for change.  As a nation we must continue to stress the need for co-operative efforts to ensure the continuing march towards nuclear disarmament and should be loud in our condemnation of all nuclear nesting, whether in the East or West.  In order to use our voice to greatest effect, we should have our house in order.  Instead of having a laugh about dealing with the issue now, we should be embarrassed for not having dealt with it long before now.</P>
        <P>A section in the Bill states an Irish citizen carrying out such an explosion outside the State will also be guilty of an offence.  How can this be implemented?  If, for example, an Irish person gets a job in North Korea and is involved in nuclear testing, how can we prevent this or enforce the legislation?  I appreciate Britain has its own rules, but the legislation is ideal for an all-island approach as is appropriate to all issues of this nature.  I support the Bill and hope it will go through the House speedily.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed for their constructive input.  This year marks the tenth anniversary of the opening for <Col N="1959"/>signature of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  Given recent events in North Korea, it is more urgent than ever that the international community does all it can to encourage further signature and ratification of the treaty.</P>
        <P>The treaty will enter into force when the 44 countries it names have ratified it.  It is important, given Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing position on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation that we have the necessary legislation in place to transpose the treaty.  The comprehensive test ban treaty will make an important contribution towards preventing the proliferation of materials, technologies and knowledge that can be used for nuclear weapons &mdash; one of the most important challenges facing the world.   The treaty verification system will also bring scientific and civil benefits, including tsunami warning systems and possibly other disaster alert systems through civil and scientific applications of wave form and radium technologies and use of data.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The telecommunications market in Ireland is fully liberalised and open.  Statutory responsibility for the regulation of the electronic communication sector rests with the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and the Regulations transposing the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications Networks and Services.  It is not, nor will it ever be, a function of the regulator to become involved in contract debt disputes between two companies.</P>
        <P>As the Minister with responsibility for policy in the sector, I am concerned about the disruption and inconvenience caused to so many customers and I have asked ComReg to examine how, in light of the recent situation regarding Smart Telecom, this could best be prevented from happening in the future.  All options will be considered, including legislation if necessary.</P>
        <P>In the context of energy tariff increases, both the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, responsibility for the regulation of electricity and gas tariffs lies with the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is the independent energy regulator.</P>
        <P>The CER undertook a rigorous examination and consultation process in advance of publication of it decisions on the tariff increases.  The CER has published its decisions in detail.  Together with the Electricity Supply Board and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, the CER has made a full presentation on these deliberations to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>The scenario in early October that gave rise to cheap gas on the wholesale markets was atypical.  Overall demand, including heating demand, was at a low level given the mild start to the autumn and supply levels were very high because the new Langeled pipeline from Norway was being tested at maximum capacity at a time when such flows were not needed.  Long-term contract prices are more relevant to the cost of consumer energy bills than short-term day trading prices, as prevailed in early October.  Despite some easing of gas prices in recent months the overall view of regu<Col N="1961"/>lators, analysts and suppliers is that costs will remain high at least until next year.</P>
        <P>The regulator has indicated he is open to reviewing tariffs should there be a significant and sustained downward trend in costs on the wholesale markets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his admission and his willingness to take action regarding the outage in the telecommunications area.  Will he elucidate further, with a view to setting a precise deadline and timetable to deal with that situation whereby innocent subscribers became the victims and where the delivery of services either was not properly anticipated or people were not made aware of negotiations taking place and were arbitrarily left without a service?  Will the Minister give an undertaking that it will not happen again and that he will take the necessary action to prevent it?</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the function of the regulator re gas and electricity price increases.  The Minister should also be concerned about it.  I presume he is aware that if this trend continues and these prices are left in place for the next 12 months, there will be large-scale loss of manufacturing jobs, in addition to jobs in the services sector, especially in the transport area.  Is the Minister also aware that from last May the international indicators on energy prices clearly implied that production was up and that countless people were talking up the price of gas and oil?  There was a reason for that.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give an undertaking to the House that before this goes further, he will order an inquiry into the information that led to the dramatic price increases in gas and electricity and will he relate that to the information which I know he has because he reads some of the same e-mails I receive?  Will he carry out an examination of the impact on those industries that are now crying out for action?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister order a further review of the price increases and the reasons therefor?  If, for example, it is shown that there are good and compelling reasons for a reduction in the area, will he authorise it or order it, or would that require legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation that is in place gives responsibility for price increases to the independent regulator.  The reason the legislation was put in place was to prevent interference from the political system in the price of gas and oil with the aim of ensuring a level playing field for anybody who wanted to enter the electricity and gas markets.  We have gone down this route because of EU legislation and directives.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that other options existed at the time which we might have taken, but we did not take them and we cannot reverse out of the one we are in at present.  It is not open <Col N="1962"/>to me, as Minister, or to the Government, under the current legislation to direct the regulator in any way on prices.  The regulator has spoken for himself.  He came before the relevant committee, which I commend for taking action and requesting his presence, and he explained in detail how he arrived at his decision.</P>
        <P>It is probably good from the point of view of soundbites to refer to immediately reversing the price rises, but that is not a realistic option.  The price of oil and gas has increased substantially since this time last year.  The Deputy is correct that the price has now begun to fall.  Oil and gas are internationally traded commodities.  BGE depends on imports from or through the UK for 86% of its supply.  It would be a help if we had our own supply of gas.</P>

        <Quest> if, in the context of the 34% price hike in gas prices and the near 20% increase in electricity prices, he will introduce legislation to establish a consumer panel within CER to ensure consumer needs are adequately taken into account by the regulator in energy pricing policy, and as recommended in the recent Deloitte &amp; Touche report in the electricity sector; the measures he is recommending to the Department of Finance and the Department of Social and Family Affairs to tackle the growing level of fuel and energy poverty in society here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[33724/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Under EU regulations on the internal energy markets the Commission for Energy Regulation has a direct legal obligation in regard to electricity and gas consumers.  These include the requirement to protect the interests of final customers and to take account of the needs of vulnerable customers.  The regulator is also required to ensure that all customers are supplied with electricity and gas of a specified quality at reasonable prices.</P><Col N="1963"/>
        <P>I welcome the stronger focus on consumer protection as part of the move to liberalised markets.  The interests of customers are now better safeguarded within the regulatory regime.  In carrying out this function the CER regularly engages with customers and customer representative organisations.</P>
        <P>The CER had intended to develop specific consumer panels for the gas and electricity sectors.  This proposal has been superseded by the establishment of the National Consumer Agency, NCA, by my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The agency&rsquo;s remit is to represent and progress consumers&rsquo; interests across all economic sectors.  It is also envisaged that the agency will provide a strong consumer voice in the regulated sectors, including energy.</P>
        <P>The CER is working closely with the NCA to set up appropriate arrangements, including a memorandum of understanding on information sharing and consultation and co-operation.  The CER is also establishing a dedicated consumer complaint handling team that will handle all complaints about energy suppliers.  These are positive steps forward in the interests of energy consumers and I commend the CER and the NCA for their collaboration to date.</P>
        <P>Addressing fuel poverty is a critical aspect of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy as outlined in the Green Paper.  Support is provided through several programmes, including the SEI warmer homes scheme and low income housing programme, the household benefits package for electricity and gas allowances and the Department of Social and Family Affairs&rsquo;s national fuel scheme for fuel allowances as well as social welfare rates and other benefits.</P>
        <P>The impact of high electricity and gas prices was recognised by the Government in last month&rsquo;s announcement by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, concerning the introduction of improved household benefits, which will protect 340,000 people from energy price increases.</P>
   
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>From an overall perspective, the first step in assessing the adequacy of coverage of the existing schemes and measures is to compile a comprehensive directory, as suggested in the Green Paper, to allow an identification of gaps or weaknesses.  The Green Paper also addresses wider issues around competitiveness in an environment of high and rising energy prices.</P>
        <P>The Government is holding a two-month period of debate and consultation on the Green Paper.  The two key questions for consultation are while a significant proportion of our energy prices are determined by international oil and gas <Col N="1964"/>prices, what actions should be taken domestically to reduce the cost of electricity and gas to consumers and what further action should be taken to alleviate fuel poverty.  Following this consultation period, I will give careful consideration to the views and proposals of stakeholders on all aspects of the Green Paper, including energy prices and fuel poverty.  In this context, I will also consider whether legislative or other measures are appropriate or necessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak about the impact on businesses and ordinary people.  Is it not a fact that the savage gas and electricity price rises are having a devastating impact on business?  Of the agencies that represent business, ISME claims that energy price rises in the past five years have been the No. 1 enemy of SMEs, the Irish Exporters Association warns that the large increase in energy costs must be addressed urgently and IBEC states that 52,408 employees in 120 companies are at immediate risk because of the failures of the Minister&rsquo;s policies.  He is responsible because he can make legislation and change the CER.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can tell his constituent that we are not facing that era again.  Recently, the Government, which has increased the amount of payments to old aged pensioners substantially, increased the fuel, electricity and gas allowances for elderly people.  The Deputy can assure his constituent that the Government is cognisant of the effects of high prices on the elderly and those who are less well off.</P>
        <P>It is simplistic to say the Government can ignore solutions or the fact that oil and gas prices are increasing.  As outlined in the Green Paper, I am interested in reducing the ESB&rsquo;s prices and introducing more competition to the market to compete with the ESB and encourage it to slim down, be more effective and produce cheaper electricity.  I hope the Deputy will support this measure.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the revisions he intends to make to the construction of the second phase of metropolitan area networks to ensure cost effective last mile connections for the end user and a backhaul connection from the MANs to the broader telecommunications network. </Quest>
        <QRef>[33854/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The second phase of the metropolitan area networks, MANs, programme will give rise to the construction of open access, high-speed fibre broadband networks in more than 90 towns.  Some 22 networks are already <Col N="1966"/>under construction and the remaining MANs will commence later this year and early next year.  As in phase one of the programme, each network includes a co-location facility situated near Eircom&rsquo;s local exchange.  In addition to facilitating last mile connections, the co-location facility allows service providers adequate space to house their equipment.</P>
        <P>In designing the second phase networks, the local authorities were asked to identify all businesses in the towns and estimate their likely demands for telecommunications services.  This exercise will help to identify the potential end users of each network.  Connections to these users are included in the network designs.</P>
        <P>Backhaul is available to all the MANs through Eircom&rsquo;s network.  Some MANs are also connected to alternative backhaul networks where they are available.  My Department is currently exploring options to enhance competitive backhaul connectivity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The first phase of the programme is not working.  It has cost approximately &euro;80 million and its reported annual turnover was cited as &euro;3.5 million in April, a poor return on a State investment by any measure.</P>
        <P>From presentations to the relevant committees by the operators of the MANs, it is clear that a different system is needed.  According to Mr. Conal Henry, the chief executive officer of E-Net, the operators need to connect directly to the buildings through which the MANs run.  I have heard nothing different today.  The cost to isolated areas in County Donegal, for example, means there is no effective and competitive backhaul network.</P>
        <P>Companies like Smart Telecom are pulling out of the broadband business and Eircom announced 100 new broadband roll-outs today.  Why are we spending &euro;170 million to duplicate fibre already in the ground without a return?  The Minister must consider taxpayers&rsquo; interests rather than an ideological commitment to this project.  Are we getting value for &euro;170 million and why are we digging up roads to put down fibre optic cables that are already there or in a neighbouring road?  Will the Minister change the project before the Committee of Public Accounts examines the matter in a year or two and determines it was a mistake, that we built something based on a positive idea and that it did not work?  As the MANs are not working, what will the Minister do differently?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has amazed me because he normally examines all sides of a proposition before making statements on it.  He sounds like a spokesman for a well known company that has opposed the MANs from day one because they would provide it with competition in various places.</P><Col N="1967"/>
        <P>The programme will not pay for itself in one, two or three years.  It is a long-term investment, as was the investment in the Atlantic crossing that connected us to international broadband services.  The PAC examined the crossing and decided that the investment of &euro;80 million was a good one.  It has not repaid the State since it started operating.</P>
        <P>The MANs programme does not duplicate fibre in many places.  Indeed, the programme is providing fibre to many places that would never have had fibre otherwise.  We started the project because there was no roll-out of broadband by the incumbent.  Instead of taking the incumbent&rsquo;s route of copper wires, we decided to put in place fibre optic cable, which is the cable of the future.  In five to ten years, we will be trying to complete a full fibre optic network.  Whether this will be done by the State, the telecommunications companies or a combination is open to debate, but it is the direction we must take if we want the type of broadband roll-out referred to.  I am sure the Deputy is anxious to have this done and I urge him to be more careful in his assessment of the programme.  It is not meant to have repaid the State by this stage and it will not do so for another ten or 15 years.  It is not in direct competition with DSL or copper-based lines.  Rather, it is providing a future-proof network.</P>

However, I recognise the reality that Eircom still holds all the cards and that the Minister&rsquo;s attempt to set up an independent network will not make any sense unless one can go the last mile and unless there is a backhaul network.  The Minister is doing neither and he has not answered that pertinent question here.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated in September that he is now looking at some other new innovative ways, possibly using the private sector, to provide broadband connection.  Can he give a brief outline of what they might be?</P>

	<P>If I conveyed the impression that I was accusing Deputy Ryan of being a spokesman for Eircom, I am not and I accept his bona fides in that regard.  I also accept that MANs Phase I is not perfect and will not be perfect, and the issue of backhaul must be addressed.  The issue of the fibre to the kerb must be addressed also.  If Deputy Ryan was focusing on those part<Col N="1968"/>icular issues, I do not have a significant difficulty with that but the MANs project will not be, as he described it, a waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money.

	<P>The lost at sea scheme was introduced in June 2001, following consultation with the fishing industry representative organisations, to enable qualifying applicants under the scheme to receive replacement capacity in respect of fishing boats lost at sea between 1980 and the establishment of the Fishing Boat Register in 1990.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 31 December 2001.</P>
        <P>In January 2003, over 12 months after the closing date, an application under the scheme was received in the Department from a particular applicant, the subject of Deputy Perry&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P>In December 2004, the Office of the Ombudsman wrote to the Department indicating that it was examining a complaint from this applicant on their application under the lost at sea scheme and seeking specified information.  The Department provided full information and documentation required.</P>
        <P>In February 2006, the Ombudsman wrote to the Department stating that she was going to carry out a formal investigation into the application and requesting certain files, which the Department duly provided.  On 13 July 2006, the Ombudsman invited the Department to comment on the statement of complaint.  The Department returned comments on 31 July 2006.  It is clear that the investigation by the Ombudsman is ongoing and that the Department has fully co-operated with the investigation at all times.  For obvious reasons, it would not be appropriate for me to require the Department to initiate an internal investigation while the Ombudsman&rsquo;s investigations are still ongoing.  However, I will <Col N="1969"/>give serious consideration to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on the conclusion of her investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Minister of State explain that senior civil servants expressly stated the view, in announcing this scheme, that it would open the floodgates?  How is it possible that two persons, both constituents of the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, received 75% of the funding allocated, which was a substantial amount of money?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree with the Ombudsman that the scheme was seriously flawed?  The Ombudsman wrote that, accordingly, her office reverted to the Department requesting it outline how it proposes to deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>There were 120 files and eight files which the then Minister, according to a handwritten note from him, wanted ring-fenced.  Of the six files where there was payment, four were from within his own constituency.</P>
        <P>This is a serious matter.  It is a complete cover-up.  Never in the history of the State has such a report issued from the Ombudsman clearly indicating the compliance of the Department and of senior servants in a cover-up on this scale.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no cover-up.  Some 67 applications were received and six were successful.  The Ombudsman wrote on behalf of a specific applicant and we in the Department have fully co-operated with the Ombudsman&rsquo;s request for information, files and documentation.</P>
        <P>I can assure Deputy Perry that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s investigation is not complete.  Deputy Perry stated in his question that it was complete but it is still ongoing.  I can assure the Deputy that our Department will continue to work in co-operation with the Ombudsman.  There is a perception that the Ombudsman is investigating the scheme.  The Ombudsman is investigating the specific allegation that was made by one applicant and we are co-operating fully with the Ombudsman in this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ombudsman is investigating the allegation that this scheme was, as she has stated, seriously flawed.  It was closed down within 24 weeks.  The Byrne family lost a father and a son and three members of the crew, and it was quite extraordinary that the Department did not have the file on this.</P>
        <P>There were 120 files.  Senior civil servants advised the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, that he should not have announced this scheme, but he wanted this scheme to be ring-fenced to between six to eight files and 75% of the funding allocated went to two of his constituents.</P>
        <P>This has been in the public domain time and time again.  Is the Minister of State saying that when the Ombudsman reports this matter will be dealt with decisively?  This scheme was dealing retrospectively, from 1980 onwards, with vessels <Col N="1970"/>lost at sea.  It was quite extraordinary that the Department did not have a record of one of the biggest losses off the Irish coast; the family had not been contacted and the announcement was concealed.  This case must be dealt with decisively.  It is extraordinary that we must go to the Ombudsman to deal with this case when the Minister should be dealing with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ombudsman made a request on behalf of a specific applicant to the Department.  We did not ask the Ombudsman to investigate it.</P>
        <P>When the Ombudsman, who is the most independent person in the country, is investigating a complaint, it would not be for me to carry out an internal investigation at the same time.  What I am saying to Deputy Perry is that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s investigation is ongoing, we should wait until her final report is available to the Department and, as I stated at the outset, I will give serious consideration to Ombudsman&rsquo;s report when it becomes available to me.</P>

        <Quest> when he will bring forward legislation to ensure that the telecommunications sector is effectively regulated in view of the ongoing Smart Telecom debacle and the recent disconnection of over 45,000 Smart Telecom customers from their telephone and broadband services; if he will adopt ComReg&rsquo;s suggestion of establishing a statutory basis for notice of withdrawal of service by a telecommunications operator; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[33856/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated earlier, the telecommunications market in Ireland is fully liberalised and open.</P>
        <P>Statutory responsibility for the regulation of the electronic communication sector rests with the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and the regulations transposing the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications Networks and Services.</P>
        <P>As the Minister with responsibility for policy in the sector, I am concerned about the disruption and inconvenience caused to so many customers and I have asked ComReg to examine how, in light of the recent situation regarding Smart Telecom, this could best be prevented from happening in the future.  All options, including legislation if necessary, will be considered following that review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated two and a half weeks ago, when 45,000 people woke up to find they had no telephone or broadband <Col N="1971"/>services, that he would rush emergency legislation through the House.  Almost three weeks later, there is no sign of it.</P>
        <P>Ms Isolde Goggin, chairperson of ComReg, stated that she would like to see a statutory basis for a notice of withdrawal of service, in other words, every company would have to give a notice of withdrawal of service.  Could the Minister have provided this already and why is he not providing it?</P>
        <P>Has the Minister asked ComReg for a review of this debacle?  When we invigilated it at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, it was unclear.  For example, the media tell us that ComReg knew about this for three weeks and 19 termination notices had been issued by Eircom to Smart Telecom.  Was that the case?  Can the Minister confirm that ComReg knew well about this and to some extent, like the little boy who cried wolf, was not ready when the wolf finally appeared?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister follow the activities of the joint committee?  Did he see, for example, Mr. Ois&iacute;n Fanning when he complained bitterly, almost tearfully, to the committee about portability, and the difficulties of enabling exchanges and of getting broadband without changing numbers, and asked that the Minister, who leads this House in legislation on communications, take some action?  Did he feel at that stage he had a responsibility to act in regard to the only independent Irish company in the market but failed to do so?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Is the Minister concerned about the business models used by companies in this market?  Earlier this week, Mr. Joe Duffy presented a programme that featured a litany of complaints about another operator that offers an apparent low cost package.  However, citizen after citizen rang the programme bitterly upset about the treatment they received.  At the end of the day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This is slightly different from the Deputy&rsquo;s breathless description of rushing emergency legislation through the House, which I never stated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il never rushes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that the situation that emerged on 2 October, whether it is addressed by legislation or regulation, should not happen.  I am not sure whether a 24-hour notice would do much good in similar circumstances and, therefore, I will maximise the notice customers will receive of being cut off.</P>
        <P>Everybody following the telecommunications industry knew there had been signs for some time, and more frequent signs in the three or four weeks leading up to the cut-off, that there was a major problem.  Smart Telecom also knew that.  We all beat up on Eircom occasionally but, in this instance, Smart Telecom was also not a shining knight.  This is an industry and one company owed another money.  I do not care who owes money to whom but I care if customers are cut off as a result, and that is what I want to address.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to local loop unbundling, number portability and so on.  These are matters for the regulator and they have been legislated for.  Talks are ongoing between the regulator and the industry to ensure they are rolled out as quickly as possible.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 34 and 83 together.</P>
        <P>Security of energy supply is a key imperative for Ireland and the European Union.  The relatively small size of the Irish electricity market underlines the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply, promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity market into the wider European market.  The recently published energy policy Green Paper, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver enhanced interconnection on the island of Ireland, as well as with Britain, as a priority.  This is also the way forward envisaged at European level.</P>
        <P>The Government has endorsed plans for the construction of a 500 MW electricity interconnector between Ireland and Wales.  On foot of the Government decision, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has been requested to proceed with a competition to select a developer on a hybrid-merchant basis to secure the construction of this interconnector by 2012 at the latest.  The CER has also been requested to arrange for EirGrid and ESB to expedite the technical work of route selection and necessary grid reinforcement works.  The Government decision provides that the interconnector, when completed, will be owned by EirGrid to ensure this strategic asset remains in public ownership.</P>
        <P>To underpin the development process, I have proposed new arrangements in respect of the construction and operation of future interconnectors in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006.  The Bill provides that the CER may, with ministerial consent, secure the construction of an interconnector by one or more means, including by competitive tender.  Such consent will be contingent on Government approval.  Planning for decisions on further interconnection with Britain or potentially with the European mainland will begin in 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What will be the ultimate cost of the interconnector?  What is its intended route?  What implications, if any, will selecting the developer on a hybrid basis have for the State?  What impact will the interconnector have on the electricity market when it is opened in 2012?  For example, how will it affect the marginal cost, the retail sales index and the role of the incumbent, the ESB?  In other words, in what way will it promote competition?  What impact will it have on renewables?  What role will wind power play in the all-Ireland market from 2012 onwards?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reluctant to give a figure for the ultimate cost of the interconnector before <Col N="1974"/>the groundwork has been done on specific routes and so on.  I have heard a ballpark figure of &euro;500 million on a number of occasions but I would not go to the wall on that.  The cost could be higher or considerably lower than that when the necessary works at each end are taken into account.  Until I have more detail on the specifics of the route, seabed surveys and so on, it is pure guess work.</P>
        <P>The fact that it will be a hybrid scheme will not have affect the State, as it leaves the question of financing open.  One of the reasons for the interconnector is to enhance security of supply.  It will provide 500 MW, which will be available &ldquo;at the flick of a switch&rdquo;.  It will increase the opportunity for other operators to buy electricity from companies other than those in the small pool in Ireland and sell it on in the domestic market.  That should help competition and consumers regarding price.</P>
        <P>With regard to renewables, the interconnector will assist our efforts to reach targets.  The major problem with wind energy is intermittency, and electricity supply is, therefore, only available 30% of the time.  The fact we have effective back-up that can almost be turned on at a switch will greatly help the position with regard to the extra renewables in the system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>How much control of the interconnectors, if any, will the State have?  How many interconnectors will ultimately be provided?  Are plans by one private enterprise group to build an interconnector at an advanced stage and within a similar completion timescale to that referred to by the Minister?  With regard to the Minister&rsquo;s recently launched Green Paper, a reference was made which would appear to confuse whether the Minister&rsquo;s intention is to use publicly built or funded interconnectors or privately built or funded interconnectors.  Some interconnectors will begin from the United Kingdom and some will begin here.  Which project will begin first?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The interconnector will be completely State-owned through EirGrid, which will have complete control of it.  There is one North-South interconnector, there will be a second North-South interconnector and there will be a third interconnector which will run east-west.  These projects will be completed at the latest by 2012.  I envisage a need for one more interconnector at that stage.  As I stated in reply to earlier questions, we will begin planning for that further interconnector by 2010.  It might be another east-west interconnector or, given the need for security of supply, it might link Ireland to the European mainland.</P>
        <P>With regard to how it might be built, the Commission for Energy Regulation is responsible for designing the competition.  A private contractor may end up designing and building it, but ownership will remain with the State.  There are two <Col N="1975"/>basic options for financing the projects.  The first is Exchequer funding, which has not been used to date.  However, the discussion point put forward in the Green Paper is that this is critical infrastructure which perhaps, with some other infrastructure, should be paid for by the Exchequer because it is so critical.  The other option would be to finance the project the way every other piece of energy infrastructure is financed, namely, the companies would get a rate of return each year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the consumers who have to pay for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is the consumers.  There is an argument that taxpayers are consumers.  I am open to discussion as to whether they should pay directly or through taxes.</P>
        <P>Deputy Durkan referred to a private company.  The Department received correspondence from that company but, so far as I know, it has not approached CER, which would be the first port of call.  I understand the company has not contacted my counterpart in Wales as I met him four or five weeks ago and he was not aware of it.  Perhaps it has made contacts more recently but, up to two or three weeks ago, it had not made contacts like that, although it claims to have finance in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In what year did the Department receive the proposal or begin consideration of the proposal for the new east-west interconnector?  If we believe we will need a further interconnector with the UK or mainland Europe, why must we wait until 2010 before beginning planning for it?  With regard to the Minister&rsquo;s Welsh counterpart, how do we know the system operator in the UK will allow us to have easy and full access to that system?  If the UK system is under pressure at a particular time, do we know we will be given access to 500 MW from it?  What reinforcements are necessary on the Welsh side to provide the proper infrastructure transmission network for this interconnector?  Has the Minister obtained agreement from the British Government with regard to that investment or must we invest directly in some of the grid reinforcement that might have to occur in the UK?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I missed the first question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When was the concept of a new east-west interconnector first raised in the Department?  I am concerned this process has taken several years.  Given the number of consultants and reports involved, the matter seems to have been ongoing for years despite the urgency of the situation when one considers our energy crunch in terms of electricity demand and capacity availability.  This critical project should have <Col N="1976"/>been fast-tracked.  I am concerned it has been sitting for three or four years with people gazing at it rather than doing anything about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one of the dilemmas we in Government must always face.  If the Deputy ever happens to be on this side of the House, he will probably realise this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unlikely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Sometimes we get accused of moving too fast on a project, of not thinking matters through and not foreseeing all of the difficulties.  In other cases, as the Deputy rightly states, matters go on for a long time before we get from the concept to the project.  I cannot give the Deputy a date but it was probably four years ago that a decision was made that there should be an interconnector.  We tried to do this on a merchant basis but when all the procedures were finished, we discovered there was not the required interest in the market.  The Government then decided it would consider alternative options.  It was through CER that we commissioned a report from KPMG, which made a number of recommendations in July of this year, and it is on that basis that we are moving forward.</P>
        <P>The decision in principle to have an interconnector has been in place for three or four years.  In fact, there was a decision in principle that there would be two 500 MW lines.  However, the recent KPMG report stated that two 500 MW lines would not be desirable at this stage because they might have the opposite effect in the market to the effect we want.  So, in one sense, the fact that we had to go back to the drawing board and make a further study at least brought out that point, and we probably saved &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million in that regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of how we know we will be able to make the connection and install reinforcements, the decisions on these matters will be made in consultation with our Welsh and UK colleagues.  The studies carried out reveal there are two possible routes.  Deputy Broughan asked me a question on this matter earlier but I did not get to reply to it.  There are two possible routes, north and south Wales, to two sites on this side of the Irish Sea.  Reinforcement work would be needed on both sides of the Irish Sea.  Such work would be in the interests of whatever power company we will be dealing with in the UK, although the position there is not the same as it is here.  The UK company will examine that and make a decision on the basis of the possibility of extra business for it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I received the report of the independent group to which the Deputy referred earlier this week and it is to be presented to Government for its consideration shortly.  Until such time as the report is presented to Government, I am not in a position to comment on its recommendations or implementation.  The question of publication of the report is a matter for the Government, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and myself. </P>
        <P>Given the steps involved in putting in place an appropriate regime to take effect from January 2007, including, for example, public consultation about any change to the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations, decisions about the report must be taken quickly.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have undertaken to follow the recommendations of the standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission to fully align the management of the fishery with its scientific advice for 2007.  I established the independent group, to which the Deputy referred, earlier this year to examine the implications for the commercial sector in 2007 and beyond arising from this alignment.  The group was expected to make recommendations on the options available to address any financial hardship arising for individuals involved in commercial salmon fishing.</P>
        <P>I expect that the National Salmon Commission, having considered the advice of the standing scientific committee and the fishery managers, and in the context of the report of the independent group, to bring forward in accordance with its terms of reference advice on measures for management of the wild salmon fishery in 2007.  The National Salmon Commission is aware of the importance of my receiving its advice at the earliest possible date.  I understand it has a number of meetings scheduled over the coming weeks.  I expect to receive its advice in sufficient time for the publication of the necessary draft regulations governing the 2007 wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme.  There will be a period for public consultation prior to enactment before the start of the 2007 season.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State indicate if the report will be published openly or will it turn into a Deloitte &amp; Touche affair, so to speak, whereby it will not be published for months and then eventually published in an underhand way?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned addressing financial hardship for individuals in his reply and <Col N="1978"/>we know the advice of the National Salmon Commission given last year.  Members of the public are generally aware of the impact of the continued multi-stock fishing on the nation&rsquo;s reputation.  Has the Minister of State considered any detailed measures or costings in regard to addressing financial hardship for individuals?  Would it be of the order of the previous scheme in regard to those fishing for white fish in the south east, or would it be much more narrowly based?</P>
        <P>The EU habitats legislation was considered yesterday at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  How will that legislation impact on the Minister of State&rsquo;s decision?</P>

At that time I stated that this report would be presented to the Government following consideration by me, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey and our Department.  We expect to do that as quickly as possible.  Once the Government has made a decision on it, the report will be published.</P>

With regard to the recommendations by the scientists and the National Salmon Commission, is the Minister of State saying that he will act entirely on the scientific recommendations to Government? </P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed to accepting the scientific advice for 2007.  As agreed by Members on all sides of the House, we set up the strategy group to examine the implications of that.  We intend to accept the scientific advice for 2007.  We have received the report from the three people involved.  It will go to Government shortly and we will make decisions accordingly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The inland fisheries report was commissioned by Farrell Grant Sparks and following its completion, a year and a half elapsed before it was published.  Will there be a similar delay in the publication of this report?  In the case of the previous report, a situation similar to this one prevailed and the report was presented to Cabinet but it was not published for a further 18 months.  Is the Minister of State saying that by mid-November, which is a critical time for the putting forward of recommendations for 2007, that this report will be discussed by the Cabinet and a decision made on it recommendations?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1979"/>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>As an addendum to that question, the Minister of State seems to be dodging the question of the costings.  Will he and the Minister make any recommendations to the Minister for Finance arising from the report, given that they have accepted the advice of the standing scientific committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The three wise men, as they are known, were asked to deal with the financial implications, and they have done that.  Their recommendations or advice will go to Government and it will have to make a decision on any financial implications on foot of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister of State must await Cabinet approval before publishing the report and answering in respect of the financial implications involved or hardship schemes that may be put in place.  I imagine the report cannot but be published in the next month, because as the Minister of State said, there is a timeline in terms of the upcoming season.  This report will inevitably have to come out  within a matter of weeks and the Government will have to make a decision on it within a matter of weeks.  The Minister of State reiterated several times that the Government is standing by the advice of the standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission, which is welcome.  That committee&rsquo;s advice could not be clearer, namely, that we need to put an end to the mixed stock fishery and catching of wild salmon.  There will have to be an end to that mixed stock fishery.  The only question for the Cabinet to decide is what will be the consequential management in terms of hardship, the defining of mixed stock and so on.  Ultimately, the Government has agreed that the scientific advice is correct and we should move towards ending that mixed stock fishery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government and the House have agreed that we would get to the scientific figures by 2007.  We only received the report this week.  We will give it serious consideration, present it to the Government for its consideration and, depending on its consideration, we will have to act quickly.  I outlined the deadline dates within which we have to work.  As soon as the Government makes it decision, we will operate within that deadline.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a <Col N="1980"/>matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the independent regulator. </P>
        <P>One of my key priorities is to increase competition through the provision of broadband infrastructure so that consumers and businesses can benefit from better quality, competitive prices and increased choice.  Broadband prices have fallen consistently since 2003 and Ireland now ranks among the most price competitive in Europe with the third cheapest entry level ADSL for broadband in the EU-15 according to ComReg figures as at the end of June 2006.  A combination of competition and regulation is driving prices down, for example, DSL prices fell by approximately 25% during 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Minister referred to private sector companies but, unfortunately, the State has not become involved in this sector because of the selling off of Eircom.  </P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware of the report from the International Telecommunications Union?  It reinforced the point that Irish broadband subscribers fail to get value for money.  According to its report, Irish customers pay &euro;30 for a basic Eircom broadband package while customers in the Netherlands pay &euro;8 less and have a connection that is 20 times faster.  We are talking in terms our having the slowest broadband connection.  Does the Minister agree that we still lag behind most European countries in the uptake of broadband?  In that regard, is the Minister concerned about the slow roll-out of broadband, particularly in those regions where no major employer will invest unless basic infrastructure, such as broadband, is available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made no secret of my impatience and frustration at the slow commencement of a broadband roll-out throughout the country.  We were left behind in 2002.  There is no doubt about that and the Government recognised that fact at that stage.  It introduced the MANS programme, the schools broadband programme and the group broadband scheme to try to roll out and provide broadband in regional and provincial areas.  On the issue of the commencement of the roll-out of broadband, I have frequently said I am disappointed.  However, I am delighted to report that we have turned the corner on this issue.  I set a target just over two years ago when we had just over 56,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are last in the race.  We may be turning corners but we are still last.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We had 56,000 subscribers in Ireland at that stage and I set a target of 400,000 by the end of this year.  We had 410,000 subscribers as at September of this year and 17,000 <Col N="1981"/>new subscribers are coming on the system per month.  We have the fastest growing broadband increase of anywhere in Europe.  It looks as if we have turned the corner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have turned the corner all right.</P>

	<P>Into a cul-de-sac.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very welcome but as the Deputy pointed out, no matter how fast it is rolled out, there are still areas of the country that will not get broadband access unless the State intervenes.  The estimate varies but we are talking about approximately 10% to 15%  of the country without coverage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a lot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing a scheme that will enable us to resolve that difficulty.  I understand that Eircom is making an announcement today which will be helpful in facilitating a further roll-out of broadband with regard to enabling exchanges and so on.  After a very slow start, we are now accelerating.  Over the coming months we can reach even higher targets than those we have set.  I hope we will be able to devise a scheme that will provide for the area to which the Deputy referred, namely, the last 10% or 15%  of the country, to try to ensure there is coverage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What technology does the Minister propose to utilise to achieve coverage for the 10% or 15% to which he referred?  Will it be wireless, satellite or a combination of the two?  Will it include places like the Black Valley in County Kerry, which the Minister has been shyly skirting for the past few years, and areas in the midlands, with which the Minister would be much more familiar, that do not even have adequate traditional telephone services?  </P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned that we have turned the corner but we have been turning the corner for the past two years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dizzy from turning corners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have thought we would be on a straight road by now.  We have serious problems in this area and industry is suffering as a result of the slow delivery and high cost of broadband.  It is much more costly than has been suggested by the regulator and serious questions must be answered in that regard.  I ask the Minister to take a much more serious interest in what is going on, with a view to driving it ahead, regardless of what he is being told by way of statistics.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1982"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot help it if the statistics do not suit the Deputy.  I have taken this issue very seriously.  The statistics show that we are below the average cost in Europe for broadband.  If the statistics do not suit the Deputy, I cannot help that.  We are very well placed with regard to price because of the policies pursued with MANS, the group and school broadband schemes and the drive that I personally put into this to try to roll out broadband and encourage companies to roll it out to a significant extent.  </P>
        <P>The Deputy asked what technology will be used to provide broadband services to the last 10% or 15% of the country, that is, at the uneconomic exchanges.  The solution will have to be technology neutral.  The industry will have to participate in the process of arriving at a solution and the State will have to provide assistance.  There are areas where there is no exchange close enough to provide broadband services and there are other areas where, for a variety of reasons, one may have to use satellite or wireless technologies.  The solution will be a combination of all the technologies available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome today&rsquo;s announcement by Eircom that it is enabling 100 more exchanges.  However, that still leaves over 600 exchanges in rural Ireland with no chance of getting broadband.  The Minister has referred to the wireless option, which we all know is very expensive.  </P>
        <P>Is the Department talking directly to the new owners of Eircom, the Babcock and Brown team of Mr. Rex Comb and Mr. Pierre Dannon, about how we might enable the whole country?  Mr. Rex Comb said in an interview on 6 October in <i>The Irish Times</i> that he could not see how the company could commercially enable those outstanding rural and other exchanges that are in difficulty.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on the fact that 9.6% of lines are now broadband enabled and that we now have 410,000 subscribers.  However, Denmark has 29.3% of lines enabled, the Netherlands has 28.8%, Iceland has 27.3%, South Korea has 26.4% and so on.  In a recent report on the OECD nations, we were passed out by the Czechs.  It is only countries like Slovakia, Mexico and so on that are behind Ireland.</P>

	<P>I ask the Deputy to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Morgan asked a question about costs and, according to the figures I have in front of me, among EU and European countries only Luxembourg, Denmark and Iceland are more expensive for broadband than Ireland.  Broadband is very expensive, less than 10% of the population has access to it and it is still a bit of a disaster &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1983"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on Deputy Eamon Ryan to put his question to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is something that will probably haunt the Minister through the general election campaign when people reflect on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that while the numbers are growing significantly, Eircom still holds a massive advantage here in that it holds the last mile connection?  Most broadband is going through DSL and copper wire connections and the main companies have said to members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that the alternative methods, wireless and so forth, are not proving commercially attractive.  In those circumstances and in the absence of proper local loop unbundling, we do not have a competitive market.  We still have a very significant monopoly.  If one considers not only providing DSL broadband but also the next level in terms of voice over Internet broadband and telecommunications, merged services and a range of other new technologies that other countries are starting to roll out, we will still be playing catch-up because of that monopoly.  </P>
        <P>The Minister said that the solution for the last 10% to 15% of the country must be technology neutral and that the Government and the industry must be involved in finding that solution.  That can only mean that he is considering a State subsidy scheme for suppliers to provide broadband for isolated, rural, one-off houses or communities that are not currently acceptable to a network.  Is that what the Minister is discussing with the industry?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Broughan asked if I was talking directly to Eircom, Babcock &amp; Brown or the industry.  I am talking directly to everybody I can in the industry.  I addressed the TIF conference today and took the opportunity to speak to a number of other providers.  Every opportunity I get I speak to people on the issue.</P>
        <P>I have had a number of meetings with Mr. Rex Comb and Mr. Pierre Danone, including a courtesy meeting and a more business-oriented meeting.  I have not been talking to them directly with regard to the scheme.  The Department is currently finalising a proposal and will probably consult with TIF as a representative body.  It will then go to market in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister indicating the Government will enable those exchanges?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we will look for proposals to ensure that the last 10% to 15% of the country will be able to avail of broadband and there will be broadband coverage.  The Department will see what is the industry&rsquo;s response.</P><Col N="1984"/>
        <P>In reply to Deputy Eamon Ryan, despite my best efforts over the past two or three years in this area, we are not going to get the private commercial sector to fork out money to provide broadband on a nationwide basis out of any sense of national pride or interest.</P>
        <P>The companies all agree with the concept that it is in the national interest to have as much broadband coverage as possible, but they have indicated they will not pay for it.  If it is economical they will provide it, but they indicate that if the Government thinks it is in the national interest that broadband coverage is everywhere, the Government should contribute.  They will be looking for some support, State subsidy or backup.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Eamon Ryan&rsquo;s point, we are moving on the issue of voice-over IP etc.  That brings me back to the earlier point I made about the necessity to have as much fibre-optic cable as we can.  We must think now about next generation networks, which will be based on fibre-optics rather than copper.  This is particularly true if we want to get the reach and services we need.</P>
        <P>I have a point on figures and comparing like to like.  The worst possible set of statistics to use in comparing Ireland to other countries in Europe on broadband is household figures.  Population would be better from an Irish point of view.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for calling me on this important subject.</P>
        <P>There was a public protest in my constituency in Tallaght last Saturday, organised by the mayor of the county and the Labour Party, at which 4,000 people were present.  It is only an indicator of the scale of public concern in the greater Tallaght region about the implications of the Government decision on a new national children&rsquo;s hospital, and the apparent implication of it for the retention and development of paediatric services at Tallaght Hospital.  There are also implications arising from this decision on the downgrading of Tallaght Hospital itself.</P>
        <P>Somebody was quoted as saying &mdash; I believe it was Mayor Eamonn Moloney &mdash; that 30,000 children were treated at Tallaght Hospital last year and that was 30,000 good reasons for ensuring the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital continues at Tallaght.  There is no exaggerating the concern among parents and members of the public in the most densely populated area of the prospect of paediatric services being scaled down at Tallaght.</P>
        <P>The situation would appear to be that following the development of a new national children&rsquo;s hospital, we may get what is termed as an urgent care centre at Tallaght.  We do not know this because we cannot get clear answers from the Government.  Although we do not know this, we would expect that if urgent care centres mean anything, one is likely to go to Tallaght.</P>
        <P>From the perspective of the people of Tallaght, some of whom spent 20 years campaigning for the hospital at Tallaght, an urgent care centre is no more than a glorified clinic.  It certainly does not <Col N="1986"/>meet the needs of people in the area, where there are so many people at the family formation stage and where all the modern day arguments about traffic, congestion, accessibility, communications, etc, apply.</P>
        <P>The Government tends to indicate that the McKinsey consultants made this decision.  The Government made this decision.  The McKinsey consultants were brought in to advise on the ideal provision of paediatric services for a population of about 5 million.  They were expressly prevented in the terms of reference from having regard to the current configuration of services and from deciding on a site.  That was a Government decision.</P>
        <P>I see much merit in the recommendation put forward by Archbishop Eames.  It suggests that the best arrangement for Ireland is a single governance structure with two campuses, one northside and one southside at Tallaght.  That does not mean the complex tertiary requirements would all have to be done in both locations.  However, that would allow for the retention and development of paediatric services on a southside campus, in this case Tallaght, which would be accessible not just to the immensely populous region of the hinterland, but to people who travel from Cork, Mayo and Galway, etc.  It is as much a struggle to get from Portlaoise to Newlands Cross as it is to get from Newlands Cross to the Mater Hospital.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that we cannot get any clarity from Government.  The rather extraordinary procedures that were pursued in the making of this decision, and on which I have spoken on other occasions, have added to the concern and worry in my constituency.  In submitting its tender, in the short timeframe allowed, the board of Tallaght Hospital drew attention to the nine McKinsey criteria, which included space, services, co-location, access, efficiency, people, teaching and research, financial stability and full project plan.  They concluded that no other location met those nine requirements as well as Tallaght Hospital, and that conclusion has never been challenged.  It has co-location with a major teaching hospital, ample space on the campus and offers the required services with a proven track record of expertise.  It is accessible from all parts of the country, is efficient and has the necessary staff.</P>
        <P>We do not know what the future holds for Tallaght Hospital.  It is the conviction of the leadership of the hospital that if, as seems to be the import of the Government decision, all paediatric and tertiary services are transferred out of Tallaght and Crumlin to the Mater Hospital, it will not just be a blow to parents looking for services for their sick children but will impact on the stature of Tallaght Hospital itself, downgrading it when we should be planning for its continued development with the provision of <Col N="1987"/>maternity services and the retention and development of the paediatric services that are currently offered.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to throw some light on the Government decision during this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise precisely the same issue as my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte.  Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter in the Seanad, with particular reference to the method used to select the tertiary hospital.  That certainly needs explaining because, in terms of accessibility alone, it is difficult to think of anywhere less accessible than the Mater Hospital.</P>
        <P>My concern is over the decision that the tertiary hospital, wherever it is located, is to be the only hospital providing paediatric services to children in Dublin.  It makes absolutely no sense to run down or eliminate existing services which work very well and with which the public is absolutely satisfied.  Many of us have known the writing has been on the wall for Crumlin Hospital for a long time, because it is a single specialty hospital, but it makes no sense to also run down and eliminate the services in the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Tallaght, leaving most of the children in the Dublin region with access to only one hospital where they will have to go even for ordinary paediatric services for the most common illnesses, rather than complex, tertiary services.  Most childhood admissions to hospitals are for ordinary illnesses, often overnight.  The idea of blocking expensive beds in a tertiary hospital for that kind of use is absolute nonsense and cannot be justified on expense grounds alone.  Those beds will be so limited that Dublin children will not have access to hospital beds in the way the rest of the country might.</P>
        <P>Parents understand that everybody cannot have a local hospital but do not understand how the rest of the country can have the services of a secondary hospital for the more common illnesses in addition to a tertiary hospital, while Dublin parents will only have access to the limited beds available in the national tertiary hospital.</P>
        <P>I fully support the concept of having specialist services in one national tertiary hospital.  To remove from a large swathe of the population vital, accessible children&rsquo;s services, and to abandon all the expertise and experience that has been painstakingly built up in the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Tallaght, over the years is economic, demographic and medical folly.</P>
        <P>I do not know which bright spark decided that, uniquely for children in Dublin, the national tertiary hospital should also be their local hospital.  Why is this arrangement being made for children but not for adults?  Tertiary hospitals are required for all specialties but no one suggests we close all the adult hospitals in Dublin to provide the critical mass necessary to provide a tertiary service to <Col N="1988"/>the rest of the country.  If anybody suggested the closure of five of the six major Dublin hospitals they would be laughed off the stage so why are we suggesting it for children?  Just under 40% of the population live in the greater Dublin area.  What on earth made anybody think one tertiary hospital would meet all the paediatric needs of the Dublin area?</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to heed what we say.  I am not an alarmist but this is absolute nonsense.  It is dangerous nonsense and has to be stopped.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank both Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Rabbitte.  I see that Deputy O&rsquo;Connor is also present and has an interest in the issue.  I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>In late 2005, the Health Service Executive, HSE, at the Minister&rsquo;s request, undertook a review of tertiary paediatric services.  McKinsey and Company were engaged by the HSE and its report, which was presented to the HSE in February, included a number of key recommendations, namely, the population and projected demands in this country can support only one world-class tertiary paediatric hospital; the hospital should be in Dublin, and should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, that is, it should be within a practical walking distance of such a hospital; and the hospital should also provide all the secondary, that is, less complex, hospital needs of children in the greater Dublin area and these secondary services should be supported by strategically located urgent care centres.  The HSE welcomed the report as providing a clear outline of how to provide the best hospital care for children throughout the country, in line with best practice.</P>
        <P>It is worthwhile at this point to explain why the principle of co-location of the paediatric hospital with the adult hospital is so important.  The McKinsey report emphasised that best outcomes for children are critically dependent on having breadth and depth in sub-specialist services, that is, a critical mass.  To achieve such a critical mass, it is considered that tertiary centres should serve a population which is large enough to support a full complement of paediatric sub-specialists, co-located with an adult teaching hospital.  The collaboration of adult and paediatric specialists creates a larger critical mass of specialists in a particular area, which in turn creates the platform for improved outcomes.</P>
        <P>Arising from the McKinsey report, a joint HSE and Department of Health and Children task group was established to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.  Each of the six major adult academic hospitals in Dublin, including Tallaght Hospital, made a detailed submission to the task group.  The task group con<Col N="1989"/>cluded that each of the sites adequately demonstrated the feasibility of accommodating the proposed new paediatric hospital and a new maternity hospital.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">However, the task group considered that three of the hospitals, the Connolly Hospital, St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, did not offer the necessary breadth and depth of tertiary services to complement the paediatric hospital and on this ground those three sites were ruled out as co-location options.  Following assessment of the remaining sites, the group concluded that Beaumont Hospital was significantly less suitable, in terms of ease of access, than either the Mater Hospital or St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, particularly for the children of the greater Dublin area who will use the hospital for all of their hospital care.  The task group found that both the Mater Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital demonstrated their ability to meet all of the assessment criteria set by the group and, on the basis of these criteria, it was not possible for the group to recommend one location on a basis that rendered it clearly distinguishable from the other.  The group decided the selected location would have to develop clear cross-site, team-working arrangements with the corresponding adult specialist teams based at the other adult hospitals.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>In the context of the current configuration of adult specialties, the group considered the Mater Hospital to be in a better geographical position than St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to facilitate a clinical network of critical adult and paediatric specialties.  Accordingly, the task group recommended that the new national tertiary paediatric hospital should be built on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  The board of the HSE and the Government endorsed the task group&rsquo;s report and its recommendations.  The Government mandated the HSE to move forward with the development of the new hospital and its associated urgent care centres, and to explore any philanthropic proposals connected with its development.  The governance arrangements that will arise in the context of the amalgamation of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals will also be pursued, in particular the measures needed to ensure the new hospital is multi-denominational and pluralist in character.</P>
        <P>The Minister is fully satisfied that the task group undertook a rigorous and robust examination of the key issues in making its recommendation.  The task group consulted widely in arriving at its recommendations, and gave detailed consideration to the key issues of access, governance, clinical values and site suitability.  Each of the three existing paediatric hospitals expressed strong support for the development of a single paediatric hospital, and emphasised the need for decisions on the new hospital to be taken urgently.  Paediatric consultant representatives <Col N="1990"/>expressed their willingness to move to the new hospital regardless of its location.</P>
        <P>A joint HSE-Department of Health and Children transition group has since been established to advance the development of the new hospital.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new hospital and the determination of the range of services and location of the associated urgent care centres required to support it.  The group will have consultations with relevant stakeholders, which will include representatives of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght.  To date, no decision has been taken on the range of services to be provided at the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght in the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and the associated urgent care centres.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister and the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive met with representatives of the Adelaide Hospital Society, including Archbishop Eames, in June to discuss issues relating to Tallaght Hospital.  The hospital representatives expressed concern at the implications for the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght of the Government decision to endorse the development of a single national tertiary paediatric hospital at the Mater Hospital.  They also discussed several other matters relating to the provision of hospital services at Tallaght.  Development proposals submitted by the delegation, which have significant resource implications, have been forwarded to the Health Service Executive for consideration.</P>
        <P>In a letter to Archbishop Eames following the meeting, the Taoiseach gave an assurance that the Government wishes the hospital to thrive on a sustainable basis as a focal point for the involvement of the minority tradition in the healthcare system and as a key health provider to an expanding local population.  These objectives will be pursued in tandem with other compelling objectives, including the achievement of an effective and efficient hospital care system, which will deliver the highest possible standards of care within a framework designed to respond to the needs of patients at national, regional and local level.  Arising from the meeting, it has also been decided that a review will be conducted of decisions taken with regard to the funding and development of the hospital.  The arrangements for this review are being finalised.</P>

      <sTitle>Job Losses.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday&rsquo;s confirmation that approximately 450 jobs are to be lost at Cadbury over three years is a shocking hammer blow for Coolock and Dublin&rsquo;s north side.  Of the 1,500 member workforce at Cadbury, workers in Rathmore, County Kerry, and in Tallaght in west Dublin, will be affected but as 1,100 workers are <Col N="1991"/>based in the Coolock plant the most serious impact will be felt there.</P>
        <P>My first thoughts are with those workers and their families who face the prospect of being made redundant over the coming months and years.  This will be particularly difficult for many of the senior men and women who have worked at the factory for decades.  These job losses will deeply affect Coolock district and its environs where in some areas there is up to 20% and 25% unemployment, despite the Celtic tiger.  Cadbury has a decades-long connection with Coolock since its arrival in Ireland in 1932 and the factory on Oscar Traynor Road is a famous local landmark, providing work for generations of people.</P>
        <P>People were always interested in working for Cadbury with intense competition for jobs as the company provided good wages and working conditions.  Cadbury executives also supported employment initiatives undertaken by the Coolock Development Council, of which I was the first chairman in the mid-1980s, the Northside Partnership and the Northside Centre for the Unemployed.  Their assistance was very important in the early days of those organisations and from that point of view too yesterday was a sad day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cadbury management has said it intends to undertake a change programme which will involve the investment of &euro;100 million over the next three years and that it has invested &euro;80 million since 1999 to restore competitiveness.  I hope it follows through with this and new technology and that the remaining 700 or 800 jobs will be secure.  This hammer blow to our region comes on top of a steady haemorrhaging of jobs from the local industrial estates, particularly Clonshaugh Industrial and Business Park which has lost dozens of IT companies to eastern Europe and Asia over the past seven years.  These include flagship companies such as Gateway 2000 and Data Products, and Saronix and Terradata.  Most of these businesses have not been replaced and their factories are lying empty.  Over a year ago, when Tayto closed its famous north side factory with a loss of 98 jobs, I raised the issue of the failure of the IDA to attract jobs to the north side and urged Sean Dorgan urgently to change the IDA policy of directing jobs away from Dublin&rsquo;s north side.  There is a need for less skilled jobs to be aimed at areas of high unemployment.  So far that message does not seem to have got through to either Mr. Dorgan or the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
        <P>The disgraceful rise in energy costs of well over 100% in gas prices for example and 60% to 70% in electricity during the lifetime of this Government has put a significant strain on business.  The organisation for small and medium enterprises, ISME, describes the rising cost of energy as the <Col N="1992"/>&ldquo;number one enemy&rdquo; for business in this country.  The Irish Exporters Association referred to &ldquo;the unacceptably high increases in the cost of energy supply&rdquo; which the Government needs to address urgently.  IBEC has stated that perhaps 120 companies with over 52,000 workers are directly in danger of major pressures and downsizing, or even closure and liquidation, due to escalating energy costs.</P>
        <P>Yesterday was a sad and regrettable day for Coolock and for the whole northside region.  It is time for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to come forward with a strategy for our region to address competitiveness and energy costs and to implement it quickly.  The organisations to which I referred earlier, in particular Northside Partnership, its chief executive officer, Ms Marion Vickers and chairperson, Mr. Willie Hamilton and their staff, the Northside Centre for the Unemployed and Coolock Development Council will be willing to liaise closely with Cadbury&rsquo;s management in respect of any retraining and reinstatement of workers affected by this restructuring programme.  I urge the Government and Government Deputies to give the strongest possible financial and other assistance to the local organisations to enable them to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the 1930s Cadbury has been a pivotal employer in the Coolock area and north-east Dublin.  It has served the area well both in good and bad times.  It was seen to be a privilege to work there.  Cadbury is an institution in that part of Dublin, as well as one of the best known brand names in the country.  In many cases, three generations of families have worked at the factory which employs 1,400 people.</P>
        <P>From time to time, companies must modernise, streamline and restructure their operations.  Like Deputy Broughan, when I first heard the news of the job losses, I was aghast at the swiftness of the decision.  In a letter I received from the chairman of Cadbury yesterday, I was informed the 450 job losses will be on a phased basis over three years, hopefully on a voluntary basis.  I contacted the office of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and was assured the full details of the Cadbury package will be made known.  As a former trade union official with the Communication Workers Union, I was involved in working out voluntary redundancies and early retirement schemes, and it is not as bad as some may believe.</P>
        <P>The Minister assured me he will meet the unions, the workers and management of Cadbury.  With an announcement like yesterday&rsquo;s, an unsettled atmosphere can be created among the staff who remain.  People often ask who will be next to be laid off.  I want to know what is planned for the next 15 years in Cadbury.  I understand the company must streamline to be <Col N="1993"/>competitive to ensure it can give good employment in Coolock.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recall when more than 60 people were laid off from a plastics factory in Coolock.  F&Aacute;S retrained many of these workers and redeployed them in employment in their own area.  I hope the same can be done for those affected in Cadbury.  Cadbury must consult the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the employment agencies to ensure the workers are well informed of their options before the job losses come into effect.  The Minister has informed me consultations will take place to reassure those not affected of their continued employment at the plant.  As a former trade union official, I joined Fianna F&aacute;il because I believe it is the party that protects the workers and will continue to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, returns from abroad, he will meet Deputies Broughan and Martin Brady to discuss this issue.  Both the Minister and Enterprise Ireland were aware for some time that the company was carrying out a strategic review of its operation in Coolock.  It was only completed recently.  During the course of the review, the company chairman, CEO of Enterprise Ireland and senior management from both organisations have been in discussions.</P>
        <P>The Coolock facility is one of 11 similar facilities Cadbury has in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Concern was expressed at the high level of operating costs at the Coolock plant and it was decided its current business model was unsustainable.  Cadbury was faced with either the full closure of the operation in Coolock or to streamline and increase efficiencies.  The latter option will require a reduction of 400 to 450 jobs on a voluntary basis over the next three years.  Management and the unions will discuss the best way to achieve this.  I am heartened by the commitment given by the company to the long-term future of the Coolock plant.</P>
        <P>The Government is conscious of the effects the job losses will have on the workers involved, their families and their community.  It is distressing news for those who will lose their jobs.  The relevant State agencies will provide every support they can.  The priority will be to find alternative employment for those involved at the earliest opportunity.  The role of F&Aacute;S will be of particular importance in providing support and assistance to the workers concerned.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is abroad on official business, has been following the case.  Enterprise Ireland has been working closely with the company for some time.</P>
        <P>There is a significant churn in employment.  Traditional low-cost industries are under pressure and are closing, while other industries, especially the service industry, are providing much employment.  In the past six years, more than 440,000 <Col N="1994"/>jobs were created in services and 150,000 jobs in high-end manufacturing, a significant turnaround in the nature of employment.  Long-term, sustainable economic growth and expansion in employment depends on a competitive and adaptable economy.  The effects of globalisation are felt in even the smallest markets and global competition will intensify and extend its reach.  The Government has recognised the inevitable changes taking place across world markets for both trade and investment.  Enterprise policies that equip companies with the ability to better compete in world markets, capture the opportunities from globalisation and build competitive advantage in innovation and knowledge have been central to policy development.</P>
        <P>The impact of globalisation on Ireland has to be put in perspective.  In the past eight years more than 523,000 people have been added to our workforce, an unprecedented growth of 35%, with more than 2 million people in employment.  Job relocations, which inevitably arise in the globalised marketplace, are far exceeded by new job creation, usually accompanied by better paid high skilled employment.  Furthermore, unemployment continues to fall.</P>
        <P>The best response to globalisation is to ensure Ireland remains attractive for investment and enterprise growth.  As the economy has matured, foreign direct investment incentives have been tailored to match our strengths.  Low wage costs are no longer an enticement but have been replaced by other attractions.  These include a benign tax and regulatory environment, a better educated workforce, an improving infrastructure and a commitment to world-class standards of research, development and innovation.  Maintaining and improving upon these standards is vital to sustaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The IMD world competitiveness scoreboard ranked Ireland as the world&rsquo;s 11th most competitive economy in 2006, up one place on last year&rsquo;s position.  The agencies under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are working to maintain Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness to foreign investment while assisting indigenous industry.  In 2005, the IDA supported more than 50 research and development projects related to business investment to the value of more than &euro;275 million, a record both in number and value for the agency.  Enterprise Ireland has introduced a productivity improvement fund for indigenous enterprises to improve levels of productivity through technology acquisition or labour force training.  In 2005, Enterprise Ireland helped 515 client companies invest more than &euro;100,000 each in meaningful research and development, with 33 companies investing more than &euro;2 million.  With this and other assistance, Enterprise Ireland is making significant progress in helping Irish enterprises to improve their export performance, <Col N="1995"/>with growth of 7% in 2005 and 15% in exports to Asia.</P>
        <P>Dublin has been a success story in terms of foreign direct investment, FDI, with a critical mass of population, skills pool, educational infrastructure, international access connections, existing business activity across all sectors and extensive property solutions for future activity.  New company arrivals in 2005 included Google, eBay, Kellogg and QLogic and, in 2006, SanDisk, Actel and Sage.</P>
        <P>The Government strategy for Dublin is to progress the development of a knowledge economy so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment; work with the existing client base in Dublin to encourage it to expand and diversify into higher value added goods and services; act as a broker with the higher education authorities, key client companies and Science Foundation Ireland to encourage further research and development; <Col N="1996"/>provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure; and work with local authorities and other relevant agencies to influence the delivery of the necessary infrastructure in the county.</P>
        <P>In 2005, there were 474 IDA companies in Dublin employing 48,178 people.  The capital has traditionally been a centre for manufacturing industry for FDI.  In recent years, however, there has been a shift away from manufacturing, due to cost competitiveness, to more knowledge-based higher value-added projects in fund management, e-commerce, software and high-end back office services.  I assure the Deputies that the industrial development agencies will continue to promote north Dublin in order to create sustainable investment and job opportunities in the future.</P>
        <P>I again apologise for the absence of the Minister.  His officials have assured me he will meet both Deputies to discuss the matter further as soon as he returns.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 12 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is firmly committed to the development of an Irish biofuels market and to the increased development of bio-energy generally in Ireland. A range of initiatives are in place to support the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland. The 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief for a two year period under the scheme including four pure plant oil, three biodiesel or other biofuel and one bioethanol proposal.</P>
        <P>Building on the success of this scheme I launched the Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme II, valued at over &euro;200m, in July 2006. The new excise relief programme, which is subject to State-aid approval, will provide a framework where farmers and potential developers can consider all such options. The scheme will be rolled out this year and will enable us to reach the initial target of 2% market penetration of bio<Col N="1998"/>fuels by 2008. When fully operational the relief is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year. Applications received under the scheme are currently being assessed by an assessment panel established by my Department.</P>
        <P>One of the aims of the new scheme is to stimulate the development of biomass/feedstock production in Ireland to support a sustainable domestic biofuels industry. There are considerable benefits to be accrued from a cohesive approach to bio energy and biofuels for both the demand and supply sides. Indeed such an approach is crucial. The Government has mandated all relevant Departments and Agencies to work collectively to best effect on the national bio-energy agenda.</P>
        <P>I launched a Ministerial Bio Energy Task Force in July 2006. The primary objective of the Task Force is to draw up a cohesive national bio-energy strategy by the end of the year, which will set targets for deployment of bio-energy, identify priority areas for development and the necessary support measures to encourage supply and demand in a planned way. This strategy will also take account of EU developments, and the views of key stakeholders under the Energy Policy Green Paper consultation process.</P>
        <P>The Task Force will consider whether continued excise relief programmes, or other measures such as a biofuels &ldquo;obligation&rdquo;, whereby fuel suppliers are obliged to place a certain proportion of biofuels on the market per annum, would be appropriate. Such considerations will be developed in tandem with EU developments. The Commission is currently undertaking a review of the Biofuels Directive and has placed increasing emphasis on bio-energy since the publication of its Biomass Action Plan in December 2005.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 80 together.</P>
        <P>In June 2004 further to a competitive, public tender process, E-Net was awarded the contract to manage, maintain, market and operate the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) for a period of 15 years. E-Net is an independent company based in Limerick established solely for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Under Phase 1 of the MANs programme, twenty-seven networks were completed and handed over to E-Net. E-Net have concluded contracts with various Service Providers and activity has begun on the networks. The details of these contracts are commercially sensitive and are a matter for E-Net. The number of broadband connections provided by Service Providers to their customers is commercially sensitive and not available to E-Net or the Department. Twenty-five of the twenty-seven networks have been lit to date. Uptake on the MANs is increasing on a monthly basis.</P>
        <P>E-Net&rsquo;s contractual obligations for the management, operation, marketing and maintenance of the MANs are set out in the Concession Agreement between my Department and E-Net. Controls exist within the Concession Agreement to closely monitor E-Net&rsquo;s performance. E-Net formally reports to my Department on a quarterly basis and is obliged to file various documents throughout the contract term dealing with its activities. E-Net also publishes an annual set of accounts. Arrangements are in place to ensure that E-Net are fulfilling their obligations, under the Concession Agreement.</P>
        <P>Although E-Net is still in the start up phase of operation, it is experiencing continued growth in revenues in line with its forecast. E-Net has established a working relationship with every major telecom operator in the State with the exception of the incumbent. The range and variety of wholesale services offered to operators has continued to expand.</P><Col N="2000"/>
        <P>My Department is continuously examining the regional interconnectivity issue. It is recognised there are obstacles in ensuring that customers in regional towns can gain access to quality broadband services at competitive prices. The newly constructed MANs ensure that there is now significant capacity available in the urban areas of these towns. However, there is still limited national competition on backhaul, i.e. the onward transportation of this traffic to other destinations and to the international internet exchanges in Dublin. I am exploring options to facilitate competition amongst the various regional backhaul providers.</P>
        <P>In relation to Project Dingle a team of advisors was engaged in April 2005 to examine the potential for enhancing and augmenting existing state owned infrastructure. They submitted a Feasibility Report last December setting out the available options. The team reported that, while technically feasible, there would be considerable financial, legal and management challenges in harnessing and enhancing the existing state owned infrastructures.</P>

        <Quest> if he is satisfied that all health and safety requirements applicable to the Corrib gas field have been complied with or are in due course to do so; when he expects product to be available in view of the urgent needs of the industrial and domestic sector and the economy generally; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a range of requirements that apply to infrastructure projects like the Corrib Gas Project.  As a consequence of both the independent Safety Review process, carried out for my Department by Advantica, and of the Cassells Report into the difficulties surrounding the project, a series of additional requirements have been made of the developer.</P>
        <P>The Advantica report found that proper consideration to safety had been given in the selection process for the project as a whole. Moreover, the review found that so long as a number of measures were implemented, the project would carry a substantial safety margin and that both the pipeline and route should be accepted as meeting or exceeding international best practice. The Technical Advisory Group (TAG), which supervised the safety review, made further recommendations.</P>
        <P>I published the full details of all these recommendations in May of this year, and the developer has committed itself to meet these in full. No further consents will be granted by me until TAG, and I, are satisfied that these requirements will be met.</P><Col N="2001"/>

	<P>Post office closures and conversions are, in the first instance, an operational matter for the Board and management of An Post and one in which I have no function.  I would refer the Deputy to the following appendix, which details the number and location of post offices closed and converted to date, in 2006.</P>
        <P>As clearly set out in the Programme for Government, this Government and the Board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing and maintaining the largest, economically sustainable post office network possible.</P>
        <P>The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size. In this regard the way forward is for An Post to enhance existing services and building on existing strengths, to develop new product offerings.</P>
        <P>It was in recognition of this fact that one of the first actions I undertook on taking up office was to ask the company to devise a new long-term strategy for the post office network. Last month Government approval was secured for An Post to enter a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis to set up a retail banking business.</P>
        <P>Key to the Government approval of the joint venture is that it offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network as well as improving income streams for the network and its postmasters.</P>

	<P>Issues in relation to postmasters employed by An Post are, in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function. Despite this I have met with the IPU on a number of occasions and addressed their Annual Conference.</P>
        <P>The Government has been and continues to be committed to the objective of securing and maintaining the largest economically sustainable post office network possible. This extends to the postmasters whose financial security and strong relationship with customers are vital to the continued viability of the network.</P>
        <P>It was with this in mind that I appointed Mr. Eamonn Ryan to act as facilitator between the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union and An Post to identify issues of mutual concern and plot a roadmap for their resolution. In this regard, Mr. Ryan recently completed a report on these issues and made a number of recommendations. I understand that his report is now the subject of ongoing discussions between the IPU and An Post.</P>
        <P>Whilst acknowledging the relative importance of the current Government contracts to the network, the way forward for the post office is to win new business and new income streams, particularly in the case of postmasters.</P>
        <P>It was in recognition of this fact that one of the first actions I undertook on taking up office was to ask the company to devise a new long-term strategy for the post office network.

        <P>Key to the Government approval of this joint venture was that it not only offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network but that it will, in time, greatly benefit the income streams of postmasters.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year, I launched a new ocean energy strategy, which aims to put Ireland at the forefront of ocean energy development and position us to capitalise on this resource. The strategy was developed by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>As the first stage in implementing this strategy, we have recently upgraded the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre in UCC as well as opening an ocean energy test site a mile and a half off the coast of Spiddal, Co Galway. SEI and the Marine Institute are also currently supporting a number of other ocean energy research and development initiatives.</P>
        <P>The second phase of the strategy will see the development of pre-commercial grid connected devices and provide for a grid connection to a suitable test site. This phase is expected to be <Col N="2004"/>activated in the period 2008 to 2010, pending the outcome of the tests in phase one.</P>
        <P>Phase three of the Strategy, which is envisaged for 2011 to 2015, involves supporting a 10MW array of devices which would be connected to the grid.</P>
        <P>Clearly the pace of technological development will have an impact on the dates for implementation of the strategy. This is an area that I will be requesting the Energy Research Council to examine, with a view to accelerating RD&amp;D work in this developing and promising area.</P>
        <P>Ireland has one of the most promising ocean energy resources in the world, and the Government aims to position Ireland to take full advantage of this resource in the future. The structural and phased development strategy should enable Ireland to utilise its ocean energy resource within a decade.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans, at this stage, to introduce a Post and Postal Services Bill before the general election.  With respect to strategies for the development of An Post, that is a matter, in the first instance for the board and management of the company.</P>
        <P>My officials and I have met with the new chief executive of An Post since his appointment earlier this year. The company has made a commitment to prepare a comprehensive strategy review to be submitted to me within the next few months.</P>
        <P>It is important that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network and should take into account the challenges of the future liberalisation of the postal sector.</P>
        <P>The Government recently approved the company strategy for the creation of a financial services strategy with Belgian bank, Fortis. If successful, this venture could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.</P>
        <P>As regards the challenge presented by competition, liberalisation of the sector, as set out in two European Union postal directives, has already commenced in Ireland with some sectors such as outbound international mail already fully subject to competition. An Post, like all other postal operators will face more intense competition upon full opening of the market, which the European Directives propose to happen, subject to political approval, on 1 January 2009.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Commission recently completed a draft amendment to the current postal directive and that this is to be submitted to Parliament and Council for ratification. This proposal, I understand, confirms 1 January 2009 as the date for full market opening of the postal sector across the EU. Any ratified Directive will be subject to Oireachtas scrutiny and will be required to be transposed into Irish Law.</P>
        <P>Therefore, in terms of dealing with the challenges facing An Post in the coming years, the restructuring plan between unions and management, agreed earlier this year, will play an important part in the process of placing An Post on a more secure financial footing. It is imperative that all sides continue to work together to ensure that the plan is fully implemented.</P>

        <P>Following reporting by the United Kingdom authorities to the EU Commission of undeclared landings of mackerel by Irish vessels into Scotland in 2005, the EU Commission deducted 6,578 tonnes from Ireland&rsquo;s 2006 mackerel quota under Commission Regulation 742/2006. Following extensive consultations and having considered all the issues involved and options available in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy, I decided that deductions will be applied to the allocations of those vessel owners in respect of whom I am satisfied, following full consideration of representations made to me by the vessels owners identified, have breached Community regulations and landed undeclared mackerel.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing with the EU Commission in relation to the methodology, scaling and timing of deductions in respect of undeclared landings in the period 2001-2004 as indicated as a result of the UK investigations. The matter of addressing any reductions to Ireland&rsquo;s future mackerel quota to address the reported undeclared illegal landings in the period 2001-2004 will fall for consideration at a future date.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for <Col N="2009"/>the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband. My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity. The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above.</P>
        <P>For rural communities with populations under 1,500 and the hinterlands of larger towns, my Department offers funding under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) to enable them to become self-sufficient in broadband, in association with service providers. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 160 projects have been approved for funding under this Programme.</P>
        <P>A joint industry/Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the Broadband for Schools Programme to resource the provision of high speed broadband connectivity to all primary and post primary schools in the country by end Autumn 2006, at no cost to the schools themselves. 95% of schools have broadband installed to date; the aim is to complete the outstanding schools as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Despite Government investment in broadband in the regions through the regional broadband programme, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Options to address the gaps in broadband coverage are currently being considered.</P>
        <P>29% of Irish households now have broadband (410,000 of 1.4 million). Broadband take-up in Ireland grew by 112% during the first 8.5 months of 2006 when 140,000 subscribers were added.</P>
        <P>Broadband take-up is continuing to accelerate at a rate of 19% compared to the average EU growth rate of 9%. When discussing Ireland&rsquo;s ranking in the &lsquo;take-up&rsquo; league tables, there are two important points to note: Firstly, the statistics used are based on the number of subscribing households per 100 inhabitants. Households and population are used because such data is generally available for the countries participating in the league tables. However, in Ireland&rsquo;s case, the 10.2% &ldquo;subscribers&rdquo; per 100 &ldquo;inhabitants&rdquo; does not paint an accurate picture. Ireland&rsquo;s relatively <Col N="2010"/>small number of households for the size of our population puts Ireland at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to the league tables. It is more accurate to highlight the fact that 29% of Irish households subscribed to a broadband service in September 2006. The last available data for the EU15 (December 2005) show that 34% of the EU15 households had broadband.</P>
        <P>Secondly Ireland&rsquo;s ranking also reflects the relatively late launch of affordable and competitive broadband services in Ireland by telecoms and cable TV companies in the early 2000s. In contrast, Ireland is now one of the fastest growing broadband markets in the European Union. In fact, broadband take-up has more than tripled<?oasys _jy ?>to date since I set a target of 400,000 in late<?oasys _jy ?>2004.</P>

	<P>In 2005 the &ldquo;average&rdquo; dwelling was responsible for emitting approximately 8.7 tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>. This represents a reduction in the emissions of energy-related CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> per dwelling decreased by 19% over the period 1990 to 2005.  Sustainable Energy Ireland administers a number of incentive schemes directed at different aspects of the home energy market. Activities and achievements to date are summarised as follows.  The House of Tomorrow Programme stimulates the widespread uptake of more sustainable energy planning, design, specification and construction practices in both the new home building and the home improvement markets.</P>
        <P>The House of Tomorrow Programme funds demonstration projects to create a nationwide network of accessible, replicable model examples of more sustainable energy practices in Irish housing. Funding of up to &euro;8,000 per unit is available to developers for clusters of homes where the energy consumption and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions are at least 40% below what would apply under current Building Regulations. To date over 90 projects comprising over 4,000 homes have been supported.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of the Home Energy Rating programme is to prepare for and enable the successful implementation of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) in Ireland. A key element is to address the need for a comprehensive, nationally recognised building energy rating system aimed at making energy efficiency an explicit factor in building transactions and renovation decisions.</P><Col N="2011"/>
        <P>SEI&rsquo;s Low-Income Housing Programme (LIH) targets those homes that experience fuel poverty. Low-income householders are unable to afford the capital investment measures that would improve the energy quality of their homes. SEI&rsquo;s LIH Programme was set up to help establish and implement a national plan of action to address this problem systematically. Core delivery is through its Warmer Homes Scheme aimed at improving the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of affected homes, utilising existing networks of community-based organisations. To date, over 9,800 homes have had a range of energy efficiency measures implemented including attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, energy efficient lamps and in some instances wall insulation.</P>
        <P>The &euro;27m &ldquo;Greener Homes&rdquo; domestic renewable heat grants programme, which was launched in March this year, is providing grants for householders for the purpose of installing renewable heating including wood biomass boilers and stoves, solar panels and heat pumps.</P>
        <P>In the 26-week period up to 25 September 2006 since the Greener Homes Scheme was launched, a total of 7,716 applications have been received for grant aid and of these 6,842 offers of grant aid have issued.</P>

	<P>To date, 19 Departmental staff have so far decentralised to Cavan, and 25 staff to Clonakilty. In addition, 15 of my Department&rsquo;s staff have left to join other Departments with a view to decentralising elsewhere under the Decentralisation Programme. Based on current figures, approximately 361 of my Department&rsquo;s Dublin based staff have indicated that they do not wish to relocate to Cavan or Clonakilty.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation policy acknowledges the ongoing requirement for Dublin based civil servants.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to transfer all of the non-Marine functions of my Department to Cavan in 2009. However, we do already have a small advance <Col N="2012"/>presence in Cavan and the following Departmental functions are now based there:</P>

All of the Department&rsquo;s existing marine and fishery functions are due to be located in Clonakilty by summer 2007 including the proposed new Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  The costs associated with the decentralisation programme are a matter for the OPW and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>The loss of expertise and experience through staff opting to remain in Dublin or transferring to other Departments will be safeguarded through a combination of staff overlaps, investment in training and the introduction of a comprehensive knowledge management programme within the Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 61 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to developing domestic scale renewable electricity and heat technologies. Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has undertaken work on Metering Options for Small Scale Renewable and CHP Electricity Generation. The study identified a number of areas which require further analysis including the ability of such processes to secure adequate payment for their exports, a review of connection standards and processes for smaller generators, and the implications of the Single Electricity Market for small-scale electricity generation.</P>
        <P>These technical and administrative issues are currently being addressed, and my Department is working with the relevant agencies, including SEI, the Commission for Energy Regulation <Col N="2013"/>(CER), ESB Networks and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland in this regard.</P>
        <P>As part of the ongoing work to progress this area, CER has recently launched a public consultation on micro generation.</P>
        <P>We are working to ensure that the appropriate administrative, technical and safety standards and practices are in place to underpin programmes for the widespread deployment of micro generation technologies. I am confident that appropriate solutions suited to the context of the Irish electricity grid and for non-grid connected technologies will be developed with a view to progressing this emerging sector.</P>

	<P>The EU regulatory framework for both energy and telecoms is in place for the benefit of consumers and the economy.  The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is responsible for the regulation of the telecoms industry in accordance with the EU regulatory framework transposed in 2003 and the Communications Regulation Act of 2002. One of ComReg&rsquo;s key objectives is to promote the interests of users.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is required under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002 and relevant subsequent regulations, to exercise its functions in a manner that protects the interests of final customers of electricity and natural gas and also to promote competition in the supply of electricity and natural gas. The Green Paper &ldquo;Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland&rdquo; recently published by my Department has opened up the debate on the shape of policy directions for the future. In particular it poses questions as to what actions should be taken domestically to reduce the cost of electricity and gas to consumers and to reduce fuel poverty. I am looking forward to an imaginative debate on these issues, which will no doubt inform policy in this regard going forward.</P>
        <P>I am in regular contact with the regulators for the sectors under my remit and other key stakeholders. Any proposals to address concerns that may arise in these areas will be given my full consideration, and I will not hesitate to bring forward legislative changes if appropriate.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 76 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland is one of the few developed countries that does not have a postcode. As regards An Post&rsquo;s current coding system, it has characteristics that impact upon its suitability for use as a public postcode system and it is not consistent with the generally accepted definition of a postcode as a &ldquo;unique, universal identifier that unambiguously <Col N="2015"/>identifies the addressee&rsquo;s locality and assists in the transmission and sorting of mail items.&rdquo; An Post has also advised that it is not a publicly available postcode system.</P>
        <P>In order to examine the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland, I established a Working Group, which published its report last year.</P>
        <P>Following from the group&rsquo;s report, I asked the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) to appoint consultants with the specialist expertise to provide technical and economic advice including assessing the costs and benefits of the introduction of a postcode. ComReg appointed both technical and economic consultants. I appointed a National Postcode Project Board, comprising representatives of Government Departments, together with public and private sector organisations to oversee the work and output of the consultants.</P>
        <P>One constituent part of the consultants&rsquo; work programmes was that they were to engage in a process of stakeholder consultation with a view to arriving at a postcode model that best meets the needs of the stakeholders and measures the likely costs and benefits of the introduction of such a postcode.</P>
        <P>The board has now presented to me for my consideration its recommendation as to the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland, the costs and benefits arising from its introduction along with a detailed implementation plan. I am now considering the next steps including any government approvals, tender processes, legislative requirements and administrative supports required to introduce the recommended model by 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the fact that my function in relation to the Corrib Gas Field is a regulatory one, I have been endeavouring to create the conditions that would allow the difficulties associated with this project to be resolved. Arising from local concerns about safety, I had a comprehensive safety review of the onshore upstream gas pipeline carried out by Advantica consultants last year. The Technical Advisory Group, (TAG) which supervised the safety review, made a series of <Col N="2016"/>further recommendations, covering, among other things, issues of design code, the drawing up of a Pipeline Integrity Management Plan and a range of measures on which the developer would have to gain TAG&rsquo;s approval to ensure that the actual construction and installation of the pipeline would be to highest international standards.</P>
        <P>I published the full details of all of these recommendations in May of this year. The developer, Shell, has accepted the recommendations made by both Advantica and TAG and has committed itself to meeting all of these requirements fully. No further consents will be issued by me until I am satisfied that these are being met in full.</P>
        <P>I also appointed Mr. Peter Cassells as mediator in the dispute. Mr. Cassells has concluded his work and reported in July 2006 and does not have any ongoing role. Shell has accepted the recommendations made by the mediator.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Shell has indicated publicly that it is considering alternative pipeline routes and will consult widely when it has come to a conclusion in relation to options.</P>
        <P>I am of the view that the Advantica, TAG and the Cassells reports have paved the way for this project to move forward. While my Department has regular contact with Shell in its capacity as the developer of the project I do not have any role in relation to the current situation at Bellanaboy which relates to the developer gaining access to its own site with a view to undertaking work on this important project in accordance with approvals already issued to it.</P>

	<P>The competent authority for fisheries control in Ireland is the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources through its control services. This work is carried out through close co-operation with the Irish Naval Service and Aer Corps. The Naval Service, from its base at Haulbowline, controls and monitors all fisheries activities within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone (EFZ).  Sea-Fishery Protection Officers in my Department form the land-based control services for ports and other landing places.</P>
        <P>All fishing vessels, whether Irish or foreign registered, operating within the Irish fisheries patrol area, are subject to checks by Irish control authorities, at sea or in Irish ports. Checks at sea include inspection of records and catch onboard to ensure the proper recording of catches in the EU logbook. The Department&rsquo;s land-based control services carry out regular checks of fishing vessels landing into Irish ports.</P>
        <P>The Irish South and West Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation (IS&amp;WFO) have a general perception that the control authorities are unfairly targeting Irish vessels. The statistics do not support this view. The pattern of sightings versus boardings remains consistent over the past number of years and the Naval Service are extremely conscious of maintaining an even-handed approach to boarding and inspecting all vessels active in the Irish EFZ. Targeting of vessels is not a factor unless the Naval Service is tasked to a specific fishery of fishery control (e.g. Cod Closure box or Hake closed box).</P>
        <P>The Naval Service has indicated that, so far in 2006, 758 Irish vessels and 829 non-Irish vessels have been boarded. This equates to a 47.7% Irish-52.3% non-Irish split. The individual country statistics indicate that the Naval Service boards 74% of all Irish vessels it encounters. This compares with an encountered vs. boarding figure of 79% for French vessels, 89% for Spanish vessels and 90% for UK vessels. It may also be seen by comparing to last year&rsquo;s figures that the percentage of Irish vessels boarded remains constant for a similar period this year.</P>
        <P>The statistics clearly show that more than half of the boardings conducted by the Naval Service inspection vessels are of nationalities other than Irish.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that there is no basis for any assertion that the Irish control authorities discriminate against Irish vessels and in favour of foreign-registered vessels, nor indeed would the reverse be the case either.</P>
        <P>Consultations with the industry take place on an ongoing basis at varying levels within my Department. A formal two-way high level consultation process also takes place through the Sea Fisheries Liaison Group comprising industry representatives and senior officials of my Department, which meets on a monthly basis approximately and which I also attend as often as possible.</P><Col N="2019"/>
        <P>I appointed an independent Seafood Strategy Review Group in June 2006 to devise a strategy for a sustainable and profitable Irish Seafood industry over the period 2007-2013. Regional meetings have taken place at a number of locations around the country for the purpose of consultation with key stakeholders. The strategy is to be completed at an early date and its findings will also feed into the new National Development Plan for the period 2007&ndash;2013.</P>
        <P>I believe that this Strategy, along with the new National Development Plan, will provide for a sustainable and viable industry into the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 42, 68 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>It has always been my view that the Deloitte report would stand as an important contribution to the wider debate on future energy policy directions. I decided therefore to publish the report in the context of the Green Paper when finalised and which was published on 1 October 2006.</P>
        <P>One of the main messages coming out of the Deloitte report is that, without changing the current structure of the Irish electricity market, challenges in developing competition and choice for consumers will remain. The report makes a specific recommendation to fragment the ESB as a way of delivering competition in generation and supply.</P>
        <P>The Government is firmly of the view that there is strategic value in maintaining a strong, commercially viable ESB into the future and does not, therefore, favour the fragmentation or privatisation of the ESB. Nor does the Government intend to privatise EirGrid. Retaining the natural monopoly networks in State ownership is a core policy tenet for the Government.</P>
        <P>The Government agrees that structural reform is necessary in the interests of facilitating the development of a competitive market in electricity, providing consumer choice and driving efficiencies within the ESB itself. The creation of the Single Electricity Market in 2007 is a critical context also.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper indicates the lines of action which the Government is considering as a means of achieving the necessary change, including the scope for establishing a State-owned land-bank of potential generation sites and measures to tackle ESB&rsquo;s dominance in the area of price-setting plant. There are issues to be addressed in the short, medium and longer term if we are to deliver a more competitive transparent and secure energy market on the island of Ireland.</P>

	<P>My core policy objectives for the development of the broadcasting sector are detailed in my Depart<Col N="2022"/>ment&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy, 2005&ndash; 2007. These objectives are: </P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />To create an environment that encourages the maintenance of high quality Irish radio and television services by both independent broadcasters and RT&Eacute;.</P>

        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />To seek to retain access to a range of high quality programming in analogue and digital form, on a universal and free-to-air basis.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003 encourages both private and public broadcasters to include additional programming of a particular character in their programme schedules.  On 13th October 2005 I wrote to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland formally approving the scheme entitled &ldquo;Sound &amp; Vision&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The scheme can be used to support the development of additional programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience; programmes aimed at improving adult literacy, and in the Irish language. The Act also provides that the scheme may be used for the development of an archive of programme material produced in the State. The scheme is open to broadcasters and independent producers.</P>
        <P>The amount payable annually under Section 4(2) of the Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003 is equal to 5 per cent of net receipts of broadcasting licence fees. The amount available under the scheme at the beginning of 2006 stood at in excess of &euro;25m.</P>
        <P>The first round of funding of &ldquo;Sound &amp; Vision&rdquo; announced by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in February 2006 saw the allocation of a total of &euro;11m in funding for programming. This first funding round allocated &euro;10.5m to thirty-seven television projects and &euro;0.5m to forty-five radio initiatives.</P>
        <P>A second round, under the &ldquo;Sound and Vision&rdquo; scheme, was launched by the BCI in March 2006 and has seen the allocation of in excess of &euro;10m &mdash; &euro;9.59m has been allocated to thirty nine television projects and &euro;0.468m to forty one radio initiatives.  The BCI propose a third round of funding before the end of 2006.</P>

	<P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and its Northern counterpart, NIAER, had set 1 July <Col N="2023"/>2007 as the go-live date for the Single Electricity Market (SEM). However following extensive consultation with the transmission system operators and the industry, the regulators advised that the go-live date should be extended by four months to 1 November 2007.</P>
        <P>In August 2006, I accepted that recommendation, as did the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Peter Hain. We agreed that the SEM benefits can best be maximised by building into the project plan some additional time for project assurance, impact analysis and market trials. This will ensure that the challenges associated with the implementation of these complex arrangements are fully addressed for all parties including, most importantly, customers and market participants. It is essential that we give the regulators, the transmission system operators and industry the necessary time to finalise the design and implement the market so that it delivers key benefits to both economies.</P>
        <P>Both Governments remain fully committed to the introduction of the Single Electricity Market during 2007, with full &ldquo;go-live&rdquo; of the market by November 2007, I am confident that this target will be met.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 74 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may already be aware, RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s statutory mandate, as defined in Section 28(1) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s radio and television services shall be made available, in so far as is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the Island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>As such, RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s statutory mandate does not extend to the provision of radio or television services to Irish communities living in Britain or elsewhere.  As a consequence RT&Eacute; may not use the proceeds of the television licence fee to provide such services.</P>
        <P>However, it should be noted that many people living outside of the Island of Ireland already enjoy access to a considerable quantity of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s television programming by way of the Internet, and to RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s radio services by way of satellite, LW and MW and the Internet.</P>
        <P>In the light of the recommendations of the Task Force on Emigration, it is proposed to amend the public service remits of RT&Eacute; and TG4 to allow for the provision and public funding of broadcasting services to Irish communities in Britain.</P>
        <P>The proposals to amend the Broadcasting Act, 2001 are contained in the draft general scheme of the Broadcasting Bill, which has been submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for the purposes of public consultation under the eConsultation initiative.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation, and relevant national players keep a close watch on developments, and potential developments, in international energy markets that may impact on the Irish market. This includes developments in the British wholesale gas market.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for monitoring the security of Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas supply lies with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). Under the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002, the CER is required to prepare an annual Gas Capacity Statement, which provides a 7-year rolling fore<Col N="2025"/>cast of capacity, flows and customer demand on Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas system. The forecast also assesses, for a range of possible scenarios, whether projected supplies of gas from indigenous sources, imports and storage, are sufficient to meet forecast demand.</P>
        <P>One of the main conclusions of the 2006 Gas Capacity Statement, which was published by the CER in July 2006 and covers the period 2006 &ndash; 2013, is that the existing Irish gas transmission system is sufficient to cope with reasonable expectations of demand, both on the peak and on the minimum day under most conditions for the period of this Statement.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I am advised by the Commission that it recently met with both the UK Department of Trade and Industry and Ofgem, the UK regulator, and received confirmation that the outlook with respect to gas supplies to the UK, and consequently to Ireland, has improved significantly from earlier on this year due to increasing certainty over key infrastructure developments and the availability of storage facilities in the UK in time for the coming winter period.</P>
        <P>As a result, the Commission advises me that it is satisfied there is reasonable certainty over the supplies of imported gas to Ireland this winter, in the context of both gas customers and the power generation sector.</P>
        <P>Security of supply in relation to electricity is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005. Article 28 provides that it shall be the duty of the Commission to monitor the security of supply of electricity and that the Commission shall take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply.</P>
        <P>In the performance of its monitoring and corrective functions, the Commission is advised by EirGrid, the independent Transmission System Operator. The issue of alerts for the electricity system is a matter for EirGrid who advise me that system alerts are internal industry signals to generators to encourage caution at times when the margin between capacity and demand is tight. They are used to reduce the chances of a failure of a generator which could lead to a shortage overall and are therefore considered a normal part of the functioning of the generation system initiated to support the system.</P>
        <P>With specific regard to electricity supply stability, the most recent advice available to me from EirGrid and the Commission is that there is adequate generation capacity to meet demand in accordance with security standards for the coming winter and into the medium term.</P>
        <P>The Commission advises me nevertheless that the occurrence of any alerts on the system is contingent on both the level of demand over the winter, which will be determined, in part, by the weather, and the availability of plant to meet that demand. Similar to recent winters, during times <Col N="2026"/>of peak demand, the Commission anticipates that there may be times when alerts will be initiated in order to signal the appropriate actions for generators.</P>
        <P>I am assured however that the Commission and EirGrid are investigating additional measures that can be put in place to minimise the occurrence of instances where alerts are called for.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Security of supply in relation to electricity is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 60 of 2005). Specifically, Article 28 provides that it shall be the duty of the Commission to monitor the security of supply of electricity and that the Commission shall take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply. In the performance of its monitoring and corrective functions, the EirGrid, the independent Transmission System Operator, advises the Commission.</P>
        <P>Under the 2005 Regulations, the CER is required to publish a report on Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply of electricity. The report describes the Commission&rsquo;s monitoring activities, presents the conclusions drawn from that monitoring and the measures being taken, or planned to be taken, to protect Ireland&rsquo;s security of electricity supply.</P>
        <P>One of the main conclusions of the first Security of Supply of Electricity Report, which was published by the Commission at the end of August this year, is that the development of generation plant producing from fossil fuels will continue to be required in the medium term to ensure security of supply as demand continues to grow. During this time, wind will remain the most significant alternative to fossil fuels on the system. The Commission and EirGrid have put in place mechanisms such as the Group Processing Approach to wind connections to ensure that the largest sustainable volume of wind is brought onto the system taking into account all technical requirements, including those relating to security and reliability of supply.</P>
        <P>The Commission, in its report, also recognises that the addition of wind and other renewable generation to the energy mix enhances fuel diversity. In particular, both the CER and EirGrid acknowledge that the anticipated growth in renewables will require a generation portfolio, which is flexible and responsive, as well as further interconnection.</P><Col N="2029"/>
        <P>This view is consistent with policy options set out in the Government&rsquo;s recently published Green Paper on Energy, which sets ambitious targets for renewable energy (15% by 2010 and 30% by 2020).</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Government is concerned to ensure that adequate provision is made to encourage the development of an electricity portfolio, which can support and complement the aggressive targets which we have now set for renewable growth. I can assure the Deputy that decisions by the CER, EirGrid and the Government will be informed by the need to ensure capacity and competition in the generation sector while reflecting the overriding consideration of security of supply.</P>

The development of ICT provision for primary and post-primary schools is, in the first instance a matter for the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>My Department works closely with the Department of Education and Science on broadband connectivity for schools. In June 2004 a joint industry/Government fund of &euro;18 million was established for the Broadband for Schools Programme to resource the provision of high speed broadband connectivity to all primary and post primary schools in the country by end Autumn 2006, at no cost to the schools themselves. The initiative was established to address the resourcing of broadband access to schools in the shared belief that accelerated provision of broadband access to schools is a prerequisite to the establishment of a knowledge based economy and that such a development is socially, economically and commercially desirable.  To date 95% of all primary and secondary schools have broadband installed; the aim is to complete the outstanding schools as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Broadband for Schools Programme will improve and ensure the quality of the education experience, giving students and teachers access to global information sources.

	<P>The Power of One campaign, which I launched on September 26th 2006, is a multi-annual, national awareness campaign focusing on energy efficiency and the benefits to consumers, the economy and the environment.</P>
        <P>Energy efficiency is a major priority of Irish and EU policy and The Power of One campaign has been created in the context of one single overriding objective &mdash; to achieve real and measurable change in consumer awareness and behaviour on energy efficiency. The campaign will encompass:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Building awareness of the types and sources of energy we use and the costs and environmental impacts of their use;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Raising awareness of the impact of inefficient use of energy in terms of increased costs to the user, the economy and the environment;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Informing and empowering the general public on best practices in terms of saving energy at home and at work;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Targeting individual sectors (e.g. industry, SMEs, schools, the public sector, the transport sector) with tailored messages, roadshows and seminars; and</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Highlighting and building on existing programmes and activities in operation on the island of Ireland and taking account of relevant EU policies and initiatives.</P>
        <P FLI="0">One of the initiatives of the campaign is the The Power of One Street which involves the creation of a virtual street that represents the key demographic and housing types across the country. Householders throughout the country can now apply to take part in this initiative via <i>www.powerofonestreet.ie</i> and these homes and residents will be monitored to assess energy efficiency behaviours and subsequent environmental and financial impacts and the results will be publicly available to show us what we, in our turn, can do. Residents will have the opportunity to win appliance upgrades and prizes based on their participation in the programme.</P><Col N="2031"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>Overall the aim is to achieve behavioural change to a more energy-efficient lifestyle, at home and at work, by every Irish energy user, which will reduce energy use, have environmental benefits and reduce costs. The impact of energy price rises due primarily to global market trends can be reduced if energy demand is managed more efficiently and energy use is reduced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The launch of the campaign which has included extensive airtime for the first television advertisement, media interviews, press ads and internet coverage will be followed by a series of &lsquo;Show me how&rsquo; television and radio ads, which will outline specific areas of energy consumption such as appliance usage, lighting etc., where all consumers will be shown, through a human approach, how they can change their behaviour. The messages are targeted to encourage behavioural change within each of the key audiences and will be aired on TV, radio, billboards and in press, with back-up from web and free-phone enquiry service.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing with Northern colleagues as part of the range of shared energy initiatives to expand this to an all-island campaign over time. An all-island approach to energy efficiency will complement existing cooperation on renewable energy and overall work to deliver the Single Electricity Market.</P>
        <P>The Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive requires that member states submit their first Energy Efficient Action Plan (EEAP) by 30 June 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>The future of the post office network, post office closures and the availability of post office facilities in rural Ireland are a matter, in the first instance, for the board and management of An Post.  This Government and the Board of An Post are committed to the objective of ensuring the <Col N="2032"/>continuation of a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network as set out in the Programme for Government. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size.</P>
        <P>I have asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long term viability of the post office network.</P>
        <P>It was to this end that the Government recently gave its approval for An Post to enter into a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis to set up a retail banking business. This will entail the provision of a range of financial services operated through the post office branch network, using the An Post brand and other An Post assets. Key to the Government approval of this joint venture was that it not only offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network but that it will, in time, greatly benefit the income streams of postmasters.</P>
        <P>In relation to the terms and conditions of postmasters, including funding, severance packages and the funding of such packages are a matter for the company and the postmasters. However, I appointed Mr. Eamonn Ryan to act as facilitator between the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union and An Post to identify issues of mutual concern, including the possibility of an exit package, and plot a roadmap for their resolution. In this regard, Mr. Ryan recently completed a report on these issues and made a number of recommendations. I understand that these are now the subject of ongoing discussions between the IPU and An Post.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that there are two mechanisms for the issue of licences in the Irish offshore.  The &lsquo;open door&rsquo; system applies to areas which are more accessible and which include the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea. Under this system applications may be made at any time. A number of applications for authorisations are on hand and are being processed by my Department.</P>
        <P>The &lsquo;Licensing Round&rsquo; system applies to more challenging areas including the frontier areas of the Atlantic Margin. Under this system the areas remain closed until opened for applications under <Col N="2033"/>licensing rounds. Applications may then be made within a certain timeframe and subject to conditions which are specific to that round. Under this system the Slyne/Erris/Donegal Licensing Round was announced last year with a closing date of 15th March last. I announced on 19th August my intention to make offers of four exploration licences and I expect these licences to be issued shortly.</P>
        <P>I also announced my decision that the next licensing round should take place in the Porcupine Basin. This is planned for 2007 and I will announce further details shortly.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that details of licences issued are included in the six-monthly reports which I lay before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

        <P>ComReg have awarded over 200 local area licences to a total of 12 FWA operators and there were over 52,000 subscribers using fixed wireless access for broadband services at the end of June 2006, a growth rate of almost 200% in 12 months. In effect this means that FWA is the largest alternative platform for provision of broadband competition to DSL in Ireland.  Coverage areas for these licences, is available from ComReg.

	<P>There are currently thirteen offshore Petroleum Exploration Licences, two onshore Petroleum Exploration Licences and one offshore Reserved Area Licence.  There are also twelve Licensing Options, all in offshore areas, which give the holder first right to an Exploration Licence over all or part of the area covered by the Option.</P>
        <P>I require the holders of these authorisations to undertake extensive work programmes. In many cases, these work programmes include the drilling of an exploration well, which currently can cost between 20 and 40 million euro. There is no commercial value in any of these authorisations unless they lead to a commercial discovery.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-petroleum minerals, exploration and development is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999. Extraction of minerals under the Acts is subject to payment of royalties to the State. New exploration is continuously undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of Prospecting Licences, of which there are currently 284. Details of these Licenses can be found in the six monthly reports to the Oireachtas which I am obliged to lay before the House under the Acts. The last such report was in respect of the six-month period ended 30 June 2006 which was recently laid before this House.</P>
        <P>No new economic deposits of non-petroleum minerals have been discovered in recent years. There have been some encouraging results however. Exploration adjacent to existing base metal mines at Navan, Co. Meath (Tara Mines Ltd.) and Galmoy, Co. Kilkenny (Arcon Mines Ltd.) has discovered additional resources, which have the potential to extend the life of those mines.</P>

	<P>The licensing of local and Community radio is currently a matter for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI). The BCI carries out its functions under the Radio and Television Act 1988. In this regard, the BCI is charged with the orderly development of sound broadcasting services and with ensuring the appropriate development of the sector.</P>
        <P>The legislative proposals contained in the draft general scheme of the Broadcasting Bill propose the establishment of a Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to assume the functions of the BCI, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the <Col N="2036"/>existing regulatory functions of the RT&Eacute; Authority.</P>
        <P>The proposals charge the proposed Broadcasting Authority of Ireland with amongst other matters, the stimulation of the provision of high quality, diverse and innovative programming by commercial, community and public service broadcasters, and the provision of a regulatory environment that will facilitate the development of a broadcasting sector that is responsive to audience needs.</P>
        <P>These proposals have been submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for the purposes of public consultation under the eConsultation initiative.</P>
        <P>I propose to introduce the Broadcasting Bill into the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2007 in the light of the outcome of the consultation process.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent regulator.  Challenges with regard to the enabling of exchanges are entirely a matter for Eircom.  I am not aware of any formal statement of intent on the part of Eircom to separate its retail and wholesale elements. Any such decision would be a matter for the company and it would require careful analysis by ComReg to determine what the implications might be.  Local loop unbundling is a legal requirement under the EU Telecoms Framework and is vital to the development of competitive broadband services for consumers in Ireland. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>Gas and oil are internationally traded commodities and Ireland is essentially a price taker. Any price volatility in these circumstances has a resultant impact on our energy costs. Nonetheless, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is required under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002 and the European Communities (Internal Market in Natural Gas) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 320 of 2005) to exercise its functions in a manner that protects the interests of final customers of electricity and natural gas and also to promote competition in the supply of electricity and natural gas. These obligations would also support the principle of cost reflexivity in the setting of supply tariffs.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, recently published by my Department has opened up the debate on the shape of policy directions for the future.  In particular it poses questions as to what actions should <Col N="2040"/>be taken domestically to reduce the cost of electricity and gas to consumers and to reduce fuel poverty?  I am looking forward to an imaginative debate on these issues, which will no doubt inform policy in this regard going forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The size and scale of the post office network is a matter for the management and board of the company.  However, I have asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long term viability of the post office network and in this light, An Post is currently working on a financial services initiative which could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices. It is in this context that the Government recently gave its approval for An Post to enter into a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis to set up a retail banking business. </P>
        <P>With respect to mail services, I believe that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post in delivery of mails and parcels. However, over the coming years competition can be expected to increase in these sectors, whether from the privately owned express sector, from the large European public operators now looking for international business or from electronic substitution. Liberalisation of the mail market in Ireland has already commenced and the second Postal Directive proposes that the postal sector is to fully liberalise across the EU on 1 January 2009 subject to political agreement, which, if achieved, would open up the letter post area to full competition.</P>
        <P>Therefore, in terms of dealing with the challenges facing An Post in the coming years, company management in conjunction with the trade unions, must deliver on restructuring agreements particularly in the mails area. The development of the postal market requires the availability of competitive, high quality products. The current level of market opening has introduced new players with offerings that meet consumer needs and further market opening will provide further opportunities for new and existing players. The development of further competition allied with a modernised and customer-focussed An Post will provide the basis for the further development of the postal sector here.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 95 together.</P>
        <P>A digital terrestrial television (DTT) pilot programme is currently being implemented by my Department. The purpose of the pilot is to bring further momentum to the transition to digital terrestrial broadcasting and to test and trial various aspects of the service. The DTT pilot is now in the &ldquo;soft trial&rdquo; phase during which the network and user technologies will be tested. The initial transmission sites are at Clermont Carn in the north east and Three Rock covering parts of the Dublin region. The trial is planned to continue over a two-year timeframe and will provide the opportunity for technical and user testing of both existing and new broadcast services, including both television and audio services.</P>
        <P>My Department has began with legislation on preparing digital terrestrial television and is examining all the options with regard to putting in place a legislative framework for national DTT roll-out. It is anticipated that the pilot will gener<Col N="2042"/>ate awareness and discussion among interested parties in a full national roll-out of digital terrestrial television. As the trial progresses and proposals are developed for a national rollout of digital terrestrial television, the question of possible analogue switch-off dates will be considered.</P>
        <P>Switch-off of analogue television services is being strongly advocated by the European Commission, with 2012 a target date suggested by the Commission. While the pilot is underway, I intend to hold discussions with all relevant stakeholders around the issue of digital switchover. When decisions have been taken about the nature and timing of analogue switch over, it will be necessary to ensure that Irish viewers are fully informed of all the issues arising. During the summer, the International Telecommunications Union held an international conference to plan the use of the frequency spectrum for digital Broadcasting. Ireland was represented at that conference by officials from my Department along with representatives from ComReg, BCI and RT&Eacute;.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased with the outcome of the conference. In addition to obtaining the necessary spectrum to allow for the initial roll-out of DTT nationwide, Ireland has also secured the right to reuse the existing analogue transmission frequencies for digital use. This will facilitate not only the introduction of DTT nationwide, but also permit the development of many new and innovative services, such as mobile television, high definition television or interactive television, particularly following the switch-off of the analogue services. My Department is currently examining how the spectrum should be used so that it can fully contribute to the development of broadcasting in a knowledge-based society.</P>

	<P>It was to this end that the Government recently gave its approval for An Post to enter into a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis to set up a retail banking business. This will entail the provision of a range of financial services operated through the post office branch network, using the An Post brand and other An Post assets. Key to the Government approval of this joint venture was that it not only offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network but that it will, in time, greatly benefit the income streams of postmasters. </P>
        <P>In regard to the automation of the network, there are currently 386 non-automated post offices in the country which account for just over 2% of the current business of the network. The company has recently completed a pilot project <Col N="2044"/>in which ten smaller post offices were fully automated. It is intended to evaluate the business generated and the income gains in these newly automated offices, in order to see if there is a justified commercial case for further automation of non-automated offices. While merchandising of joint venture products will be available throughout the network, servicing of certain products will not be available at the non-automated offices. However, given the relatively low level of business conducted at these offices, the company does not envisage that the operation of the joint venture will be adversely affected by the non-automation of the entire network.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Support programmes put in place by the Government have more than doubled the capacity of renewable energy powered electricity generating plants connected to the electricity network in the last two years. Last May I launched a new support programme which moved away from an emphasis on competitive tendering operated over the previous decade to a fixed price type support mechanism known as the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff. Last month I announced the allocation of the first tranche of support, under REFIT, to fifty five new renewable powered electricity generating plants.</P><Col N="2045"/>
        <P>I have announced our intention to treble the contribution by renewable energy sources from 5% of electricity produced to 15% by 2010. The Green Paper on Energy Policy also proposes a target of 30% by 2020. The REFIT initiative will be pivotal in ensuring that the Government&rsquo;s 15% target is met by 2010 and provide the platform along with actions to address technology challenges, for achieving a 30% target by 2020.</P>

	<P>One of the strategic objectives set down in the All-island energy development framework for natural gas is a common approach on natural gas storage and LNG. With this in mind, the issue of a strategic gas reserve is one of the issues to be addressed by means of an all-island study to be commissioned jointly by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment Northern <Col N="2046"/>Ireland. Both Departments are currently engaged in a tender process in this regard.   The successful tenderer will be required to assess the medium to long-term position with regard to security of natural gas supply and consider the scope for a common approach on storage and LNG with a view to optimising that position. The final study will have regard to industry views and to any existing capacities as well as to planned or proposed developments for storage and LNG in the island of Ireland. It is my intention that a contract for the study will be placed by the end of January next at the latest with a view to the report being finalised by mid 2007. </P>
        <P>Security of supply in relation to electricity is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 60 of 2005). Specifically, Article 28 provides that it shall be the duty of the Commission to monitor the security of supply of electricity and that the Commission shall take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply. In the performance of its monitoring and corrective functions, the Commission is advised by the EirGrid, the Independent Transmission System Operator.</P>
        <P>In its latest Generation Adequacy Report 2006-2012, the TSO identifies system operation issues as a result of increasing wind generation as one of the key issues to be addressed to ensure that electricity demand continues to be met. With this in mind, I am advised by the Commission that it has requested the TSO to update it&rsquo;s study carried out in 2004 on the economic and operational impacts of wind penetration with a view to identifying any necessary actions which need to be taken.</P>
        <P>With regard to electricity storage projects, the Commission advises me that while it would welcome initiatives in relation to electricity storage and the potential benefits which could be accrued from these, it would not view them at present as having a significant role in relation to security of supply. In terms of security of supply, the Commission advise that other mechanisms such as increased interconnection, the development of the Single Electricity Market, continued improvements in thermal plant efficiency and availability as well as medium to long term needs for new plant should be given priority consideration in order to ensure generation adequacy into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent recommendations of the head of the Council of European Energy Regulators, which were made in the context of its response to the EU Green Paper on Energy, have been brought to my attention. I am awaiting the outcome of the ongoing deliberations on this issue at EU level, prior to making any decisions as to whether further legislative measures are needed in the Irish context.  Currently, the Minister has certain limited statutory powers to give directions to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in relation to electricity trading arrangements solely. As the Deputy is aware the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 contains provisions to allow me, as Minister, to provide general policy directions to the CER in the interests of the proper and effective regulation of the electricity and natural gas markets to be followed by the CER in the exercise of its functions. </P>
        <P>Security of supply in relation to electricity is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005. These Regulations give the CER formal responsibility in law for security of supply of electricity with much greater powers to act to secure and enhance supply. The CER has been empowered to take any measures necessary to protect security of supply. In particular, it can host a competition to acquire the necessary generation or it can direct the Transmission System Operator (TSO), ESB or any licensed undertaking to implement any arrangements that the CER considers necessary to protect the security of supply.</P>
        <P>The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 also provides for emergency powers of direction in the event of a sudden crisis in the energy market and where the physical safety or security of persons, apparatus or installations, or the integrity of the natural gas or electricity transmission system or the natural gas or electricity distribution system is threatened. These powers ensure that in these circumstances I, as Minister, may by order direct the CER or other energy undertakings to take such safeguard measures as I consider necessary. The Energy Policy Green Paper, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future, states that fuel poverty is a matter of concern to Government, which is being addressed in the formulation of energy policy. The Green Paper also notes the role of the Department for Social and Family Affairs in administering the National Fuel Scheme.</P><Col N="2048"/>
        <P>A public consultation on this Green Paper is ongoing and one of the key questions for consultation is: What further action should be taken to alleviate fuel poverty? Any proposals to alleviate fuel poverty will be given my full consideration. In this context, I will consider whether the use of the power of direction to the CER is appropriate or necessary, upon enactment of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006.</P>

	<P>Following reporting by the United Kingdom authorities to the EU Commission of undeclared landings of mackerel by Irish vessels into Scotland in 2005, the EU Commission deducted 6,578 tonnes from Ireland&rsquo;s 2006 mackerel quota under Commission Regulation 742/2006. Following extensive consultations with the European Commission, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, and industry representatives and having considered all the issues involved and options available in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy, I adopted a policy to address the reductions to Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota in 2006.</P>
        <P>The deductions will be applied to the allocations of those vessel owners in respect of whom I am satisfied, following full consideration of representations made to me by the vessels owners identified, have breached Community regulations and landed undeclared mackerel. I have written to the individual vessel owners involved and I will examine any representations as may be made on an individual basis. Having considered the representations made, I will make the requisite adjustments in respect of the management of the autumn fishery.</P>
        <P>Any balance of the 6,578 tonnes deduced from Ireland&rsquo;s 2006 mackerel quota, which is not met following the applications of these reductions to the allocations of vessel owners who I am satisfied breached Community Regulations and landed mackerel illegally, will be applied to the other vessels in the RSW Pelagic fleet on a pro rata basis.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing with the EU Commission in relation to the methodology, scaling and timing of deductions in respect of undeclared landings in the period 2001-2004 as indicated as <Col N="2049"/>a result of the UK investigations The matter of addressing any reductions to Ireland&rsquo;s future mackerel quota to address the reported undeclared illegal landings in the period 2001-2004 will fall for consideration at a future date.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the Scottish authorities to take action as they see fit and in accordance with their own legislation. The Deputy will appreciate that Ireland must act in accordance with our own legal system as well as within EU law. This has required careful consideration of all the issues before deciding on a course of action, having regard in particular to principles of fairness and natural justice.</P>

	<P>I am advised that pair trawling does occur in the Shannon Estuary. However, I also understand that such trawling takes place sporadically for herring and sprat and is seasonal in nature. The vessels involved mainly fish during late autumn and winter and I am advised that the main calving season for Bottlenose Dolphins in this area is in early summer and consequently pair trawling is not considered to present a significant threat in that regard.</P><Col N="2050"/>
        <P>While the Marine Institute has advised me that they are aware that there are bottlenose dolphin in this area they do not have specific information on the by-catch from the pair trawl fishery in the Shannon Estuary.

	<P>The development of further interconnection with neighbouring markets is a key strategic priority for the Government. The delivery of further interconnection to Northern Ireland and to Britain is central to security of supply. It is also fully in line with the EU emphasis on physical interconnection. Work is underway jointly by EirGrid and SONI on a new North South electricity interconnector for completion by 2011. The Government has endorsed plans to expedite the construction of a 500 MW electricity interconnector between Wales and Ireland. The Government has requested the CER to undertake a competition to select a developer to secure the construction of this interconnector no later than 2012. </P>
        <P>To facilitate the development process, the Government is providing new arrangements in respect of the construction ownership and operation of future interconnectors in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006. In that regard I have already confirmed the Government&rsquo;s intention to vest the ownership of the new East/West Interconnector in EirGrid.  The Bill, which is currently at Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, provides that the CER may, with my consent, secure the construction of an interconnector by one or more means, including by competitive tender. Such consent will be contingent on final Government approval.  Working together with the Northern Ireland authorities, the Government will continue to progress electricity interconnection initiatives in the context of the All-island Energy Market. The two transmission system operators, Northern Ireland Electricity <Col N="2052"/>and EirGrid, recently announced plans for a second North-South electricity interconnector, This will more than double the existing cross-border electricity transfer capacity to over 600MW with an expected completion date of 2012 at the latest.  Planning for decisions in relation to the further interconnection with Britain or potentially with the European mainland will begin in 2010.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent regulator.  Data used by the EU and <Col N="2053"/>the OECD for broadband comparison purposes defines a subscriber as a household. It is estimated that there are approximately 1.4 million households in Ireland and each household is a potential subscriber. Connecting households to a broadband service is entirely a matter for broadband service providers. </P>
        <P>Under the Regional Broadband Programme, my Department, in partnership with the Local Authorities, has been facilitating competition in the broadband market by deploying open access fibre metropolitan area networks. These networks have increased competition and have had positive impacts on price, quality and choice of service provider.  The majority of towns now have at least one provider offering broadband services. However, it has been clear for some time that there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. I am currently considering options to address the gaps in broadband coverage.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s broadband take-up is growing very strongly. It is estimated that there were 410,000 broadband subscribers in Ireland by mid September 2006. This means that 29% of households now have broadband.  Broadband take-up in Ireland grew by 112% over the first 8.5 months of 2006 and is growing at twice the EU broadband growth rate.</P>

	<P>A number of innovative alternative energy programmes are in place as part of a &euro;65m initiative announced in <Col N="2056"/>the context of Budget 2006. The programme is being rolled-out over a five year period and provides funding for the domestic, commercial, services and industrial sectors as follows: The &euro;27m &ldquo;Greener Homes&rdquo; domestic renewable heat grants programme is providing grants for householders for the purpose of installing renewable heating including wood biomass boilers and stoves, solar panels and heat pumps; the &euro;22m Bioheat grants programme provides grants for commercial scale wood biomass boilers aimed at the business and services sectors; the &euro;11m Combined Heat and Power grants programme is providing funding for the commercial sector to switch to more efficient electricity and heat generation.</P>
        <P>In addition to these funding measures, a number of other financial initiatives have been introduced. In July, I launched a five-year excise relief programme for biofuels, valued at over &euro;200m. The programme builds on a pilot initiative rolled out in 2005, in which eight biofuels project were granted excise relief over a two-year period.  In June, I launched the Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff which is providing a fixed feed-in-tariff for renewable electricity over a fifteen year period.</P>
        <P>The Bio-energy Ministerial Task Force will develop, by end-year a cohesive national bioenergy strategy including biofuels. Further initiatives including the question of additional supports are being considered in the context of developments to date the Green Paper on Energy Policy, and the Estimates and Budgetary processes.</P>

	<P>Bord na M&oacute;na was given approval in October 2005 to develop its future strategy proposals, specifically in the waste management, renewable energy and environmental solutions areas. The approval not only supports the concept of maximum commercial freedom for the Company but also ensures the long-term viability of the Company having regard to the declining and finite nature of its existing businesses.  Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s immediate projects currently being pursued include the construction of a wind farm in North Mayo and examination of other sites for similar projects, the development of a waste management facility at Drehid, Co. Kildare, and possible involvement in the co-fuelling of an existing power plant with renewable resources. </P><Col N="2057"/>
        <P>The Drehid waste management facility will comprise a fully enclosed composting plant primarily to handle biowaste from household, commercial and industrial sources, and a residual landfill.

Bord na M&oacute;na plc currently operates a licensed landfill facility for the disposal of ash produced by Edenderry Power Limited.</P>
        <P>As you are aware, the Programme for Government, agreed in June 2002, states that the Government will approach the issue of the appropriate form of ownership or structure for state companies on a case-by-case basis and will support the maximum commercial freedom of semi-state companies, subject to the fulfilment of national strategic and balanced regional policy objectives. The Government has no plans for the privatisation of Bord na M&oacute;na plc.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 105 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open-access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in 120 towns and cities nationwide.  Phase One of this Programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>This Programme has been extended to over 90 towns in various locations nationwide under Phase Two. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. The initial target customers of the MANs will be large corporate users and extending to SMEs and residential broadband users in the medium term.</P>
        <P>The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the Group Broadband Scheme. The scheme is <Col N="2058"/>technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 160 projects have been approved for funding under this Programme. Although the most recent call for proposals has now closed, I expect to be announcing further schemes of this nature shortly.   A joint industry/Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the Broadband for Schools Programme to resource the provision of high speed broadband connectivity to all primary and post primary schools in the country by end Autumn 2006, at no cost to the schools themselves. 95% of schools have broadband installed to date.</P>
        <P>Despite Government investment in broadband through the regional broadband programme, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Options to address the gaps in broadband coverage are currently being considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Minister has no function in relation to access to the electricity transmission and distribution systems. These are matters for the system operators subject to directions given by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The CER, established by the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, is the statutory body with responsibility for regulation of the electricity market in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Under the Act, the CER may grant or refuse to grant a licence to generate or supply electricity. The CER must require the system operator to give priority to generating stations using renewable, sustainable or alternative energy sources.  I am advised that the CER has adopted a group processing approach in order to address the unprecedented level of applications from renewable generators for connection to the electricity network.  I understand that the Commission will announce very shortly the list of successful applicants who will be offered connections to the electricity system under the current Gate 2 phase of the group processing approach. This will result in the connection of an additional 1,300 MW of renewable generation to the electricity system.</P>
        <P>The Energy Policy Green Paper: Towards a Sustainable Energy Future sets ambitious targets for the achievement of renewable penetration as a proportion of electricity consumption in Ireland. These targets are to achieve 15% penetration by 2010 and 30% by 2020. It is planned that All-Island targets for renewables will be set <Col N="2059"/>during 2007.   A public consultation on this Green Paper is ongoing and one of the key questions for consultation is: What can be done to improve the pace and range of development of renewable energy resources for electricity generation on a sustainable basis?</P>
        <P>Any proposals to speed up and simplify access to the grid will be given my full consideration, and I will not hesitate to bring forward legislative changes or take other action if appropriate.  Currently, I have certain limited statutory powers to give directions to the CER in relation to electricity trading arrangements solely. As the Deputy is aware the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 contains provisions to allow me, as Minister, to provide general policy directions to the CER in the interests of the proper and effective regulation of the electricity and natural gas markets to be followed by the CER in the exercise of its functions.</P>

Statutory Instrument 709 of 2003 introduced by the Department transposes into Irish law the provisions of Council Directive 2000/34/EC which bring workers on sea-going fishing boats within the scope of the organisation of working time regime originally established by Council Directive 93/04/EC of 23 November 1993. These Regulations prescribe maximum hours of work and minimum hours of rest for workers on board sea-going fishing vessels, require records to be kept of their hours of work or rest and provide for enforcement measures.</P>

	<P>Discussions are ongoing in relation to the allocations for Energy Research and Development including Renewable Energy Technologies, for 2007 as part of the Estimates process. Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), the state energy agency is engaged in research, technology development and innovation in sustainable use and sourcing of energy and energy efficiency. </P>
        <P>The &euro;27m &ldquo;Greener Homes&rdquo; domestic renewable heat grants programme, which was launched in March this year, is providing grants for householders for the purpose of installing renewable heating including wood biomass boilers and stoves, solar panels and heat pumps.</P>
        <P>In the 26-week period, up to 25 September 2006, since the Greener Homes Scheme was launched, a total of 7,716 applications have been received for grant aid and of these 6,842 offers of grant aid have issued.</P><Col N="2062"/>
        <P>The new SEI Bioheat Boiler Deployment Programme provides grant support to assist the deployment of boiler s fuelled by wood chips and wood pellets and applied in large buildings/small industrial sites in Ireland. An indicative allocation of &euro;22M was made for a Bioheat Boiler Deployment Programme to run in the 2006 to 2010 time frame.</P>
        <P>The new Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Deployment Programme provides grant support to assist the deployment of small-scale (up to 1MWe) fossil fired CHP and biomass CHP systems. The CHP units simultaneously generate heat and electricity in a single process on site. By combining the electricity generating and heat processes CHP saves around 25% of the energy that would have been required to produce electricity in a conventional power station and heat in separate heat only boilers, and is therefore a very efficient way of meeting heat and energy needs.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, which is regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s regulatory and infrastructure policy has supported the private sector developing a competitive, affordable and rapidly growing broadband market that offers choice of products and providers to Irish consumers and businesses.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s broadband take-up is growing very strongly. It is estimated that there were 410,000 broadband subscribers in Ireland by mid September 2006. 29% of Irish households now have broadband (410,000 of 1.4 million). Broadband take-up in Ireland grew by 112% during the first 8.5 months of 2006 when 140,000 subscribers were added. Broadband take-up is continuing to accelerate at a rate of 19% compared to the average EU growth rate of 9%.</P>
        <P>When discussing Ireland&rsquo;s low ranking in the &lsquo;take-up&rsquo; league tables, I should highlight two important points. Firstly, the statistics used are <Col N="2063"/>based on the number of subscribing households per 100 inhabitants. Households and population are used because such data is generally available for the countries participating in the league tables. However, in Ireland&rsquo;s case, the 10.2% &ldquo;subscribers&rdquo; per 100 &ldquo;inhabitants&rdquo; does not paint an accurate picture. Ireland&rsquo;s relatively small number of households for the size of our population puts Ireland at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to the league tables. It is more accurate to highlight the fact that 29% of Irish households subscribed to a broadband service in September 2006. The last available data for the EU15 (December 2005) show that 34% of the EU15 households had broadband. I have challenged industry to deliver 500,000 subscribers by mid-2007. This is an achievable target and would bring Ireland&rsquo;s percentage of households to over 35%.</P>
        <P>Secondly, the low ranking also reflects the relatively late launch of affordable and competitive broadband services in Ireland by telecoms and cable TV companies in the early 2000s. In contrast, Ireland is now one of the fastest growing broadband markets in the European Union. In fact, broadband take-up has more than tripled to date since I set a target of 400,000 in late 2004.</P>

        <Quest> the details of the recently launched Energy Green Paper; his views on revising the targets as set out in the Green Paper or inserting measures to deal with fuel poverty or microgeneration; when the consultation process on the Green Paper will come to an end; the timeframe for the publication of the Energy White Paper; if a comprehensive energy bill will follow; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Energy Green Paper &ldquo;Towards a Sustainable Energy Future&rdquo; is the first comprehensive Energy Green Paper published by Government since the mid-1970s. The Paper sets out the proposed policy directions, targets and actions proposed out to 2020 for security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness, as the three main pillars of energy policy. </P>
        <P>The Green Paper has been published as a consultative document and while I believe that the targets set in it are challenging but attainable, they are open to review in light of the consultation process. Fuel poverty and microgeneration among other key policy measures will also be the subject of consultation over coming weeks. The consultation period continues until 1st December 2006 and I expect to be in a position to publish an Energy White Paper setting out a definitive policy framework early in 2007.</P><Col N="2064"/>
        <P>The need for additional legislative measures to underpin policy directions will be reviewed in the context of finalising the White Paper. I would note that the Energy (Miscellaneous) Bill and the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill currently before the Oireachtas together with the forthcoming Single Electricity Market Bill already represent significant new legislative arrangements for the energy sector going forward.</P>

        <P>I have, however, from an overall policy perspective, and in the context of the Green Paper highlighted the potential merits of a State-owned landbank of suitable generation sites to facilitate the development of new independent generation capacity. Discussions are underway with ESB and CER on the landbank proposition. This would require the availability of suitable sites, which I have stated, however, is ultimately a commercial decision for ESB.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the Prison Service dismantled the Mountjoy holding cell in which a person (details supplied) was killed in August 2006; and his views on whether such actions, taken immediately prior to the visit of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, gives the impression that the Prison Service is attempting to undermine a proper and independent inquiry into these events by international human rights monitors. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Director General of the Irish Prison Service made the decision, in the immediate aftermath of the incident, that for operational reasons, the holding cells would be closed with immediate effect and <Col N="2072"/>that they would no longer accommodate prisoners. It is his professional view that leaving the holding cells in use following such an incident would have been entirely inappropriate.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that this decision was in no way an attempt at any sort of cover up and such a suggestion is at odds with the actions of my Department since this tragic incident. In this regard I refer to the appointment of Mr Michael Mellett to undertake an independent investigation into the events leading to the death of Mr Douch.  He had concluded his examination of the area prior to any action being taken to convert the cells for alternative usage.  The same position applies in relation to the Garda investigation into the incident. The Garda&iacute; had indicated that they had no further requirement of the crime scene for their criminal investigation.</P>
        <P>The Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment did visit Ireland recently and both I and my officials met with them during their visit.   At no stage did the Committee make any reference to the closure of the cell in question nor did they seem to be under the impression that the Prison Service was trying to undermine their work in any way.  Indeed they commented favourably on the level of cooperation they received during their visit.</P>
        <P>The Committee have not indicated to my Department that they are carrying out any inquiry specific to the death of a prisoner although obviously they may refer to that and other matters in their general report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the Firhouse area is policed by Garda&iacute; attached to Rathfarnham Garda Station.  The personnel strength of Rathfarnham Garda Station as at 18 October 2006 was 69 Garda&iacute; (all ranks). The personnel strength of Rathfarnham Garda Station as at 31 December 1997 was 63 (all <?oasys _dc18- ?>ranks). This represents an increase of 6 (or 9.5%)<?oasys _dc0- ?> in the number of personnel allocated since then.</P>
        <P>The area is patrolled by uniform and detective patrols which are augmented by foot and mountain bike patrols.   As part of a recent crime reduction strategy under Operation Anvil two plain clothes Garda&iacute; on foot patrol have been deployed in the Firhouse/Knocklyon area and a number of Community Garda&iacute; are also assigned to the area.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the require<Col N="2075"/>ments of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Divisional Crime Task Force based in Crumlin and the Divisional Traffic unit based in Terenure also patrol the area.  The local Drugs Unit based in Tallaght are presently concentrating resources in this area.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 contains provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour. The Act empowers a senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner. In relation to children aged 12 to 18 years, specially tailored provisions, fully integrated into the Children Act 2001, provide for a number of steps. These culminate in court orders for those engaged in anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>The relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 will be commenced following consultations between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Firhouse will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>I understand that <Col N="2076"/>the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the last 12 months.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that statistics are not compiled in such way as to give the number of  drivers detected speeding at 50 to 60 km/h, 50 to 80 km/h and in excess of 100 km/h for the last 12 months.  The amount of time it would take to compile such information could not be justified and would involve a disproportionate amount of Garda time.</P>
        <P>The Garda IT system underpinning the Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) rolled out nationally for speeding offences on 2 February 2006.  The following tables sets out the  number of fixed charge notices issued for speeding offences in the 50, 60, 80 and 100 km/h speed zones for the period 2 February 2006 to 30 September 2006 by speed range.</P>

Whether the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question satisfy the statutory residency requirement depends on their having kept their permission to remain in the State up-to-date at all times.  Assuming that this is the case, it appears that the lady in question satisfied the residency requirement in May last and was eligible to submit an application for naturalisation at that time and her husband will satisfy the residency requirement at the end of this month.  Any applications for naturalisation submitted by the persons in question will be assessed against the requirements of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no upper limit on the grade which can be obtained within the Civil Service by a person with a disability.</P>
        <P>Recruitment to and promotion within the Civil Service is governed by the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 and by the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1956 -2005.  The 2004 Act provides for the establishment of the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) and of the Public Appointments Service (PAS). The CPSA publishes codes of practice prescribing the necessary <Col N="2081"/>standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness to be applied by all those carrying out recruitment and promotion under the terms of the Act. The PAS provides a centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the Civil Service.</P>

        <P>The Civil Service is an equal opportunities employer. Departments and Offices are required to apply the CPSA Code of Practice 01/06 entitled &ldquo;External and internal appointment of persons with disabilities to positions in the civil service and certain public bodies&rdquo; to matters relating to &ldquo;recruitment and appointment of persons with a disability&rdquo;. The Code requires Departments and Offices to see that &ldquo;all reasonable efforts&rdquo; are made to meet the special requirements to which some disabilities give rise so as to maximise access to employment in the Civil Service for people with disability.</P>
        <P>Recruitment competitions run by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) are open to all candidates, including those with disabilities, subject to their meeting the eligibility requirements of the competition. Competitions for promotion that are confined to existing civil servants are open to all candidates subject to their meeting the eligibility requirements of the competition.</P>
        <P>Application forms invite candidates to indicate any special requirements they may have when undergoing the selection process and every effort is made to facilitate these requests by the competition managers.</P>
        <P>A new approach to the recruitment and placement of people with a disability in the Civil Service is currently being developed with the aim of ensuring that 3% of all recruits to the Civil Service are people with a disability. It is envisaged that this approach will provide for the holding of recruitment competitions confined to candidates with a disability and for the setting up, in regular recruitment competitions, of sub-panels for such candidates. Preparations are at an advanced stage for the holding of a recruitment competition for appointment to the grade of Executive Officer confined to candidates with a disability. It is intended that the competition will be advertised before the end of 2006.</P>

	<P>My Department maintains FOI statistics in a format required for reporting purposes to the Information Commissioner.  From the data held it is not possible to develop all the specific statistical breakdowns required by the Deputy.  The following table provides the information my Department has been able to produce in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s queries.  In any analysis of the patterns relating to fees received from journalists as opposed to members of the public, it should be <Col N="2083"/>noted that journalists are heavy users of FOI and they frequently seek material covering a broader <Col N="2084"/>scope of records than might be sought by members of the public. </P><Col N="2083"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 to 152, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) that the latest data from the Central Applications Facility (CAF) shows that a total of 49 public servants from outside OSI and 16 OSI staff have applied to decentralise to Dungarvan, Co Waterford.  The indicative data available from CAF indicates that the majority of applicants to decentralise to Dungarvan have administrative backgrounds.  OSI has an integrated grading level structure with a high degree of interchange subject to appropriate training.</P>
        <P>The Decentralisation Implementation Group has adopted an individualised approach to state agencies and while the OSI are not part of the early movers group, arrangements are proceeding within the OSI in accordance with their implementation plan.  They are working towards decentralising to Dungarvan in mid-2009 and training and assignment needs are being addressed in that context.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) that an advertisement was placed by the OPW in the national newspapers and the OJEU on Friday, 13 October 2006, seeking expressions of interest from experienced Developers/ Contractors who wish to be considered in connection with the provision of office accommodation for the OSI in Dungarvan. Expressions of interest are due to be received by Monday, 20 November 2006. This will be followed by a short listing of suitable candidates from whom tenders will be invited on a design/build basis. Subject to finalising the accommodation brief with the OSI, the OPW should be in a position to invite tenders by mid-January 2007.  Evaluation of tenders is expected to result in the selection of a preferred tenderer, who will be required to obtain a satisfactory planning permission. On completion of the planning process, the OPW will instruct the preferred tenderer to submit working drawings and a bill of quantities with a view to a contract being placed and work commencing on site by the mid-2007 target date.  It is estimated that construction will take up to two years and at the end of the construction period, the building would be ready for occupation by the OSI.</P>

The various flood relief proposals as set out in the localised Flood Study report were discussed.  It is now considered that measures to prevent flooding in D&uacute;n Carraig can be designed without the need for the full Rye Catchment Study which would take some time to complete.  The flooding mechanisms involved at Mill Lane are extremely complex and require more detailed consideration.  A further meeting with Kildare County Council officials and their Engineering Consultants has been arranged to try to establish whether an early solution is possible for this area.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The lower aggregate figures in these tables (compared to the slightly higher figures for RACs and PRSAs in the opening table) are taken directly from filed income tax returns which represent about 98% of all income tax returns expected for 2003.  The higher figures in the initial table have, in accordance with normal practice, been grossed-up at aggregate level to adjust for this 2% incompleteness.  The designation of a tax rate to claimants is based on identifying the top tax rate applying to the taxable income of each claimant.  To arrive at the figure for taxable income, the gross income is reduced by various relevant deductions and allowances such as capital allowances, losses, allowable expenses and retirement annuities.  In some cases, these will reduce the taxable income to nil and this reduction itself gives rise to a cost in terms of tax forgone.</P>
        <P>Tax relief for pension contributions by employees is normally given by way of a deduction from total income in arriving at income for tax purposes i.e. the income for tax purposes of employees is net of their pension contributions (the &ldquo;net pay&rdquo; arrangement). The employer&rsquo;s contributions are an allowable deduction from profits and are not specifically recorded in Revenue statistics. However, provisions were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to <Col N="2088"/>improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers/employers.  The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers in February 2006.  These changes will yield additional information regarding the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions but as the returns will be aggregated at employer level they will not provide a precise basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of proposals for changes at individual level.  Work on developing the necessary technical enhancements to the Revenue computer system to enable this data to be captured is ongoing.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the only relevant information available is in respect of income tax relief allowed for contributions to &ldquo;Retirement Annuity Contracts&rdquo; for the income tax year 2003, which are available to the self-<Col N="2089"/>employed and to employees not in occupational pension schemes.  A distribution by income ranges of the number of cases, amount of deduction and reduction in tax for tax relief for Retirement Annuity Contracts is contained in the table that follows this reply.  The information is based on income returns on Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing about 98% of all returns expected.  It is not possible to provide corresponding figures in regard to the take-up of the tax relief for pension contributions by employers and employees as the relevant data are not captured in such a way as to make this possible.  A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as <Col N="2090"/>one tax unit.  Provisions were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers or employers.  The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers in February 2006.  These changes will yield additional information regarding the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions but as the returns will be aggregated at employer level they will not provide a precise basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of proposals for changes at individual level.  Work on developing the necessary technical enhancements to the Revenue computer system to enable this data to be captured is ongoing.</P><Col N="2089"/>

	<P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Ireland has a reduced VAT rate of 13.5% and a standard VAT rate of 21%.  Under the Sixth VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and <Col N="2090"/>services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  However, it is possible to move existing zero rated items to either the reduced rate or the standard rate depending on the item in question.  However, once moved, it would not be possible to revert them to the zero rate.  Member States may have up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5% for a specified number of goods or services which are set out in Annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive.  The goods and services in Annex H include certain foods, non-oral medicines, supply, construction and alteration of housing provided as part of a social policy, and newspapers and periodicals.  Goods and services at the reduced rate may be moved to the standard rate, <Col N="2091"/>but only those listed in Annex H may be reverted from the standard rate to the reduced rate.  In addition, Member States have the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not less than 12%, any items not listed in Annex H, provided they carried the reduced rate on 1 January 1991.  These items are considered to be &ldquo;parked&rdquo; and Ireland&rsquo;s parked rate equates to our reduced rate of<?oasys _jy ?>13.5%.  Domestic fuels, restaurant services and labour intensive services are examples of parked items.  Member States must therefore apply the standard VAT rate to those goods and services that are not subject to VAT at the zero rate and which are not listed in Annex H of the Sixth VAT <Col N="2092"/>Directive.  I hope this helps to clarify the European legislative framework which governs Irish VAT law.</P>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the precise information requested by the Deputy is not available.  The relevant information available is a proportional breakdown by reference to asset types of the aggregate consideration underlying chargeable gains for tax year 2004, that is, the total selling price prior to allowing any offsets or deductions.

        <Quest> the supports available through the taxation system to help a person wishing to return to full time education shortly after having become unemployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of supports in the taxation system may assist unemployed individuals returning to full-time education.  Where, for example, an individual has paid tax during a tax year, he/she may be may qualify for tax relief on tuition fees and/or be entitled to a refund of some (or all) of that tax where he/she returns to full-time education.</P>
        <P>In general, when an individual becomes unemployed, he/she may not, whilst working, have utilised the full amount of his/her tax credits for the tax year during which he/she become unemployed.  In such cases, the granting of the unused portion of tax credits may give rise to a refund of tax already paid for that tax year.   Whether or not a refund of tax is due is dependant on the facts and circumstances of each individual case.  For example, if the individual takes up part-time employment whilst a student, his/her tax credits will be offset against the income for that part-time employment and this will affect the extent of any tax refund in respect of the tax paid whilst in full time employment.  An individual seeking a refund should contact his/her local Revenue office which will determine whether or not a refund of tax due to unemployment may be due at this time.  Alternatively, the individual can wait until the end of the tax year and claim a review of his/her tax liability for 2006 and this will determine the extent of any tax refund that may be due.</P>
        <P>Subject to certain conditions, income tax relief is available in respect of tuition fees paid by an individual to a college approved by the Minister for Education and Science in respect of full time or part-time undergraduate courses, postgraduate courses and information technology and foreign language courses.  Tax relief is available up to a maximum limit of &euro;5,000 per annum at the standard rate of tax (currently 20%).  To qualify for relief, an undergraduate course must be of at least two years&rsquo; duration.  In the case of a postgraduate course, the course must last at least one but not more than four academic years and must lead to a postgraduate award based on either a thesis or an examination.  Tax relief is also available in respect of fees paid for training courses in the areas of information technology and foreign languages.  A foreign language is defined as a language other than an official language of the State (courses in either the English or Irish language do not qualify).  The course must be less than two years in duration and must result in the individual being awarded a certificate of competence on completion.  Relief will only be granted in respect of one course in any year of assessment.  Tuition fees paid by an individual on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian qualify for relief.  The amount of tax repayment due in respect of any such claim is, of course, limited by the amount of the individual&rsquo;s actual tax liability during the relevant tax year.  More com<Col N="2095"/>plete details of the scheme, together with the explanatory leaflet and application form are available on the Revenue website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that statutory redundancy payments are tax free.  <i>Ex gratia</i> redundancy payments in excess of the statutory redundancy amount may also be free of income tax to the extent that they are covered by certain other tax exemptions and reliefs.  In addition, the basic exemption may be increased by an additional amount of up to &euro;10,000 in a case where an individual is not a member of an occupational pension scheme.  If an employee is liable to tax on his/her <i>ex gratia</i> redundancy payment, &ldquo;top-slicing relief&rdquo; may be due, whereby the taxable amount is not charged at the marginal rate, but instead at an average tax rate calculated by reference to the previous three years.</P>

	<P>In practice the tax bands and allowances are increased each year as resources permit.  To provide for this automatically by law is, in my view, not advisable, as the Oireachtas should be allowed the maximum flexibility in deciding the resources to be allocated to tax relief each year and how this relief should be distributed.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Section 53(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Health Act 1970 as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 provides that the Minister for Health and Children &lsquo;shall, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations providing for the imposition of charges for in-patient services in specified circumstances on persons to whom the in-patient services are provided or on specified classes of such persons&rsquo; and Section 53(2)(<i>b</i>) allows for the Minister&rsquo;s &lsquo;specifying the amounts of the charges or the limits to the amounts of the charges to be made&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>The regulations specify the maximum charge which may be levied on either class of person. However, Section 53(4) of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person in order to avoid undue financial hardship to that person.</P>
        <P>The legislation and the regulations do not allow for the assessment of a spouse&rsquo;s income for determination of the weekly charge. The HSE National Guidelines on Long Stay Charges provide that in the case of a married couple only the income which can be attributed to the person to whom the services are provided should be assessed, and in cases where no income can be attributed to that person no charge should be levied.</P>

        <Quest> her proposals to address the rising obesity levels among children, as evidenced in the results of the October 2006 European Commission public consultation on prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases, which revealed that over three million of 14 million overweight children in Europe are obese; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Obesity is a major public health problem both for Ireland and for our European neighbours.  It is estimated that over 300,000 children on the island of Ireland are overweight and obese.  The National Taskforce on Obesity published a report in 2005 containing 93 recommendations to halt the rise in levels of overweight and obesity.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce recognises that a multi-sectoral approach is necessary, involving other state agencies and government departments and real engagement of the public and private sectors to implement all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  It is proposed to utilise social inclusion structures already established as well as other working groups as required to facilitate this.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Health Service Executive has established a Working Group to implement <Col N="2103"/>those recommendations of the Task Force on Obesity for which the HSE has the lead responsibility and for which &euro;3 million has been allocated.   It is currently undertaking an audit of existing services to reduce and prevent obesity, to identify gaps in current service provision and to make recommendations for future service provision.   It has already commenced a number of new initiatives and has secured 8 additional posts this year focused on obesity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government refers to the commitment given in the Health Strategy to provide an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds by 2011.</P>
        <P>In 2001, the year of the publication of the Strategy, the average number of in-patient beds and day places available for treatment of patients in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145.  At the end of 2005, this figure had increased by 1,204 to a total of 13,349, involving an additional 724 in-patient beds and 480 day places.</P>
        <P>In addition, a further 450 acute beds/day places are in various stages of planning and development under the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Capital Plans.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently engaged in a procurement process with the private sector to build and operate private hospitals on 10 public hospital sites.  This will enable up to 1,000 beds in public hospitals, which are currently used by private patients, to be re-designated for use by public patients.</P>
        <P>All of these additional in-patient beds/day places will mean that this Government&rsquo;s commitment in the Health Strategy to increase total acute hospital capacity is well on the way to completion.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a review of tertiary paediatric services undertaken by McKinsey &amp; Company on behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE) advised that:  </P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />It should be in Dublin, and should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital (i.e. should be within a practical walking distance of such a hospital)</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />It should also provide all the secondary (i.e. less complex) hospital needs of children in the Greater Dublin area</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />These secondary services should be supported by strategically located Urgent Care Centres.</P>
        <P FLI="0">When the report was published, each of the Dublin paediatric hospitals (including the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital) expressed strong support for the development of a single paediatric hospital, and emphasised the need for early decisions in relation to its location. Paediatric Consultants expressed their willingness to move to the new hospital regardless of its location.</P>
        <P>Following extensive examination, discussion and consultation, a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Task Group recommended that the new national tertiary paediatric hospital should be built on a site to be made available <Col N="2105"/>by the Mater Hospital.  This recommendation was accepted by the Board of the HSE and was subsequently endorsed by the Government at its meeting on 8th June.  The Government mandated the HSE to move forward with the development of the new hospital and its associated urgent care centres.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister and the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE met with representatives of Tallaght Hospital, including Archbishop Eames, in June to discuss a number of issues, including the implications for the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital of the Government decision to endorse the development of a single national tertiary paediatric hospital at the Mater Hospital.  In a letter to the Archbishop following the meeting, the Taoiseach gave an assurance that the Government wishes to see Tallaght Hospital thrive on a sustainable basis as a particular focal point for the involvement of the minority tradition in the healthcare system and as a key health provider to an expanding local population.</P>
        <P>A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group has been established to advance the development of the national tertiary paediatric hospital.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new hospital and the determination of the range of services and location of the associated urgent care centres.  The Group will have consultations with relevant stakeholders, which will include representatives of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght.</P>
        <P>To date, no decision has been taken in relation to the range of services to be provided at the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght in the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and the associated urgent care centres.</P>

	<P>The telecoms market in Ireland is fully liberalised and open. </P>
        <P>Statutory responsibility for the regulation of the electronic communication sector rests with the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and the Regulations transposing the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications Networks and Services.</P>
        <P>As the Minister with responsibility for policy in the sector, I am concerned about the disruption and inconvenience caused to so many customers and I have asked ComReg to examine how, in light of the recent situation regarding Smart Telecom, this could best be prevented from happening in the future.</P>
        <P>All options will be considered, including legislation if necessary.</P>
        <P>In the context of Energy Tariff Increases under both the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Gas (Interim)(Regulation) Act 2002, responsibility for the regulation of electricity and gas <Col N="2109"/>tariffs lies with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is the independent energy regulator.</P>
        <P>CER undertook a rigorous examination and consultation process in advance of publication of it decisions on the tariff increases. The CER has published its decisions in detail. Together with the Electricity Supply Board and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, CER has made a full presentation on these deliberations to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>The scenario in early October that gave rise to the cheap gas on the wholesale markets was atypical. Overall demand (including heating demand) was at a low level given the mild start to the autumn and supply levels were very high because the new Langeled pipeline from Norway was being tested at maximum capacity at a time when such flows were not needed. Long-term contract prices are more relevant to the cost of consumer energy bills than short-term day trading prices as prevailed in early October. Despite some easing of gas prices in recent months the overall view of regulators, analysts and suppliers is that costs will remain high at least until next year.</P>
        <P>The regulator has indicated that he is open to reviewing tariffs should there be a significant and sustained downward trend in the costs on the wholesale markets.</P>

	<P>Security of supply in relation to electricity is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 60 of 2005). </P>
        <P>These Regulations give further legal effect to Directive No. 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003, concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC, not already implemented by the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the European Communities (Internal market in Electricity) Regulations 2000. The Regulations provide, inter alia, for the strengthening of independent regulation and the enhancing of security of supply provisions.</P>
        <P>Specifically, Article 28 provides that it shall be the duty of the Commission to monitor the security of supply of electricity and that the Commission shall take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply. In the performance of its monitoring and corrective functions, the independent Transmission System Operator, whose functions and independence are provided for under Part 3 of these Regulations, advises the Commission.</P>
        <P>EirGrid plc formally assumed the role of independent electricity Transmission System Operator (TSO) in Ireland and the Market Operator in the wholesale electricity trading system from 1 July 2006.</P>
        <P>EirGrid&rsquo;s statutory role is to deliver quality connection, transmission and market services to generators, suppliers and customers utilising the high voltage electricity system, and to put in place the grid infrastructure required to support the development of Ireland&rsquo;s economy. In fulfilling this role, EirGrid is required to develop, maintain and operate a safe, secure, reliable, economical and efficient transmission system.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation advises me that it is of the view that there are sufficient legislative measures in place to ensure the continuity and security of supply in the generation sector.</P>

	<P>Exchequer expenditure at the Digital Hub since 2000 is approximately &euro;128 million to date. This includes approximately &euro;76 million investment in property and infrastructure as well as approximately &euro;52 million in operational costs. </P>
        <P>The Digital Hub has been and will continue to be successfully developed as a digital industry cluster, as well as a regeneration of a historic community area in the heart of Dublin.</P>
        <P>In October 2005, the Agency announced a competition to develop land in the Digital Hub. This land is to be developed as a mixture of residential, commercial and retail properties, in addition to public spaces. Private developers competed on the basis of bids of cash plus office space.</P>
        <P>In November 2005, I announced the acceptance of tenders for two sites, with a combined area of almost 5.6 acres for approximately &euro;118 million. In return for the land, the State will receive a combination of &euro;72.4 million in cash and &euro;45.7 million in high quality offices, which will accommodate digital enterprises as the Digital Hub grows. The break down of the tenders means that the Digital Hub will receive over 13,000 square metres (140,000 sq.ft.) of office space.</P>
        <P>In relation to industry development in the cluster, about 60 companies, employing approximately 520 employees, are located in the Hub. These enterprises are involved in a range of activities including games software development, mobile technology, animation and TV production.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Security of supply in relation to electricity is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 60 of 2005). Specifically, Article 28 provides that it shall be the duty of the Commission to monitor the security of supply of electricity and that the Commission shall take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply. In the performance of its monitoring and corrective functions, the Commission is advised by the EirGrid, the independent Transmission System Operator. </P>
        <P>Under the 2005 Regulations, the CER is required to publish a report on Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply of electricity. The report describes the Commission&rsquo;s monitoring activities, presents the conclusions drawn from that monitoring and the measures being taken, or planned to be taken, to protect Ireland&rsquo;s security of electricity supply.</P>
        <P>One of the main conclusions of the first Security of Supply of Electricity Report, which was published by the Commission at the end of August this year, is that the development of generation plant producing from fossil fuels will continue to be required in the medium term to ensure security of supply as demand continues to grow. During this time, wind will remain the most significant alternative to fossil fuels on the system. The Commission and EirGrid have put in place mechanisms such as the Group Processing Approach to wind connections to ensure that the <Col N="2118"/>largest sustainable volume of wind is brought onto the system taking into account all technical requirements, including those relating to security and reliability of supply.</P>
        <P>The Commission, in its report, also recognises that the addition of wind and other renewable generation to the energy mix enhances fuel diversity. In particular, both the CER and EirGrid acknowledge that the anticipated growth in renewables will require a generation portfolio, which is flexible and responsive, as well as further interconnection.</P>
        <P>This view is consistent with policy options set out in the Government&rsquo;s recently published Green Paper on Energy, which sets ambitious targets for renewable energy (15% by 2010 and 30% by 2020).</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Government is concerned to ensure that adequate provision is made to encourage the development of an electricity portfolio, which can support and complement the aggressive targets which we have now set for renewable growth. I can assure the Deputy that decisions by the CER, EirGrid and the Government will be informed by the need to ensure capacity and competition in the generation sector while reflecting the overriding consideration of security of supply.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. </P>
        <P>However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broad<Col N="2121"/>band. My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity. The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above.</P>
        <P>For rural communities with populations under 1,500 and the hinterlands of larger towns, my Department offers funding under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) to enable them to become self-sufficient in broadband, in association with service providers. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 160 projects have been approved for funding under this Programme.</P>
        <P>Despite Government investment in broadband in the regions through the regional broadband programme, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Options to address the gaps in broadband coverage are currently being considered.</P>

        <P>I have however, from an overall policy perspective, particularly in the context of the Green Paper, expressed my interest in exploring the possibility of the creation of a State-owned landbank of suitable generation sites to incentivise the development of new independent generation capacity. While consideration is in initial stages, I would expect that lands that become available because of closure would have an important role to play in any such development, subject to any discussions with the company.</P>

	<P>My core policy objectives for the development of the broadcasting sector are detailed in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy, 2005-07. These objectives are to create an environment that encourages the maintenance of high quality Irish radio and television services by both independent broadcasters and RT&Eacute;, to secure a viable future for high quality public service broadcasting and to seek to retain access to a range of high quality programming in analogue and digital form, on a universal and free-to-air basis. </P>
        <P>In this context, the Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003 encourages both private and public broadcasters to include additional programming of a particular character in their programme schedules.</P>
        <P>On 13th October 2005, I wrote to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) formally approving the scheme entitled Sound &amp; Vision.</P>
        <P>This scheme can be used to support the development of additional programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience; programmes aimed at improving adult literacy and in the Irish language. The Act also provides that the scheme may be used for the development of an archive of programme material produced in the State. The scheme is open to broadcasters and independent producers.</P>
        <P>The amount payable annually under Section 4(2) of the Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003, is equal to five per cent of net receipts of broadcasting licence fees. The amount available under the <Col N="2125"/>scheme at the beginning of 2006 stood at in excess of &euro;25m.</P>
        <P>The first round of funding of Sound &amp; Vision announced by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in February 2006 saw the allocation of a total of &euro;11m in funding for programming. This first funding round allocated &euro;10.5m to thirty-seven television projects and &euro;0.5m to forty-five radio initiatives.</P>
        <P>A second round, under the Sound and Vision scheme, was launched by the BCI in March 2006 and has seen the allocation of in excess of &euro;10m; &euro;9.59m has been allocated to thirty-nine television projects and &euro;0.468m to forty-one radio initiatives.</P>
        <P>The BCI propose a third round of funding before the end of 2006.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the conducting of fishing trials, unsanctioned by the EU Commission, by French and Spanish vessels using illegal undersize gillnets in Irish waters; if the vessels carrying on such operations in Irish waters have been arrested and released; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The relevant regulation is Article 42 of EC Regulation 850/98, which allows a derogation for the purpose of scientific research from mesh size and other technical stipulations, in this case the ban on fishing with gill-nets with mesh sizes under 120 mm. Any such research must be carried out with the formal approval of and under the supervision of the flag state, and with advance notification to the Commission and to the coastal state, in this case Ireland.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the need for research involving the use of undersized mesh, and particularly not where the species in question is the subject of protection as part of a recovery plan.</P>
        <P>In recent months French and Spanish vessels have carried out research into species such as hake, megrim and anglerfish, using undersized meshes. In July/August this year I became aware that French vessels were carrying out such experiments in the hake and monkfish fisheries off the west coast. I immediately instructed my officials to raise the matter with the European Commission and the French authorities, with the result that the French authorities instructed their vessels to withdraw the element of their research programme involving undersized meshes.</P>
        <P>More recently, the Department received notification from the Spanish Ministry advising of their intention to carry out similar research in the hake and megrim fisheries. At my request, officials of the Department have again expressed our very strong opposition to the proposal and asked the Commission to intervene to stop such fishing which is completely contrary to the EU plans for conservation and recovery of the stocks. The <Col N="2128"/>Commission has written to the Spanish authorities seeking a justification for the research programmes. Officials from the Department have also met with the Spanish authorities in relation to the matter. One such vessel was indeed arrested while discussions were ongoing with the Commission and the Spanish authorities, but was subsequently released on the basis that it was part of the research programme.</P>
        <P>I have written to Commissioner Borg requesting an amendment to the EU Regulations so that the express approval of the coastal Member State would be necessary for research projects in their Exclusive Fisheries Zone. I will be pressing strongly for the introduction of the amendment over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the control authorities will continue to monitor the activities of any vessels carrying out research in Ireland&rsquo;s waters to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met.</P>

        <Quest> the action he proposes to take to prevent a recurrence of the situation whereby large scale disconnection of telephone and broadband subscribers took place without warning and the unwarranted price increases in respect of gas and electricity while international energy prices are falling; if he will introduce amending legislation to deal with these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The telecommunications market in Ireland is fully liberalised and open.</P>
        <P>Statutory responsibility for the regulation of electronic communication sector rests with the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and <Col N="2129"/>the Regulations transposing the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications Networks and Services.</P>
        <P>ComReg&rsquo;s key objectives include the promotion of competition, and the promotion of the interests of users in the sector.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Communications with responsibility for policy in the sector, I am concerned about the disruption and inconvenience caused to so many customers, and possible damage to customer confidence, and I have asked ComReg to examine how, in light of the recent situation with Smart Telecom, this could best be prevented from happening in the future. All options will be considered, including legislation if necessary.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is required under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002 and relevant subsequent regulations to exercise its functions in a manner that protects the interests of final customers of electricity and natural gas and also to promote competition in the supply of electricity and natural gas.</P>
        <P>The scenario in early October that gave rise to the cheap gas on the wholesale markets was atypical. Overall demand (including heating demand) was at a low level given the mild start to the autumn and supply levels were very high because the new Langeled pipeline from Norway was being tested at maximum capacity at a time when such flows were not needed. Long-term contract prices are more relevant to the cost of consumer energy bills than short-term day trading prices as prevailed in early October. Despite some easing of gas prices in recent months the overall view of regulators, analysts and suppliers is that costs will remain high at least until next year.</P>
        <P>The regulator has indicated that he is open to reviewing tariffs should there be a significant and sustained downward trend in fuel costs on the wholesale markets.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper &ldquo;Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland&rdquo; recently published by my Department has opened up the debate on the shape of policy directions for the future including pricing and competitive issues. I am looking forward to an imaginative debate, which will inform policy in this regard going forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid&rsquo;s Headquarters, and currently based in Dublin, will decentralise to Limerick.  This is scheduled to take place during the third quarter of 2007 and will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts. </P>
        <P>The situation is as follows:</P>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Already, 47 posts in Irish Aid headquarters, including that of Director General, are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. 12 of these officers were already serving within the Department. The remainder is made up of 25 officers who have been recruited from other Departments and Offices via the Central Applications Facility, 7 officers who have been assigned from inter-Departmental promotion panels and 3 newly-recruited officers.</P><Col N="2131"/>
         <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A further 17 officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, are also expected to decentralise to Limerick and will be taking up duty in Irish Aid in advance of the move. The attached table outlines the composition of these 64 posts by reference to their grades.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />In addition, 21 officers from other Departments who have applied to decentralise to Limerick, most of whom are currently based in provincial locations, will transfer to the Department closer to the date of the move. Once these officers take up duty in Irish Aid, 85 posts (69% of the Directorate&rsquo;s staff complement) will be in place.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A small number of staff, approximately 15 at entry grades (Clerical Officer and Third <Col N="2132"/>Secretary), will be recruited locally for direct assignment to Limerick in the months preceding the move.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There are 24 development specialist posts attached to Irish Aid&rsquo;s headquarters. Four Development Specialists and two Senior Development Specialists, who had applied to decentralise, have since decided to withdraw their applications. The specialists, with the support of the IMPACT trade union, say that they are not prepared to consider decentralising while issues around the terms and conditions of their employment are unresolved.</P>
        <P>Discussions are continuing with representatives of the specialists, with IMPACT, and with the Department of Finance with a view to resolving the issues involved which also have a wider Civil Service dimension. It would be my hope that a greater number of Specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick.</P><Col N="2131"/>

	<P>I have set out in the following table the information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of requests received, the amount of application fees collected and the percentage of requests received from journalists. </P>
        <P>I should point out that payment of the normal application fee, currently &euro;15, does not apply in a number of circumstances:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />no fee is payable in respect of requests for personal information;</P><Col N="2133"/>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a reduced fee (currently &euro;10) is payable in respect of requests for non-personal information, where the applicant is a medical card holder; and</P>
  <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />fees are returned to the applicant in cases where the request can be dealt with outside of the Freedom of Information Acts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The appropriate fee has been collected by my Department in all other cases since application fees were introduced in July 2003.</P>
        <P>Our records do not distinguish between different classes of applicants, other than in terms of whether the request is for personal or non-personal information. The information in relation to journalists that is included in the table below, therefore, has been collated on the basis of <Col N="2134"/>requests received from known journalists or from those who identified themselves as journalists when submitting their request under the FoI Acts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In cases where a search and retrieval fee is likely to be sought, it is normal practice in my Department to provide the applicant with an estimate of the fee and to request payment of a deposit. In such cases, however, Departmental officials would also offer to assist the applicant to reformulate the request so as to reduce or eliminate the amount of the deposit and/or the search and retrieval fee. The result has been that this Department has collected a search and retrieval fee in respect of only one FoI applicant, in the amount of &euro;49-98, and that applicant was not a journalist.</P><Col N="2133"/>

        <P>The main vehicle for capital funding through my Department is the Arts &amp; Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS).

        <P>I recently announced a new capital funding scheme &mdash; ACCESS II.  This new scheme will provide grant aid towards the development of arts and culture infrastructure around the country over the years 2007-2009.  Eligible facilities will include integrated arts centres, theatres, galleries, as well as arts studios and creative and performance spaces.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of the scheme will be the refurbishment and enhancement of existing arts and culture facilities.  Accordingly 70% of the total monies available will be allocated to this area.  The remaining 30% of the scheme funds will be available for the development of new facilities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 258 together.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland has estimated that the direct benefit to the economy of hosting of the 2006 Ryder Cup is in the region of &euro;130m.</P>
        <P>It is expected that, over the coming years, there will also be a lasting long-term benefit to the tourism industry, and the golf tourism sector in particular, as a result of the worldwide television coverage of the event and the raising of Ireland&rsquo;s profile generally.  Furthermore, the positive experiences of overseas visitors to the event will serve as a valuable source of word-of-mouth marketing for our tourism industry for many years to come.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in conjunction with the PGA / European Tour, have commissioned Deloitte and Touche to conduct an economic impact assessment on the Ryder Cup in Ireland and I look forward to the results of their work.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland, as provided by Section (8) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act, 2003, is responsible for the encouragement, promotion and support of the development and mar<Col N="2136"/>keting of tourist facilities and services within the State.  As part of its day-to-day operations, it provides support for event-based tourism under such measures as the International Sports Tourism Initiative and the Festivals and Cultural Events Initiative, details of which are contained in the Annual Report and Accounts of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House.</P>

	<P>The following schedule provides a breakdown by sport/activity of the sports capital funding which I allocated in 2005 at local, regional and national level throughout the country. Sports capital funding may be allocated to sporting, voluntary and community organisations and, in certain instances, local authorities, schools and colleges.  The Deputy should note that the <Col N="2137"/>figures for the individual sports are for projects which cater for that sport only, while the category &lsquo;Community/Mixed&rsquo; relates to projects which provide for more than one sport.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Irish Sports Council, the statutory body responsible for the promotion and development of sport in Ireland, provides annual funding to the national governing bodies of sport and other organisations in support of a wide range of programmes and activities for all types and levels of sport throughout the country.  Details of funding provided by the Irish Sports Council is available on its website <i>www.irishsportscouncil.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The average search and retrieval fee charged in respect of Freedom of Information requests made to my Department between 2002 and 2005 was &euro;63.77, &euro;57.99, &euro;40.25 and &euro;45.83 respectively, averaged over all cases where a search and retrieval fee was charged.  The equivalent figure for the first nine months of 2006 was &euro;64.67.  The median search and retrieval fee in respect of each of the years 2002 to 2005 was &euro;51.89, &euro;47.34, &euro;46.95 and &euro;47.62 respectively.  The equivalent figure for the first nine months of 2006 was &euro;54.29.  There were no cases where a search and retrieval fee was waived.  It should be noted that the Freedom of Information Act obliges decision makers (save in a few limited circumstances) to charge search and retrieval fees where significant search and retrieval of records is involved.  The decision to charge a search fee is therefore not a discretionary one, and arises from the scope of a request.</P>

These are: (i) continue to require work permits with the current requirement for a labour market test to establish that the positions cannot be filled from within the European Economic Area, (ii) be granted work permits on foot of a job offer without a labour market test, or (iii) be allowed to participate without any requirement for a work permit.</P>
        <P>The Social Partners have been asked to furnish their views on these options no later than 20th October.  Their responses are awaited.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 275 together.</P>
        <P>My Department through the back to education allowance provides support to long-term social welfare recipients who cannot take up employment because they lack education qualification.</P>
        <P>It is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  Participants in the scheme receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the relevant Social Welfare payment they were in receipt of prior to participation in the scheme.  An annual EUR 400 Cost of Education Allowance is payable to all approved participants at the beginning of each academic year.</P><Col N="2141"/>
        <P>Also, participants continue to receive any secondary benefits to which they would otherwise have an entitlement.</P>
        <P>At present, to qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme an applicant must be, prior to commencing an approved course of study, at least 21 years of age (18 for people with disabilities).  Lone parents and unemployed persons may access the scheme at 18 years if they are out of formal education for 2 years or more.  An applicant must also be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications.  The twelve-month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan.</P>
        <P>The scheme was established to assist people who have been out of the workforce for some time and whose opportunities of obtaining employment would be enhanced by participation in the scheme.  It was not intended for people who have been unemployed for only a short period.</P>
        <P>Any change in the present arrangements would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork has been refused the back to school allowance despite the fact that they received it in 2005 but was refused it both initially and on appeal. </Quest>
        <QRef>[33608/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) Scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>A person may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing and footwear allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course, and has household income at or below certain specified levels. The weekly income limit appropriate to a couple with four children in 2006 is EUR 499.30.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that it has disallowed an application by the person concerned as her household income was above the prescribed EUR 499.30 limit for entitlement to the allowance.</P>
        <P>The person concerned appealed this decision to the area appeals officer of the Executive in June 2006. The Executive has advised that the decision of the community welfare was upheld by the HSE Appeals Office in June 2006.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was refused the back to school clothing and footwear allowance in 2005 <Col N="2142"/>also, again on the grounds that the household income was over the limit. The Health Service Executive has advised that, following that refusal of her BSCFA claim, it awarded her an exceptional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme as a once off measure. It did so because her net income at that time, after paying her mortgage, was broadly in the range covered by the BSCFA scheme.</P>
        <P>The position in 2006 is quite different as the household income now is very substantially over the income limit for BSCFA even after their mortgage repayment is taken into account. The HSE has concluded that the family income is sufficient to provide for school clothing requirements.</P>

No application fees apply to requests for personal records.

        <P>Retrieval fees are charged in non-personal cases only, and only where there is a large volume of records to be retrieved for examination, or where a number of people hold records relevant to the request, or the records are held in a number of areas in my Department.  There has, since 2002, only been one request which has attracted this charge.  The request was from a journalist and the charge occurred in 2003 and amounted to &euro;240.93.  The other information requested by the Deputy, is provided in the Appendix.</P><Col N="2143"/>

	<P>The relevant legislation provides for payment of child benefit to one parent for the benefit of a child or children, where the mother has priority in determining which of the two parents receives the benefit.</P>
        <P>Prior to 1974, child benefit could be paid directly to a child&rsquo;s mother only on the basis of the father&rsquo;s agreement and signature, which was the case in 80% of payments.</P>
        <P>The existing arrangement, whereby child benefit is generally paid to the mother, was introduced on foot of a recommendation of the first Commission on the Status of Women (1972). This approach has subsequently been supported in a number of reports, including the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
        <P>My Department is carrying out at present a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended).</P>
        <P>The review will examine the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, including: gender, marital status and family status that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate.</P>
        <P>This work is being carried out in two phases.  Phase 1 involves a scoping exercise to establish the most appropriate approach and methodology to carrying out the main review.  This work has now been completed and the main review is due to commence at the start of 2007.</P><Col N="2144"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 to 272, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>A special half rate old age contributory pension was introduced in 2000 to enable people with pre-1953 insurance, who could not qualify for a payment under normal qualifying conditions, to receive a pension.  In order to be eligible for the payment, a person requires 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate, which can comprise a mixture of pre and post 1953 contributions.</P>
        <P>At present there are 24,600 people receiving this special pension, many of whom are resident abroad. The number of pre-1953 pensioners broken down by age group is given in the attached table.</P>
        <P>The extra yearly cost of paying a full rate contributory pension to all pre-1953 pensioners would be approximately &euro;123 million. The extra cost of paying a full rate to those who are over 80 years of age would be &euro;31 million.</P><Col N="2145"/>
        <P>The pre-1953 pension is a special measure designed to benefit a particular group of people, with very limited social insurance records, who would not otherwise qualify for a contributory pension. The qualifying conditions work by giving exemption from one of the more important conditions which those applying for standard rate pensions must satisfy, namely the average contributions test.  The basic payment is at present  &euro;96.70 per week, which is equivalent to the rate paid to a person receiving a standard pension who has achieved a yearly average of between 10 and 14 contributions on their social insurance record.  Pre-1953 pensions are increased each year in line with budget increases paid to those on other reduced pensions.</P>
        <P>While I consider that the pre-1953 pension, as it is currently structured, affords an appropriate recognition for the level of contributions which those in question have made.  I will continue to monitor the situation in the context of overall pensions reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 and 274 together.</P>
        <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive, a weekly or monthly rent or mortgage interest supplement is available to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources.</P>
        <P>Rent and mortgage interest supplements are subject to a means test. They are normally calculated to ensure that, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, an eligible person has income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.</P>
        <P>Any income over and above the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate ordinarily leads to a reduction in the amount of rent supplement payable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, a special disregard of up &euro;26 per household per week applies in the means test for rent supplement for people aged 65 or over who are in receipt of a social welfare pension or equivalent payment from another EU country with whom Ireland has a reciprocal agreement.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, where a person has income from part-time employment, the rent supplement scheme provides that the first &euro;60 per week of additional income is disregarded in full with half of any additional income earned between &euro;60 and &euro;90 also disregarded.  This means that for a person getting the state pension (non-contributory) scheme with weekly earnings of &euro;100, &euro;75 of these earnings would be disregarded for rent supplement purposes. This disregard applies to all persons on rent supplement, including pensioners. Taken together, these two disregards mean that a person on the State pension (non-contributory) is &euro;101 better off for having taken up part-time employment than a person on other social welfare payments with no additional income.</P>
        <P>In general, pensioners will not face a reduction in the amount of their rent supplement as a result of an increase in the rate of their primary payment.  However, I do intend to continue to monitor the situation.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the EU US Open Skies deal was discussed at the Transport Council on 12 October 2006.  The Council underlined the importance it attaches to the conclusion of the EU US air transport agreement. It reaffirmed its unanimous satisfaction with the text of the draft agreement negotiated in November 2005 but regretted the further delay in the US position on the ownership and control issue.  The Council requested the Commission to continue its efforts, on the basis of further contacts with the United States to secure a satisfactory and balanced outcome with the necessary safeguards, including the transitional provisions, with a view to a decision at the December Transport Council.  This would fulfil the commitments set out in the conclusion of the June 2006 EU-US summit in which both parties reaffirmed the commitment to reach agreement by the end of the year.  I again drew attention to the negative consequences of failure to finalise the agreement with the EU US for those Member States that do not have open skies agreements in place already. I emphasised therefore the urgency of concluding this matter in December. In the meantime the existing arrangements in the Ireland US bilateral agreement will continue to apply.</P>

	<P>Transport 21 provides for the development of extensive Park and Ride facilities at strategic locations within the Greater Dublin Area and at provincial locations, so as to promote greater use of public transport. A number of guiding principles for the implementation of rail-based Park and Ride strategy have been identified by the Dublin Transportation Office.  These are:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Park and Ride should improve rail accessibility without disimproving road congestion,</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Rail users only should use Park and Ride spaces, and may have to pay to use them,</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Complementary parking controls in the areas around stations may be required,</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Rail fares generally should not be increased to pay for Park and Ride,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Those who benefit from Park and Ride should contribute to the cost of it,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Rail services must be able to serve the demand generated by Park and Ride provision.</P>

	<P>The Agreement between the Minister for Transport and the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) provides, with certain exceptions, for the payment of compensation for insured victims of uninsured drivers in respect of injuries sustained and damage to property.  The Agreement currently in force was signed on 31 March 2004.  Under section 78 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, all insurance companies are required to be members of the MIBI.  Legislation governing motor insurance is being reviewed in the context of EU Directive 2005/14/EC relating to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles.  The Directive amends the preceding motor insurance directives and is required to be transposed into national law by 11 June 2007.  Motor taxation is a matter for the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 285 together.</P>
        <P>Under Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol, forests planted since 1990 are eligible for carbon accounting purposes.  The first Kyoto accounting period will be 2008-2012 and research commissioned by COFORD (National Council for Forest Research and Development) shows that the projected carbon dioxide sequestration over this period amounts to 10.46 million tonnes, based on current average planting rates.  The estimated value of this level of sequestration is &euro;157 million based on a carbon dioxide price of &euro;15 per tonne.  To capitalise fully on the carbon sequestration potential of trees, we need to ensure a vigorous planting programme.  My Department offers 100% grants and attractive <Col N="2152"/>premiums for up to 20 years to encourage the establishment of new forests on agricultural land.  Regarding the planting of trees with a high carbon sequestration capacity, there is little difference between species in the total amounts of carbon dioxide sequestered as crops reach maturity.  All species grant-aided by my Department achieve similarly high levels of carbon-sequestration.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the facilities available in County Wexford for the recycling of waste silage wraps; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The disposal of waste materials generally is covered by the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2005, which apply to all sectors of society including the agricultural sector and is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, manu<Col N="2155"/>facturers and importers of farm plastics &mdash; that is, silage bale wrap and sheeting &mdash; are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market, or alternatively to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group, (IFFPG), is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste. Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste. The Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and my Department has no involvement in the running of the IFFPG scheme.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the IFFPG scheme has lacked sufficient resources to satisfy the demand that existed for collections of farm plastics.  Therefore, following discussions with the IFFPG, farming organisations and local authorities, last May, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr Dick Roche T.D.  announced amendments to the scheme to support improved services to farmers.  Under the new arrangements, the scheme is being funded by a combination of the existing levies paid by the producer members of IFFPG who run the scheme and funding from weight based collection charges to be paid by farmers availing of the service.    I have been informed that the effect of the new arrangements will be to ensure that the  farm plastics collection service provided by the IFFPG to farmers can match the demand on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>I understand from my colleague, Minister Roche, that, to address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap. This service, which operated on a pilot basis in some counties during the summer, is free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government through the Environment Fund.  The scheme is being rolled out to other counties on a staggered basis and I have been informed that announcements regarding further extensions of collections to other areas, including Wexford, will follow completion of collections in those counties taking part in the recently announced second phase of the scheme.</P>

        <Quest> the steps she is taking to ensure that cattle passports are returned to farm<Col N="2156"/>ers in a shorter timescale than at present following a herd test; if her attention has been drawn to the hardship such a delay causes farmers; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[33783/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Herd tests are for the most part arranged by farmers with their veterinary practitioners. A keeper must surrender all passports, including any surplus passports, to the testing veterinary surgeon at the commencement of the test. If all of the animals tested are properly identified and give a clear (negative) result, the corresponding passports are certified by the veterinarian and returned to the keeper. However, the PVP is required to submit any surplus, complete (full) and incorrect passports to the DVO. On receipt the DVO will arrange where appropriate for replacement passports to issue promptly to the keeper. If any animal gives a positive reaction to the test, the veterinarian will forward all passports to the DVO which will hold them until the herd is clear. In that case, the passports are returned, following the clear test result, to the private veterinary practitioner who certifies and returns them to the keeper. Where an animal gives an inconclusive reactor result, in general, the passport for the inconclusive animal is retained by the DVO and the remaining passports are returned to the private veterinary practitioner to be certified and returned to the farmer. </P>
        <P>Animals that are presented for test, but which are not properly tagged and registered, have to be temporarily tagged/identified in the course of the test. In such cases, the procedure is that all passports are retained and the keeper is required to properly tag the unidentified animal(s) and to complete and submit form ER 96 correlating those unidentified animals. In these cases, passports will not be returned to keepers until that form has been submitted to and processed satisfactorily by my Department&rsquo;s DVO.  I am not aware of any specific complaints concerning delays in the return of passports.</P>
        <P>For TB, the herd test results are, in general, available on the day of completion of the test while Brucellosis test results are provided when they become available from the Laboratory. Once clear test results are available, there is no reason why private veterinary practitioners should delay returning the passports and as farmers pay the veterinarians for most herd tests, there is no reason why they cannot make arrangements to ensure that this is the case.</P>
        <P>In other circumstances, passports are returned as soon as possible after completion of clearance or other tests and/or where animal identification issues have been satisfactorily dealt with.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Categories A, B, C and D.  Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died before 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002. The person named was not successful under this category as the land acquired was not leased out during the reference period. </P>
        <P>Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January, 2000 and 19 October, 2003 made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments. The person named applied under B(i) in relation to purchased/leased land and has been deemed unsuccessful as he did not make an investment in land either by purchase or long term lease. He also applied under category B(ii) for suckler quota purchased and has been deemed successful under this category.</P>
        <P>Category C caters for farmers who sold their milk quota into the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. The person named was deemed unsuccessful under this category as the conversion from dairying to another farming sector is already reflected in the value of his Single Payment entitlements.</P>
        <P>Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year. The person named was deemed unsuccessful as he did not comply with the off-farm income limits as required under this category.</P>
        <P>A formal letter of decision together with relevant payment due in respect of category B(ii) will issue shortly to the person named. If the person named is dissatisfied with my Department&rsquo;s decision in relation to the National Reserve he will then have the opportunity to appeal this decision to the Independent Payment Appeals Committee.  An appeals application form is available from any of my Department&rsquo;s offices or on <?oasys _dc18- ?>the Department website at <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie</i>.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

	<P>The cost of providing the computer infrastructure at the 2006 Ploughing Championships was &euro;9270.50; this was the cost of the telecommunications infrastructure.  The remaining IT equipment deployed at the ploughing championship was from current Department IT hardware stock and has been returned to general use within the Department.</P>
        <P>This type of technology is used to provide online electronic service to farmers over the Internet.  Already farmers can view and print their maps and other information related to their Single Payment claims.  They can view and print their full herd details, including all movements, and download this information to farm software.  They can also register calf births online.  For 2007 it is also planned that they can apply for their Single Payment online.</P>
        <P>Similar computer equipment has been deployed in the Department&rsquo;s local offices for a number of years.  The equipment has been upgraded on a regular basis, in line with the Department&rsquo;s IT Strategy to keep its IT infrastructure up-to-date.  Access to all of the Department&rsquo;s information is available to staff in local offices, including our business processing systems.  Where schemes are delivered locally, staff in the local offices can provide a full service using the latest technology.  Where schemes are delivered centrally, this type of service is available through dedicated lo-call numbers, where staff in the call centre have access to the full range of information to resolve any queries.  My Department is constantly reviewing how best to optimise delivery of its service to farmers.</P>

	<P>A Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Early Childhood Care and Education was sanctioned by my Department as part of the 2005/06 Programme for the Institute of Technology Tralee. <Col N="2159"/>The course was sanctioned on the understanding that the Institute was satisfied that it could meet the operational costs of the full cycle of the course and there would be no additional staffing requirements for the duration of the course. I understand that the course commenced in September 2005. </P>
        <P>The annual budget for each Institute of Technology is at present allocated on the basis of its total pay and non-pay requirements following consideration of its annual Programmes and Budget submission which is required under the RTC/DIT Acts. The allocation takes into account the complexity of the Institute, the range of courses and facilities offered to students, the total number of students, (both full-time and part-time) and the nature of the infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Institutes of Technology Act 2006 provides that the HEA rather than the Minister will in future approve Institutes&rsquo; budgets. The new budgetary arrangements provided for in the Act are similar to those obtaining in the Universities. They will allow the Institutes greater operational and academic freedom to provide courses in accordance with their overall remit.</P>

	<P>My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs, such as: learning support/remedial and resource teaching support; special needs assistant support; funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education Act, 2005.  With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and/or special needs assistant support for the pupil.</P>
        <P>My officials have been advised by the NCSE that the application for special educational needs support for the pupil was received. However, the pupil in question did not meet the criteria for allocation of additional resources. A decision on the application was issued to the school in June 2006.</P>
        <P>As the NCSE has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education Act, 2005, it would not be appropriate to intervene.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year was outlined in Primary Circular 23/06 which was issued to all primary schools. </P>
        <P>The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005/2006 school year was a principal and 16 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 443 pupils on 30 September 2004. The school also had 3 learning support/resource posts (2 on permanent basis and 1 temporary) and the services of one shared permanent resource teacher for travellers based in the school.</P>
        <P>The staffing for the current year is a principal and 15 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 415 pupils on 30th September 2005.  The school also has 3 permanent learning support/resource posts, the services of a shared permanent resource teacher and a shared permanent resource teacher for travellers both based in the school.</P>
        <P>All primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children for the 2005/06 school year. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &ndash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on. This year (2006/07) this figure has been reduced to 28 children and next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P><Col N="2162"/>
        <P>With the major expansion in teacher numbers provided by this Government in recent years there are now 4,000 more teachers in our primary schools than there were in 2002. Indeed, there are 1,000 more teachers in September 2006 than there were in September 2005.</P>
        <P>This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</P>

	<P>The building project for the School referred to by the Deputy was one of the sixty two projects that I announced to start the architectural planning process in January of this year.  The brief for the project consists of a 16 classroom Generic Repeat Design with an additional bolt-on Special Education Tuition room.  A Design Team was appointed on the project in June of this year and following a briefing seminar in my Department&rsquo;s Offices in Tullamore, the Design Team were instructed to proceed to stage 3 (detailed design with costings) of my Department&rsquo;s Design Team Procedures.</P>
        <P>When the stage 3 submission is received in my Department, my Officials will arrange a meeting with the School Authorities and the Design Team in order to evaluate the documentation. It is envisaged that unless there are very exceptional circumstances involved, the meeting will be sufficient to authorise the project to progress to the next stages of architectural planning.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP.  These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</P><Col N="2165"/>
        <P>An application for review was received from the school referred to by the Deputy and was thoroughly examined by the Review Group.  In accordance with the recommendations of the Review Group, the school has not been identified for inclusion in the School Support Programme and the Principal was informed by letter on 4th August.</P>
        <P>Schools which have not qualified for the new School Support Programme and which are receiving additional resources, both human and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing disadvantage, will retain these supports for the 2006/2007 school year.  After that, such schools will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including making arrangements for the marking of work presented for examinations and issuing the results of examinations.</P>
        <P>Arrangements for the assessment of candidates with special needs in the certificate examinations were the subject of lengthy consultation and consideration by an Expert Advisory Group on Certificate Examinations.</P><Col N="2166"/>
        <P>The group recognised that there are cases where many of the elements of a subject that are marked in the examination are accessible to a student but some, because of a particular difficulty the student has, are not.  An example is the aural component of a language subject that may not be accessible to a student with a hearing impairment.  The Group contended that it was reasonable to allow a student to sit for examination in the components of the subject in which achievement was possible, and to exempt the student from the specific and identifiable elements when it was not.  What this means is that the national standard for assessment should be modified to accommodate the student and this modification is enabled by including an explanatory note with the results.</P>
        <P>These measures make the examination system more flexible and responsive to the needs of students who would otherwise have difficulty with some examination subjects because of their special needs.  This represents a significant <Col N="2167"/>advance in the inclusiveness of the examination system.</P>
        <P>I want to assure the Deputy that in implementing these measures the State Examinations Commission confines any explanatory note to the assessment issue in the subject or subjects concerned.  There is no reference to the special needs of the candidate or to the accommodation provided.  The note explains only how the standard national assessment was modified. The annotation on certificates does not impact on CAO offers of third level places to students.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy has not provided any details I cannot comment on the specific case to which he refers.  However, I am aware that some second-level schools do not appear to be doing as much as they could to ensure that students with special needs are as welcome in those schools as students without special needs. I expressed my belief in this regard at the Annual Conference of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.</P>
        <P>The Education Act, 1998 requires all schools to have in place an admissions policy, detailing admission to and participation by students with disabilities or who have other special educational needs.  The Act also requires schools to ensure that as regards that policy the principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</P>
        <P>My Department provides a range of supports to all schools to enable them to welcome students with special educational needs.  My Department allocates additional teacher support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and VECs to cater for students with special educational needs.  The nature and level of support provided in each case is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual student.  However, this requires a willingness on the part of schools to be proactive in this area and also a willingness on the part of parents to more actively assert their rights in terms of their choice of school.</P>
        <P>Currently, under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld <Col N="2168"/>the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision.  I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the new school to which he refers opened in September 2005. The school was given approval to enrol two Junior Infant Classes per year and, when fully occupied, will operate as a two-stream 16-classroom school.  This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over-enrolment in the early stages and crucially, to ensure that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this position and as an exceptional matter, the school authority has been given approval to enrol three junior infants classes for the 2006/07 school year only, on the grounds that this will not impact negatively on the other schools in question.</P><Col N="2170"/>
        <P>Approval has also been given to enrol an additional 40 pupils up the classes that could not obtain places in other schools in the area. Pupils moving into the area in the course of the school year can also enrol in the school on the same basis.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Deputy can be assured that my Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities for all pupils attending primary schools. The provision of such facilities is an integral part of the design process for new school buildings or where an existing school building is undergoing major refurbishment.</P>
        <P>In primary schools new PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme. Regarding specific sports equipment grants, in recent years, my Department has provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools specifically for this purpose to enable them to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Such materials and equipment would normally have a useful life of several years.</P>
        <P>Schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula including Physical Education. Also, all primary schools with permanent recognition receive an annual Minor Works Grant from my Department.  Each school gets a standard rate of &euro;3,809 together with a per pupil rate of &euro;12.70. Special Schools and schools with special classes receive an enhanced per pupil rate of &euro;50.80.  It is open to school management authorities to use this devolved grant for the purchase of equipment, including physical education equipment, provided it is not required for more urgent works.</P>
        <P>Primary schools that establish a class for special needs pupils receive a once-off grant of &euro;6,500 per class to purchase equipment, including physical education equipment, that they feel best meets the needs of the pupils attending the class.  My Department also considers applications for additional grant aid for such equipment where schools can demonstrate that the minor works grant funding is insufficient for this purpose.</P>

However, I must point out that as the school in question  is a voluntary secondary school the decision to withdraw as providers of Education is within the remit of the Patron body, that is the Sisters of Mercy.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are sufficient places available to meet demand in a given area. My officials are examining the implications of the phased closure with a view to ensuring that the educational needs of the children in the area continue to be met.</P>
        <P>Capital investment of &euro;305,505 has been made in the school since 2000.  Current funding for Seamount, Kinvara, in line with the funding of Voluntary Secondary schools generally, is structured on the basis of per capita grants, based on enrolments, with additional support for caretaking and secretarial support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been substantial progress made in the funding of our schools since 2003. Spending by my Department on second level education increased by 17% between 2003 and 2005. In 2005 &euro;2.7 billion was spent on second-level education, up from &euro;2.3 billion in 2003 and &euro;1.25 billion in 1997. These increases have allowed for major progress to be made both in the staffing and in the day-to-day funding of our schools. </P>
        <P>Day to day funding for our schools has increased significantly in recent years. The standard capitation grant of &euro;266 per pupil in 2003 <Col N="2174"/>now stands at &euro;298 per pupil from 1 January last. In addition, the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from &euro;127 per pupil in 2003 to &euro;159 per pupil from January last. This per capita grant is in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some &euro;15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>These significant increases in the funding and staffing of schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. While there is no doubt that issues of demographics and parental choice will have an impact on the future shape of educational delivery in Ireland, I have no plans to alter the current funding arrangements.</P>

        <P>The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a variety of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for pupils awaiting a suitable educational placement.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the scheme itself has not changed.  However, on review of a number of applications for home tuition, details concerning the qualifications of some of the proposed tuition providers gave rise to concern.  As home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, the Deputy will appreciate the need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned.  The usual requirement is a fully qualified teacher.  However other qualifications are acceptable depending on the individual needs of the child. In this context a review of qualifications is under way in consultation with my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate.</P>
        <P>Nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than teaching qualifications have been accepted for the first school term this year to allow time to establish the suitability of the range of qualifications submitted. As the process progresses the parents concerned will be informed of the decision which will result in approval for subsequent terms of the nominated tuition provider or direction to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications. It is important to stress that the allocation of tuition hours under the scheme is not at issue in the context of the review of qualifications in this regard.</P>

	<P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees. Under the Free Fees Initiative, my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration.</P>
        <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Grant Schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The Acts make special provision for the assessment of means in the case of mature students. Under the terms of the Higher Education Grants Scheme, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; income or address. The statutory definition of a mature student is a person of not less than 23 years of age who has reached that age on the 1st day of January in the year of entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>The other schemes of student support for third level students have similar provisions.  Apart from the funding provided through the student maintenance grant schemes, my Department also provides funding to the approved third level institutions to operate a Student Assistance Fund to assist students in a compassionate and sensitive manner who may otherwise have to leave college due to financial hardship. Information on the fund is available from the Student Access Officers at the approved third level colleges.</P><Col N="2178"/>
        <P>I would also draw attention to the Millennium Partnership Fund whose objective is to support students from disadvantaged areas with regard to  retention and participation in further or higher education courses.  Partnership Companies and Community Groups manage the fund at a local level.</P>

	<P>The National Vehicle and Driver File database (NVDF) is a record of &ldquo;keepers&rdquo; of vehicles and not legally entitled owners.  This principle is reflected in motor tax law where responsibility for taxing a vehicle rests with its &ldquo;keeper&rdquo;.  Section 60 of the Finance Act 1993 enables the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to determine the content of records on the NVDF.  In this respect, my Department confirmed to motor tax officers, in March 2006, that a vehicle record is limited to one named registered owner and joint owners are not permitted.</P>
        <P>This approach for motor taxation purposes takes account of judicial comments at District Court level, that prosecutions for road traffic and other vehicle related offences, including penalty points offences, cannot be successfully pursued against joint owners. A number of prosecutions have been dismissed on this basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Conservation work on the monuments on Skellig Michael began in the late 1970s. The work now being undertaken on the South Peak by the Office of Public Works in conjunction with my Department is a continuation of a long term programme. The primary focus of the works in relation to the monastic remains on the South Peak is preserving and securing these remains from a real danger of further loss.</P><Col N="2185"/>
        <P Just="Left">Work began on the South Peak during 2004, and is scheduled for completion in 2007.  This has involved an excavation with subsequent consolidation and conservation. It has been necessary to carry out reconstruction work in certain areas to provide support for the existing structures which are vital to the preservation of the site.  All archaeological works are carried out with consents of the Minister under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004.  The joint OPW-DoEHLG team responsible for the conservation and preservation work on the South Peak comprises professionals who are highly qualified and experienced to undertake such work, including a conservation architect and archaeologist who specialise in the Early Christian period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no question of a 9th century altar being destroyed as referred to in the Question. The position is that most of the oratory in which the altar was located had collapsed over time, including the east wall, taking with it most of the original altar. During the process of excavation the remains of the altar were uncovered, in a very unstable condition. Further excavation revealed an open gully running under the church. In order to stabilise the church it was necessary to record the remains of the altar in situ and temporarily remove it under archeological supervision. Once the structural intervention had stabilised the church the altar was put back in its original position.</P>
        <P>UNESCO were provided with detailed information regarding the proposed management strategy including the on-going and future conservation programme for the Skellig Michael site prior to it being inscribed as a World Heritage site in 1996.  In relation to conservation works, it is stated on page 23 of the Nominations Documents that &ldquo;the current programme of preservation and conservation works began in 1978 and will continue into the next millennium.... These works have necessitated major structural intervention in places; this has only been undertaken where there has been no other avenue open&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The type of work being undertaken at the site was presented to representatives of UNESCO, particularly in relation to authenticity, as part of the decision making process on the application for World Heritage Site designation. The fundamental approach to the preservation of the site has not changed. In addition, during the course of 2005 my Department submitted a detailed periodic reporting document to UNESCO on all facets of Skellig Michael.</P>
        <P>With regard to the future of the site, my Department, in collaboration with OPW, is currently updating and expanding the management strategy set out prior to the 1996 inscription. It is hoped that a public consultation process on the new management plan for the site plan can be undertaken in early 2007 and that the plan will <Col N="2186"/>be published in April/May 2007, prior to the commencement of the 2007 visitor season.</P>
        <P>A scientific expert from the National Parks and Wildlife Service also provided advice on the works and was satisfied that the works on the archaeological heritage of the site would not have a significant impact on the birdlife there. The stability of the bird populations on Skellig Michael throughout the work programme provides objective evidence that this advice was correct.</P>

	<P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources reported in June 2005 on Non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts.  The Report made 11 recommendations, including a recommendation that planning guidelines and planning exemptions be examined with a view to ensuring that no &lsquo;electromagnetic emissions&rsquo; or &lsquo;radio frequency emissions&rsquo; emitting equipment be permitted to be sited near health centres, schools or other sensitive sites such as playgrounds or pitches etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following this report, an inter-departmental advisory committee and an expert group, working to the committee, has been established to provide advice on the appropriate action to be taken on foot of the report's recommendations.  The work of the committee and expert group is in train and I expect it to be finalised by the end of 2006, following which appropriate action will be addressed.</P>
        <P>I intend shortly to bring forward proposals to revise the exempted development regulations to ensure that they support the use of renewable energy for domestic users.  Revisions to the exempted development regulations, for example to permit the construction of small wind turbines without planning permission, would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>In July 2006 I <Col N="2187"/>announced that I had authorised the Office of Public Works to commission a new &euro;3 million Visitor Centre for historic Nenagh Castle.  I also agreed to the transfer of the Castle Field to Nenagh Town Council thereby giving local control over management, maintenance and security matters in the vicinity of the Castle and ensuring the continuity of this space as a public amenity in perpetuity.</P><Col N="2188"/>
        <P>I am advised by the Office of Public Works that they are in consultation with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor regarding the preparation of a draft lease to give effect to my decision concerning the transfer of the Castle Field.  I understand that a draft lease will issue to Nenagh Town Council in the near future.</P>
